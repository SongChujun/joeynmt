new york – as the us congress considers whether to authorize american military intervention in syria , its members should bear in mind a basic truth : while syrian president bashar al-assad has repeatedly used extreme violence to retain power , the united states – and other governments in the middle east and europe – share responsibility for turning syria into a killing field .
these governments , led by the us , have explicitly sought the violent overthrow of assad .
without their involvement , assad ’ s regime would most likely have remained repressive ; with their involvement , syria has become a site of mass death and destruction .
more than 100,000 people have died , and many of the world ’ s cultural and archaeological treasures have been demolished .
syria ’ s civil war has occurred in two phases .
the first phase , roughly from january 2011 until march 2012 , was largely an internal affair .
when the arab spring erupted in tunisia and egypt in january 2011 , protests erupted in syria as well .
in addition to the usual grievances under a brutal regime , syrians were reeling from a massive drought and soaring food prices .
the protests became a military rebellion when parts of the syrian army broke with the regime and established the free syrian army .
neighboring turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground , giving sanctuary to rebel forces along its border with syria .
although the violence was escalating , the death toll was still in the thousands , not tens of thousands .
the second phase began when the us helped to organize a large group of countries to back the rebellion .
at a meeting of foreign ministers in istanbul on april 1 , 2012 , the us and other countries pledged active financial and logistical support for the free syrian army .
most important , then-secretary of state hillary clinton declared : “ we think assad must go . ”
that open-ended statement , without any clear means to achieve the goal that it announced , has done much to fuel military escalation and the rising death toll in syria , while pushing the us repeatedly to defend its “ credibility ” against a line in the sand that it should not have drawn .
then and now , the us has claimed to speak in the interest of the syrian people .
this is very doubtful .
the us views syria mainly through the lens of iran , seeking to depose assad in order to deprive iran ’ s leaders of an important ally in the region , one that borders israel .
the us-led effort in syria is thus best understood as a proxy war with iran – a cynical strategy that has contributed to the massive rise in violence .
the us government ’ s misguided move from potential mediator and problem solver to active backer of the syrian insurrection was , predictably , a terrible mistake .
it put the us in effective opposition to the united nations peace initiative then being led by former un secretary-general kofi annan , whose approach was to call for a ceasefire followed by a negotiated political transition .
the us preempted this process by backing the military rebellion and insisting on assad ’ s immediate departure .
it is hard to understand this blunder .
even if the us ultimately sought to force assad from office , its blunt action hardened assad ’ s resistance , as well as that of his two allies in the un security council , russia and china .
aside from seeking to defend their own interests in the region , both countries understandably rejected the idea of us-led regime change in syria .
russia argued that america ’ s insistence on assad ’ s immediate departure was an impediment to peace .
in this , russia was right .
indeed , russia was playing a plausibly constructive role at the time , albeit one premised on assad remaining in power for at least a transitional period , if not indefinitely .
russia sought a pragmatic approach that would protect its commercial interests in syria and its naval base at the port of tartus , while bringing an end to the bloodletting .
the russians openly backed annan ’ s peace initiative .
yet , with the us and others financing the rebels , russia ( and iran ) supplied more – and more sophisticated – weapons to the regime .
now , with the use of chemical weapons , probably by the syrian government ( and possibly by both sides ) , the us has again ratcheted up the stakes .
bypassing the un once again , the us is declaring its intention to intervene directly by bombing syria , ostensibly to deter the future use of chemical weapons .
america ’ s motivations are not entirely clear .
perhaps there is no underlying foreign-policy logic , but only carelessness .
if there is a kind of logic , however weak , it seems to revolve around iran and israel , rather than syria per se .
there are many dictatorships in the world that the us does not try to overthrow .
on the contrary , many of them are ostensibly america ’ s close allies .
so why does the us continue to back a deadly rebellion in a civil war that is continuing to escalate dangerously , now to the point of chemical-weapons attacks ?
to put it simply , president barack obama ’ s administration has inherited the neoconservative philosophy of regime change in the middle east .
the overriding idea is that the us and its close allies get to choose who governs in the region .
assad must go not because he is authoritarian , but because he is allied with iran , which , from the perspective of the us , israel , turkey , and several gulf countries , makes him a regional threat .
in fact , the us has probably been lured into serving these countries ’ own narrower interests , whether it be israel ’ s unconvincing vision of its own security or the sunni countries ’ opposition to shia iran .
but , in the long term , us foreign policy divorced from international law cannot produce anything other than more war .
the us should reverse course .
a direct us attack on syria without un backing is far more likely to inflame the region than it is to resolve the crisis there – a point well appreciated in the united kingdom , where parliament bucked the government by rejecting british participation in a military strike .
instead , the us should provide evidence of the chemical attacks to the un ; call on the security council to condemn the perpetrators ; and refer such violations to the international criminal court .
moreover , the obama administration should try to work with russia and china to enforce the chemical weapons convention .
if the us fails in this , while acting diplomatically and transparently ( without a unilateral attack ) , russia and china would find themselves globally isolated on this important issue .
more broadly , the us should stop using countries like syria as proxies against iran .
withdrawal of us financial and logistical support for the rebellion , and calling on others to do the same , would not address syria ’ s authoritarianism or resolve america ’ s issues with iran , but it would stop or greatly reduce the large-scale killing and destruction in syria itself .
it would also enable the un peace process to resume , this time with the us and russia working together to restrain violence , keep al qaeda at bay ( a shared interest ) , and find a longer-term pragmatic solution to syria ’ s deep domestic divisions .
and the search for a us modus vivendi with iran – where a new president suggests a change of course on foreign policy – could be revived .
it is time for the us to help stop the killing in syria .
that means abandoning the fantasy that it can or should determine who rules in the middle east .

why america will lead the “ asian century ”
true , american power will inevitably decline in relative terms as asian giants such as china and india rise .
but , at least as far as asia is concerned , arguments about the end of american hegemony ring hollow .
for one thing , the united states was never a hegemon in asia .
only some american post-cold war triumpha@@ lists thought it was .
the nature of us power and the exercise of its influence was always much more clever and subtle than most assume .
in fact , as india and china rise , the us could actually find itself in a stronger position .
how can this be ?
after all , power and influence are built on the back of economic success .
the chinese economy has been doubling in size every ten years since 1978 .
the indian economy has been doing the same since 1991 .
in contrast , it takes about two decades for the us economy to double in size .
doesn ’ t this surely mean that asia is rushing toward a state of multi-polarity – a configuration of roughly equal great powers balancing against each other – while american influence is on the wane ?
the seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that asia has a unique kind of hierarchical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design .
no power can be preeminent if it cannot maintain its military advantage over rivals .
yet , despite the fact that america spends more on defense than the next ten powers combined , it has never been a regional hegemon because it actually relies on the cooperation of other states to remain predominant .
without cooperation from allies such as japan , south korea , singapore , and the philippines , the us could not retain its forward military positions in the west pacific .
likewise , the us needs the cooperation of indonesia , malaysia , and thailand to host its critical radar infrastructure .
moreover , in remaining preeminent , america requires other key states and regional groupings , such as asean , to acquiesce in its security relationships .
thus , there is broad-based regional approval of us alliances with japan , south korea , and australia , as well as with partners such as the philippines , singapore , thailand , and india .
the key to the effectiveness of these bilateral relationships is that they enjoy widespread support ( and thus legitimacy ) in the region as stabilizing arrangements .
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
combined with the raw military capacity that the us brings to the table , this means that america is powerful enough to enforce the peace and provide stability for commerce to thrive .
america ’ s presence and bilateral partnerships are complementary to asian states ’ obsession with counter-@@ dominance and non-interference in the region .
this dynamic “ liberal order ” – largely fair , flexible , and open enough to welcome new entrants as they rise – will continue to serve asia well .
for example , even china has been a major beneficiary of the public goods provided by the us-led hierarchical system .
this interdependent relationship means that the us is not so powerful , that it can readily ignore the wishes of key states , and it is here that its apparent weakness is actually strength .
america is not a hobbesian leviathan with absolute authority and power .
indeed , china ’ s strategists are frequently puzzled by the lack of “ balancing ” that takes place against the us in the region .
but it is puzzling only if we characterize asia as being multi-polar rather than hierarchical .
in fact , any balancing tends to take place in order to preserve the hierarchy , not to replace or supersede it .
other states tend to resist bids by any asian power – be it japan , china or india – to rise to the top of the pyramid .
as a foreign-based power , the us needs the cooperation of asian partners .
this keeps the top dog in check .
were an asian country like china to rise to the top , it would not need the same level of regional cooperation and acquiescence to maintain its position and military footholds .
as china and india rise , and japan becomes more “ normal , ” they will balance each other within the us-led hierarchy to ensure that the us remains on top and one or the other doesn ’ t dominate .
if china makes a bid for regional hegemony , it will find it difficult to resist the structural constraints placed on it within this hierarchy .
us power is in relative decline , but that is no bad thing .
false triumphalism breeds poor discipline .
but a sense of strategic vulnerability breeds interdependency , which has always been the key to successful us leadership in asia .

why an american recovery matters
milan – it is hard to be optimistic about america at present .
with the help of crucial government support in the crisis , the us financial sector ( or at least parts of it ) has bounced back , while america ’ s real economy struggles with high unemployment , discouraged labor-force dropouts , and damaged balance sheets .
so it is no surprise that the american public and the us congress are angry .
the focus of that anger has been the massive and unwise financial-sector bonuses .
as a result , regulatory reforms have thus far consisted of , first , a threat to the federal reserve ’ s autonomy , and , second , a tax on bonuses .
the first idea is a bad one .
the latter may be politically mandatory and marginally beneficial in fiscal terms . its effects on risk-taking are debatable .
but the much-needed structural reforms to limit leverage and contain the risks that the financial system periodically imposes on the real economy – and the public purse – have only belatedly gotten off the to-do list , and the prospects of enacting them are difficult to estimate .
in fairness , the new rule proposed by former us federal reserve chairman paul volcker to separate financial intermediation from proprietary trading is not a bad idea .
combined with elevated capital requirements for banks , it would reduce the chance of another simultaneous failure of all credit channels .
but it is not sufficient .
hedge funds can also destabilize the system , as the collapse of long term capital management in 1998 demonstrated .
so they also need clear , albeit different , limits on leverage .
health-care reform has deeply divided the american public and us politicians alike .
whatever the merits and shortcomings of various proposals , these divisions suppressed the bipartisan aspects of the political process and emphasized its zero-sum dimension .
one might expect that after a dangerous crisis rooted in growing structural imbalances and an unsustainable growth pattern on the demand side , there would be serious , ongoing debate about what is needed to restore long-term growth and productive job creation in the context of a rapidly evolving global economy .
but there is not , which is both puzzling and worrisome .
this is not to say that the us economy has lost its dynamism .
far from it .
but in the long term , sustaining it will require far-sighted public policies and investments in hard and soft infrastructure to support the private sector ’ s high capacity for innovation .
there are those who disagree and believe that an economy ’ s dynamism is found almost entirely in the private sector , while the task of government is mainly to stay out of the way .
still others accept that government could in principal do something useful , but believe that it normally does not , and that the risks outweigh the benefits .
a policy agenda in the us that is overloaded , overwhelmingly domestically focused , and partially paralyzed will mean a lack of attention to global issues that require cooperation and compromise , including the international dimensions of financial reform .
absent coordination , there is also a risk that monetary policies designed to promote growth ( or at least not impede it ) will lead to a return of financial-sector distortions and imbalances .
the rebalancing and restoration of global demand in the medium term is discussed within the g-20 , but has not really gotten underway .
from the perspectives of both policy and investment , the short and medium term is once again risky .
many countries , including developing ones , will adopt defensive postures , some of which , such as making better use of the domestic market as a driver of growth , will have broadly positive impacts , even if growth prospects are somewhat diminished in the aggregate .
more importantly , the crisis highlighted the risks associated with high dependence on foreign capital .
that , combined with slow progress on financial-sector reform , makes it likely that risk-aversion will prevail , which could slow , if not reverse , financial globalization , and probably lead to slower growth in many countries .
restarting the doha round of trade negotiations with a more manageable agenda – and one focused on the poorer and more vulnerable developing countries – would be a good way to revive progress on trade .
but , in an environment of slow growth and high unemployment , sentiment in the advanced countries regarding efforts to liberalize trade is distinctly negative .
the restoration of growth and balance in the us economy is crucially important , not only for its effect on global growth , but also as a foundation for tackling a broad array of international problems and challenges .
right now , it looks as though creating that foundation is on hold .
outside the advanced countries , there is a view that the world will return to pre-crisis conditions , with a stable us that functions as borrower , lender , and consumer of last resort .
what this perspective ignores is that pre-crisis growth in the us and the global economy was based in part on an unsustainable configuration .
returning to that model is neither likely nor wise .
while a relatively high and sustainable growth pattern can be achieved , it will take time .
and it will occur ( if it does ) in a global economy with fundamentally different structural and regulatory characteristics .
waiting around for the advanced countries to right their ships so that we can all go back to the old normal is neither good policy nor a good bet .
what is needed is coordinated restructuring and policy setting .
that is hard to do when the us , the largest fiscally unified economy , is focused elsewhere .

why are good policies bad politics ?
berkeley – from the day after the collapse of lehman brothers last year , the policies followed by the united states treasury , the us federal reserve , and the administrations of presidents george w. bush and barack obama have been sound and helpful .
the alternative – standing back and letting the markets handle things – would have brought america and the world higher unemployment than now exists .
credit easing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse .
the fact that investment bankers did not go bankrupt last december and are profiting immensely this year is a side issue .
every extra percentage point of unemployment lasting for two years costs $ 400 billion .
a recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the us roughly $ 2 trillion – and cost the world as a whole four times as much .
in comparison , the bonuses at goldman sachs are a rounding error .
and any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk .
as fed vice chairman don kohn said , ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non-starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of americans – and tens of millions outside the us – at risk .
the obama administration ’ s fiscal stimulus has also significantly helped the economy .
though the jury is still out on the effect of the tax cuts in the stimulus , aid to states has been a job-@@ saving success , and the flow of government spending on a whole variety of relatively useful projects is set to boost production and employment in the same way that consumer spending boosts production and employment .
and the cost of carrying the extra debt incurred is extraordinarily low : $ 12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fiscal-stimulus program at current interest rates .
for that price , american taxpayers will get an extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services , and employment will be higher by about ten million job-@@ years .
the valid complaints about fiscal policy over the past 14 months are not that it has run up the national debt and rewarded the princes of wall street , but rather that it has been too limited – that we ought to have done more .
yet these policies are political losers now : nobody is proposing more stimulus .
this is strange , because usually when something works the natural impulse is to do it again .
good policies that are boosting production and employment without causing inflation ought to be politically popular , right ?
with respect to obama ’ s stimulus package , it seems to me that there has been extraordinary intellectual and political dishonesty on the american right , which the press refuses to see .
for two and a half centuries , economists have believed that the flow of spending in an economy goes up whenever groups of people decide to spend more .
sometimes spending rises because there is more disposable cash in the economy , and sometimes because changes in opportunity costs – the cost of forgoing some other action , such as saving – make people want to spend the cash they have more rapidly .
sometimes and to some degree these increases show up as increases in prices , and sometimes and to some degree as increases in production and employment .
but , whatever the cause or effect , spending always goes up whenever groups decide to spend more – and government decisions to spend more are as good as anybody else ’ s .
they are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new homebuyers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid-2000 ’ s , or of the princes of silicon valley to spend more building new companies during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990 ’ s .
obama ’ s republican opponents , who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work , rely on arguments that are incoherent at best , and usually simply wrong , if not mendacious .
remember that back in 1993 , when the clinton administration ’ s analyses led it to seek to spend less and reduce the deficit , the republicans said that that would destroy the economy , too .
such claims were as wrong then as they are now .
but how many media reports make even a cursory effort to evaluate them ?
a stronger argument , though not by much , is that the fiscal stimulus is boosting employment and production , but at too great a long-run cost because it has produced too large a boost in america &apos;s national debt .
if interest rates on us treasury securities were high and rising rapidly as the debt grew , i would agree with this argument .
but interest rates on us treasury securities are very low and are not rising .
every single treasury auction , at which the market gobbles up huge new tranches of us treasury debt at high prices , belies the argument that the economy has too much debt .
those who claim that america has a debt problem , and that a debt problem cannot be cured with more debt , ignore ( sometimes deliberately ) that private debt and us treasury debt have been very different animals – moving in different directions and behaving in different ways – since the start of the financial crisis .
what the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt , but that it has too much private debt , which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive .
the market is also saying – clearly and repeatedly – that the economy has too little public us government debt , which is why everyone wants to hold it .

why are governments paralyzed ?
milan – it is no secret that the global economy is struggling .
europe is in the midst of a crisis whose root cause is a structurally flawed monetary and economic union .
the united states , emerging slowly from a financial crisis and widespread deleveraging , is experiencing a growth slowdown , a persistent employment problem , an adverse shift in income distribution , and structural challenges , with little effective or decisive policy action .
meanwhile , among the major emerging economies , china ’ s reform process is on hold , pending a leadership transition this fall that will clarify various internal interests ’ goals and power relationships .
india , which has lost reform momentum , is experiencing an economic slowdown and a potential loss of investor confidence .
the negative effects of these problems are now interacting , feeding back on themselves , and spreading to the rest of the global economy .
and yet , despite a palpable sense of concern that something is very wrong , the prognosis for significant change is bleak – and deteriorating .
what accounts for the apparent lack of effective policy action across a broad range of countries and regions ?
one line of thinking blames a “ leadership vacuum ” – a common diagnosis in europe .
elsewhere – especially in the us – polarization and ugly zero-sum politics are thought to discourage potentially capable political leadership .
but , absent further analysis , the leadership vacuum becomes a catchall explanation .
what we need to know is why new political leadership in democracies like france , britain , japan , and the us has produced so little change .
a second explanation addresses that question : while bold action is required , the complexity of economic conditions , and disagreement about the right policy responses , implies a risk of serious error .
on this view , risk aversion both reflects and reinforces a divergence between individual incentives ( the desire to be reelected , reappointed , or promoted ) and collective needs ( fixing problems ) .
a third answer is that policy instruments are simply ineffective in today ’ s conditions .
there is some merit to this claim .
economic deleveraging takes time .
the restoration of sustainable patterns of growth requires years , not months .
expectations may be out of line with the underlying reality .
but the absence of a quick solution does not mean that nothing can be done to improve the speed and quality of recovery .
vested interests may also play a role .
technological innovation and global market forces have produced a decisive shift in income toward capital and the upper 20 % of the income distribution , often at the expense of middle-income groups , the unemployed , and the young .
the beneficiaries of these trends may have accumulated enough political influence to maintain the status quo , highlighting distributional issues that have generally received too little attention in understanding policy responses or their absence .
there are structural explanations for policy inaction as well .
governance systems and constitutional structures differ in the extent to which they require broad consensus for official action , or to change policy direction in response to shocks or shifting conditions .
some argue that the more constraining political systems work well in stable times , but perform poorly under volatile conditions like those prevailing today .
others support constrained government on the grounds that it protects everyone from waste , rent-seeking , and interference with freedom of choice , and that , when needed , inspired leadership can build the required consensus to address changing circumstances .
high hurdles to major shifts in policy direction force officials to make a convincing case .
that is an inherently difficult task at a time when rapid change in the global economy has left many still trying to understand what is happening and what it all means for growth , stability , the distribution of income , and employment .
in the face of such complexity , it is not surprising that genuine policy disagreements lead to extended debate and relatively little action .
moreover , the technocratic elements of government must often be balanced against democratic accountability .
in every society , individuals with special training and expertise are appointed to perform technically complex functions .
their freedom of action is constrained by time limits and reappointment procedures that determine the nature and degree of their accountability to elected officials and the public .
there can be too little freedom of action ( populism ) or too little accountability ( autocracy ) .
the necessary balance may vary according to local conditions .
for example , many china observers believe that accountability there needs to increase at this stage of the country ’ s economic , social , and political evolution .
others argue that western democracies have the opposite problem : a surfeit of narrow , politically assertive interests leads to underinvestment and poor tradeoffs between present and future opportunities and performance .
this brings us to a crucial obstacle : government , business , financial , and academic elites are not trusted .
lack of trust in elites is probably healthy at some level , but numerous polls indicate that it is in rapid decline , which surely increases citizens ’ reluctance to delegate authority to navigate an uncertain global economic environment .
loss of trust probably has multiple causes , including analytical failure : central banks , regulators , market participants , rating agencies , and economists almost all failed to detect rising systemic risk in the years preceding the current crisis , much less to take appropriate corrective action .
but a more important cause is a suspicion that elites are placing their own interests above shared social values .
claims that our leadership , institutions , analyses , or policy instruments are inadequate to the task at hand surely contain a kernel of truth .
but the deeper problem is a breakdown in precisely such values and goals – that is , a weakening of social cohesion .
restoring it will require analysts , policymakers , business leaders , and civil-society groups to clarify causes , share blame for mistakes , pursue flexible solutions in which costs are shared equitably , and , most important , explain that hard problems cannot be solved overnight .

cambridge – as policymakers and investors continue to fret over the risks posed by today ’ s ultra-low global interest rates , academic economists continue to debate the underlying causes . by now , everyone accepts some version of us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke ’ s statement in 2005 that a “ global savings glut ” is at the root of the problem .
but economists disagree on why we have the glut , how long it will last , and , most fundamentally , on whether it is a good thing .
bernanke ’ s original speech emphasized several factors – some that decreased the demand for global savings , and some that increased supply .
either way , interest rates would have to fall in order for world bond markets to clear .
he pointed to how the asian financial crisis in the late 1990 ’ s caused the region ’ s voracious investment demand to collapse , while simultaneously inducing asian governments to stockpile liquid assets as a hedge against another crisis . bernanke also pointed to increased retirement saving by aging populations in germany and japan , as well as to saving by oil-exporting countries , with their rapidly growing populations and concerns about oil revenues in the long term .
monetary policy , incidentally , did not feature prominently in bernanke ’ s diagnosis .
like most economists , he believes that if policymakers try to keep interest rates at artificially low levels for too long , eventually demand will soar and inflation will jump .
so , if inflation is low and stable , central banks cannot be blamed for low long-term rates .
in fact , i strongly suspect that if one polled investors , monetary policy would be at the top of the list , not absent from it , as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates .
the fact that so many investors hold this view ought to make one think twice before absolving monetary policy of all responsibility .
nevertheless , i share bernanke ’ s instinct that , while central banks do set very short-term interest rates , they have virtually no influence over long-term real ( inflation-adjusted ) rates , other than a modest effect through portfolio management policies ( for example , “ quantitative easing ” ) .
a lot has changed since 2005 .
we had the financial crisis , and some of the factors cited by bernanke have substantially reversed .
for example , asian investment is booming again , led by china .
and yet global interest rates are even lower now than they were then .
why ?
there are several competing theories , most of them quite elegant , but none of them entirely satisfactory .
one view holds that long-term growth risks have been on the rise , raising the premium on assets that are perceived to be relatively safe , and raising precautionary saving in general .
( of course , no one should think that any government bonds are completely safe , particularly from inflation and financial repression . )
certainly , the 2008 financial crisis should have been a wakeup call to proponents of the “ great moderation ” view that long-term volatility has fallen .
many studies suggest that it is becoming more difficult than ever to anchor expectations about long-term growth trends .
witness , for example , the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or decelerating .
shifting geopolitical power also breeds uncertainty .
another class of academic theories follows bernanke ( and , even earlier , michael dooley , david folkerts-landau , and peter garber ) in attributing low long-term interest rates to the growing importance of emerging economies , but with the major emphasis on private savings rather than public savings .
because emerging economies have relatively weak asset markets , their citizens seek safe haven in advanced-country government bonds .
a related theory is that emerging economies ’ citizens find it difficult to diversify the huge risk inherent in their fast-growing but volatile environments , and feel particularly vulnerable as a result of weak social safety nets .
so they save massively .
these explanations have some merit , but one should recognize that central banks and sovereign wealth funds , not private citizens , are the players most directly responsible for the big savings surpluses .
it is a strain to think that governments have the same motivations as private citizens .
besides , on closer inspection , the emerging-market explanation , though convenient , is not quite as compelling as it might seem .
emerging economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries , which neoclassical growth models suggest should push global interest rates up , not down .
similarly , the integration of emerging-market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor .
according to standard trade theory , a global labor glut ought to imply an increased rate of return on capital , which again pushes interest rates up , not down .
surely , any explanation must include the global constri@@ ction of credit , especially for small and medium-size businesses .
tighter regulation of lending standards has shut out an important source of global investment demand , putting downward pressure on interest rates .
my best guess is that when global uncertainty fades and global growth picks up , global interest rates will start to rise , too .
but predicting the timing of this transition is difficult .
the puzzle of the global savings glut may live on for several years to come .

austerity and demoralization
new haven – the high unemployment that we have today in europe , the united states , and elsewhere is a tragedy , not just because of the aggregate output loss that it entails , but also because of the personal and emotional cost to the unemployed of not being a part of working society .
british prime minister david cameron , an austerity advocate , says he believes that his program reduces “ welfare dependency , ” restores “ rigor , ” and encourages the “ the doers , the creators , the life-@@ affirm@@ ers . ”
likewise , us congressman paul ryan says that his program is part of a plan to promote “ creativity and entrepreneurial spirit . ”
some kinds of austerity programs may indeed boost morale .
monks find their life ’ s meaning in a most austere environment , and military boot camps are thought to build character .
but the kind of fiscal austerity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people jobless and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of rejection and exclusion .
one could imagine that a spell of unemployment might be a time of reflection , reestablishment of personal connections , and getting back to fundamental values .
some economists even thought long ago that we would be enjoying much more leisure by this point .
john maynard keynes , in his 1930 essay “ economic possibilities for our grandchildren , ” speculated that , within a hundred years , that is , by 2030 , higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours , for a total workweek of only 15 hours .
while there are still 17 years to go , it appears that keynes was way off the mark .
so was robert theobald , who , in his 1963 book free men and free markets questioned the public ’ s repugnance toward high unemployment .
he asserted that “ we can have meaningful leisure rather than destructive unemployment , ” and that we do not need “ a whir@@ ling-@@ dervish economy dependent on compulsive consumption . ”
but finding something satisfying to do with our time seems inevitably to entail doing some sort of work : “ meaningful leisure ” wears thin after a while .
people seem to want to work more than three hours a day , even if it is assembly-line work .
and the opportunity to work should be a basic freedom .
unemployment is a product of capitalism : people who are no longer needed are simply made redundant .
on the traditional family farm , there was no unemployment .
austerity exposes the modern economy ’ s lack of interpersonal connectedness and the morale costs that this implies .
work-sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump , thereby preserving their self-esteem .
instead of laying off 25 % of its workforce in a recession , a company could temporarily reduce workers ’ hours from , say , eight per day to six .
everyone would remain employed , and all would come a little closer to keynes ’ s ideal .
some countries , notably germany , have encouraged this approach .
but work-sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing .
these problems preclude the sudden movement toward the ideal of greater leisure that thinkers like keynes and theobald proclaimed .
one problem is that workers have fixed costs , such as transportation to work or a health plan , that do not decline when hours ( and thus pay ) are cut .
their debts and obligations are similarly fixed .
they could have bought a smaller house had they known that their hours would be reduced , but now it is difficult to downsize the one that they did buy .
another problem is that it may be difficult to reduce everyone ’ s job by the same amount , because some jobs scale up and down with production , while others do not .
in his book why wages don ’ t fall during a recession , truman bewley of yale university reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs .
he found that they believed that a serious morale problem would result from reducing everyone ’ s hours and pay during a recession .
then all employees would begin to feel as if they did not have a real job .
in his interviews with managers , he was told that it is best ( at least from a manager ’ s point of view ) if the pain of reduced employment is concentrated on a few people , whose grumbling is not heard by the remaining employees .
employers worry about workplace morale , not about the morale of the employees they lay off .
their damaged morale certainly affects others as a sort of externality , which matters very much ; but it does not matter to the firm that has laid them off .
we could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress .
but we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis .
that is why sudden austerity cannot be a morale builder .
for morale , we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone , a way to show oneself to be part of society by being a worker of some sort .
and for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally , the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally .
the increased tax burden for all who are employed is analogous to the reduced hours in work-sharing .
but , if tax increases are not politically expedient , policymakers should proceed with old-fashioned deficit spending .
the important thing is to achieve any fiscal stimulus that boosts job creation and puts the unemployed back to work .

end austerity now
edinburgh – in recent weeks , talk about a budding recovery in the eurozone has gained traction , with key indices pointing to expansion in the core countries – data that many are citing as evidence that austerity is finally working .
money-market funds from the united states are returning , albeit cautiously , to resume funding of european bank debt .
even goldman sachs is now bullishly piling into european equities .
but is a recovery really underway ?
cynics recall that a european recovery was supposed to take hold as early as the fourth quarter of 2010 , and that every international monetary fund projection since then has predicted recovery “ by the end of the year . ”
instead , gdp has collapsed , with the spanish and italian economies expected to contract by close to 2 % this year .
portugal ’ s economy is set to shrink by more than 2 % , and greece ’ s output will fall by more than 4 % .
moreover , unemployment in the eurozone has skyrocketed to an average rate of roughly 12 % , with more than 50 % youth unemployment in the periphery countries implying a long-term loss of talent and erosion of the tax base .
and , despite the spike in unemployment , productivity growth in the eurozone is decidedly negative .
more significant , over the last year , the public debt / gdp ratio rose by seven percentage points in italy , 11 in ireland , and 15 in portugal and spain .
if the sine qua non of recovery via austerity is the stabilization and reduction of debt , the cynics ’ case appears to have been made .
against this background , the return of us investors to provide short-term dollar funding for european bank debt smacks of a desperate hunt for yield that relies on european central bank president mario draghi ’ s promise to do “ whatever it takes ” to save the euro .
as for goldman ’ s equity play , as bond-market guru bill blain put it , “ the words ‘ buy cheap , sell a bit dearer on the up , and then dump and run ’ spring to mind . ”
in fact , any talk of recovery is premature until the losses incurred by austerity are recouped .
as it stands , every country that has implemented an austerity program without imposing losses on private creditors has more debt now than when it started .
for example , according to official estimates , spain ’ s public debt , which amounted to only about 36 % of gdp when the crisis began , has almost tripled – and the actual figure may be much higher .
more telling , the countries that cut expenditure the most experienced the largest bond-@@ yield spikes and the most significant debt growth .
the explanation for this is simple . when a country gives up its monetary sovereignty , its banks are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency , making them exceptionally vulnerable to liquidity shocks , like that which sparked turmoil in europe ’ s banking system in 2010-2011 .
the government , unable to print money to bail out the banks or increase export competitiveness through currency devaluation , is left with only two options : default or deflation ( austerity ) .
austerity ’ s underlying logic is that budget cuts , by reducing the debt burden and restoring confidence , ultimately enhance stability and support growth .
but , when countries pursue austerity simultaneously with their main trading partners , overall demand plummets , causing all of their economies to contract and , in turn , increasing their debt / gdp ratios .
but the problem with austerity in the eurozone is more fundamental : policymakers are attempting to address a sovereign-debt crisis , though the real problem is a banking crisis .
with europe ’ s banking system triple the size and twice as leveraged as its us counterpart , and the ecb lacking genuine lender-of-last-resort authority , the sudden halt in capital flows to peripheral countries in 2009 created a liquidity-starved system that was too big to bail out .
as holders of euro-denominated assets recognized this situation , they turned to the ecb for insurance ( which the ecb could not deliver under its previous president , jean-claude trichet , whose leadership was defined by his commitment to maintaining price stability ) .
investors ’ subsequent efforts to price in the risk of a eurozone breakup – not the volume of sovereign debt – caused bond yields to spike .
but the financial-market turmoil fueled a panic among eurozone leaders , leading them to misdiagnose the malady and prescribe the wrong medicine , which has served only to generate new symptoms .
while draghi ’ s promise , embodied by the ecb ’ s “ outright monetary transactions ” program – as well as its long-term refinancing operation and emergency liquidity assistance program – has bought time and lowered yields , the eurozone ’ s banking crisis persists .
eurozone leaders must recognize that spending cuts will do nothing to stabilize the balance sheets of core-country banks that are over-exposed to peripheral countries ’ sovereign debt .
until europe rejects austerity in favor of a growth-oriented approach , all signs of recovery will prove illusory .

why bannon had to go
washington , dc – in many , if not most , us administrations , some figure emerges who convinces the press that the president couldn ’ t function without him ( it ’ s yet to be a her ) .
the indispensable aide is , indeed , one of the most well-worn tropes of the modern presidency .
karl rove was “ bush ’ s brain ” ; harry hopkins held franklin delano roosevelt ’ s prolific white house team together ; bill moyers appeared on a magazine cover as “ johnson ’ s good angel . ”
without such a figure , the story inevitably goes , the administration would be a mess , if not a disaster .
as often as not , the trope is invented or encouraged by the particular indispensable figure .
journalists usually fall for the story , regardless of how well-founded it is : it clarifies everything , and it gives them something to write about .
the indispensable aide is only too happy to reveal some dramatic story about how he saved the day , devised some particularly ingenious idea , or prevented some terrible mistake .
but , as often as not , the soi-disant crucial figure oversteps .
in the reagan white house , don regan , who succeeded james baker as chief of staff , fancied himself the prime minister : he inserted himself into photos of reagan with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , was rude to lesser beings ( including reporters ) , and made the fatal mistake of hanging up on nancy reagan , who was dedicated to looking after her ronny .
regan was soon out .
presidents themselves aren ’ t particularly fond of reading how some super-smart aide saved their bacon .
all presidents have healthy egos – if others are so smart , why aren ’ t they president ?
the wise president-elect identifies a peacock and avoids the species from the start , or knows how to keep its feathers in check .
barack obama was plenty pleased with himself , with reason , but such was his dignity that no super-@@ aide emerged during his presidency .
it didn ’ t occur to his advisers to try to outshine him .
stephen bannon wasn ’ t particularly wise as a white house aide – he couldn ’ t contain his inner peacock – and donald trump ’ s ego is particularly fragile .
both are or were misfits in their roles .
trump had spent his business life surrounded by family and flun@@ kies : no stockholders or vice chairmen with their own ambitions .
the two men were a mismatch made in white house hell .
as a candidate , trump went with his instincts , and his instinct in the 2016 presidential race was that blue-collar workers and others who feared for their economic future needed their own victims , be they mexican immigrants or billionaire bankers .
a wall – phantasmagori@@ cal or not – would keep out the “ bad people ” mexico was “ sending us . ” as it happened , of all the people around trump , bannon most matched these views .
a person like bannon – who presents himself as a learned figure and confirms one ’ s own brilliance – is a person one wants to have close by .
once elected , he brought in billionaires to populate his cabinet , and so far seems to have gotten away with telling his supporters that really rich people are needed to run the country .
bannon , on the other hand , wrapped himself in what might be loosely termed a philosophy , which consisted of a nihilistic anger toward any “ establishment . ”
but his was faux populism : while bannon politically championed blue-collar workers , he lived on the millions he had attained from a stint at goldman sachs and through a fortunate investment in the tv comedy series “ seinfeld . ”
he also flourished with backing from the billionaire mercer family .
the mercers , who made their fortune through the high-tech genius of patriarch robert mercer and a hedge fund he led , fund breitbart news , a far-right website formerly edited by bannon that promotes ultra-nationalism and white supremacy , with a whiff of anti-semitism .
bannon ’ s ostensibly radical views were dressed up in a fancy set of principles embro@@ i@@ dered with name-@@ drops of far-@@ out thinkers .
in trade and immigration , for example , bannon ’ s acquired philosophy aligned with trump ’ s political opportunism ( trump ’ s more liberal , often democrat-@@ backing former self is another story ) .
it was a mistake to see bannon as pygmalion to trump ’ s galatea , or , as some did , as the trump white house ’ s rasputin .
bannon reinforced the nationalist inclination that led trump to overrule his daughter ivanka and his economic advisers by withdrawing from the paris climate agreement .
and bannon intruded on foreign policy by getting himself put on the national security council for a while , until two of the generals in trump ’ s administration – national security adviser h. r. mcmaster and john kelly ( now the chief of staff ) – got him removed .
( bannon was believed to be behind the recent push to force out mcmaster , mainly by suggesting that he is “ anti-israel . ” )
but bannon ’ s role as geni@@ us-@@ witho@@ ut-@@ portfolio – in which trump indulged him , until kelly arrived and clarified chains of command – was his undoing .
without any defined responsibilities , he intruded where he wished – and ended up with a lot of enemies .
he had plenty of time to fight internal battles by feeding reporters stories about his white house rivals , though he would switch someone ( for example , former chief of staff reince priebus ) from rival to friend , as convenient .
bannon was a troublemaker as much as a policymaker – and the two roles didn ’ t mesh .
trump also began to see bannon as a “ leak@@ er . ”
and trump ’ s white house is all too leaky : many who work there let reporters know that they have , at best , mixed feelings about working for trump , but believe the better part of valor is to stay and protect the country from his leadership .
bannon ’ s braggadocio took him to the most dangerous terrain on which to confront trump : the president ’ s obsession with his election victory .
the ambiguity of winning the electoral college vote ( not , as he has falsely claimed , by the greatest margin since reagan ) but losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes , dogs trump .
that ’ s why he invented millions of “ illegal ” voters and had maps printed showing the states he won in red – covering most of the territory of the united states – even suggesting to at least one reporter that his newspaper run the map on the paper ’ s front page .
suggestions by bannon that he played a major role in trump ’ s election victory were poisonous to the relationship between the two men .
and so this white house mis@@ fit finally had to go .
now that bannon is gone , however , he will hurl missives from his new-old perch at breitbart , to which he returned the same day as his announced departure .
and trump will still be trump .

why barack obama ?
new york – the winner of america ’ s presidential election will inherit a perfect storm of problems , both economic and international .
he will face the most difficult opening-@@ day agenda of any president since – and i say this in all seriousness – the man who saved the union , abraham lincoln .
but a more instructive precedent is 1933 , when franklin roosevelt offered inspiring rhetoric and “ bold experimentation ” to a nation facing economic meltdown and a breakdown in public confidence .
for me , the choice is simple – and not only because i am , by temperament and history , a democrat .
the long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates ’ positions , style , and personal qualities .
and the conclusion seems clear .
judgment .
john mccain has shown throughout his career a penchant for risk-taking ; in his memoirs , he proudly calls himself a gambler .
his selection of sarah palin , a charismatic but spectacularly unqualified candidate , as his running mate , is just the most glaring of many examples of the real mccain .
his bravery in combat attests to his patriotism , courage , and toughness , but his judgment has been found sorely lacking time and time again over his career .
barack obama is tough , too , but in a different way .
no one should underestimate how difficult it was to travel his road , against incredible odds , to the cusp of the presidency .
but where mccain is impulsive and emotional , obama is low-key and unemotional .
he makes his judgments in a calm and methodical manner ; mccain ’ s impulsiveness is anathema to obama , and rightly so – one cannot play cra@@ ps with history .
having seen so many political leaders falter under pressure , i prize this ability above most others .
and barack obama has it .
the economy .
the first priority of the new president will be the economy and the financial crisis .
since the crisis hit , obama has been calm and , indeed , presidential .
he consulted the best advisory team in the nation , weighed each course of action carefully , and then issued a series of precise , calm statements .
meanwhile , mccain has veered bizarrely , issuing contradictory statements , “ suspending ” his campaign ( while continuing to campaign ) , and urging that the first debate be canceled ( when it was all the more needed ) .
advantage obama .
foreign policy .
the most explicit disagreements between the candidates are over iraq , iran , and russia .
but there are deeper differences .
mccain ’ s positions , with the notable exception of climate change , suggest that he would simply try to carry out george w. bush ’ s policies more effectively .
obama offers a different approach to foreign policy .
by starting to draw down combat troops in iraq , obama would change the image and policies of america immediately .
by engaging iran in talks that would cover not only the nuclear issue but other aspects of iran ’ s destabilizing role in the region , he would either reach agreements that lowered the dangers from iran , or he would mobilize a stronger international coalition to isolate iran .
either way , engaging iran is the right policy , and it is hard to understand why bush and mccain have continued to hold out against such an obvious change of course , which , if carried out with firmness , will not compromise american or israeli national security .
on russia since its invasion of georgia , obama and his running mate , joe biden ( who was the first member of congress to visit georgia after the invasion ) , emphasize helping georgia rebuild its economy and maintain its independence in the face of a continuing russian campaign against it .
mccain , on the other hand , wants to punish russia by such actions as expelling it from the g-8 .
such measures may ultimately be necessary , but they will not help georgia survive as an independent democracy .
moreover , even after the outrage in georgia , there are issues of common interest – such as energy , climate change , and iran – on which the west and the kremlin must cooperate .
this was true even during the cold war , and remains true today , yet mccain seems not to recognize it .
leadership .
in the end , all presidential elections come down to the intangibles of leadership .
the vote for a president is a sort of private contract directly between each voter and his or her preferred choice .
who do you want to see on your television screen for the next four years ?
here again , the contrasting styles of obama and mccain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one , between a major change in the nation ’ s direction and a minor one , between a conciliatory style and a more combative one .
effectiveness .
finally , in a year in which the democrats are certain to increase their majority in both houses of congress , an obama victory would offer the democrats control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1994 , and with it the possibility of legislative achievement after years of stalemate .
after so many years of polarization at home and unilateralism abroad , the choice for president seems clear .

why bipartisanship is good politics
london – bipartisanship seems to have taken a drubbing in washington since president barack obama got to the white house .
like most recent american presidents , obama campaigned on a promise to work with his political opponents for the greater good of the country .
bill clinton said much the same thing before he was elected , and then spent his first term in a knockdown fight with newt gingrich ’ s republican majority in congress , and his second term fighting off impeachment .
george w. bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him .
he then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times , egged on by his vice-president , dick cheney .
obama already appears to have gone further in the pursuit of bipartisanship than his predecessors .
his selection of republicans for key posts – including retaining robert gates as secretary of defense – has raised a few eyebrows among his supporters .
but , above all , he has tried hard to secure republican support for his efforts to prevent the economy from disappearing into a deep recessionary hole .
only three maverick republican senators went along with obama ’ s proposals to get the plan accepted .
and in the house of representatives , the republicans unanimously rejected every amendment , every compromise , and every courtesy that he offered .
some commentators suggest that obama made a bad mistake .
first , he promised bipartisanship , but got heavily rebuffed .
second , he and his administration were so busy trying to build consensus that they watered down some of the vital ingredients of the stimulus package , and failed to defend it robustly from republican attack .
there may sometimes be a downside in trying to woo your opponents .
when they are plainly wrong , why let them off the hook ?
here we have had republicans criticizing an increase in america ’ s budget deficit after doubling america ’ s national debt in the bush presidency ’ s eight years .
moreover , republicans ’ belief that only tax cuts , not public spending , will delivery recovery is a sad example of blinkered ideology .
but there are more positive reasons for obama effort at bipartisanship .
in any democratic system of checks and balances , leaders usually require coalitions in order to get what they want done .
moreover , a consensual style is good politics .
most voters – certainly swing voters , who usually decide elections – do not like partisan battles as much as some politicians and their supporters do .
after all , the wise , the moderate , and the floating voter do not switch on the radio to listen to arch@@ conservatives like the american broadcaster rush limbaugh .
when things get tough in politics , as will happen in most of the world as we struggle with the impact of the global recession , every sensible government will try to hang on to the benefit of doubt .
it is the most important attribute in politics .
citizens know that running a country , especially in a time like this , is tough .
they are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism , if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone .
they brid@@ le at a government that must do unpopular things and that also looks narrow and mean-spirited .
there is also a lot to be said for making political argument more civil .
ronald reagan had a strong ideological bent .
he reshaped american politics , pulling the center firmly to the right .
but he did so without ever seeming to despise his opponents or disparage their intentions .
obama ’ s aides have confessed that he modeled his own election program on the sunny and optimistic decency of the republican actor .
civility in politics is not simply political confec@@ tion@@ ery .
a leader who respects his or her opponents is more likely to earn respect himself than one who doubts their patriotism and resents their criticism .
one reason for the widespread respect felt for nelson mandela is that years of imprisonment did not em@@ bitter him .
jawaharlal nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech , take seriously the views of his critics , and defend their right to disagree with him .
his role in establishing enduring democracy in india , despite the tensions of caste , ethnicity , religion , and regional loyalties , made him one of the towering figures of the twentieth century .
so my own hope is that obama will not be dissuaded from trying to work with his opponents , to build consensus , and to deal courte@@ ously even with those whose views he may thoroughly dislike .
personally , i do not think that those whose philosophy deplores the whole idea of government , except when it is required to bail out businesses or banks , and who purport to offer a better future by stitching together the shreds and tatters of policies that helped produce today ’ s economic disaster , will have much respect or support from voters .
even in washington , there is not much to be said for being partisan , unpopular , and wrong .

new york – the financial-services industry has been undergoing a revolution .
but the driving force is not overhyped blockchain applications such as bitcoin .
it is a revolution built on artificial intelligence , big data , and the internet of things .
already , thousands of real businesses are using these technologies to disrupt every aspect of financial intermediation .
dozens of online-payment services – paypal , alipay , wechat pay , venmo , and so forth – have hundreds of millions of daily users .
and financial institutions are making precise lending decisions in seconds rather than weeks , thanks to a wealth of online data on individuals and firms .
with time , such data-driven improvements in credit allocation could even eliminate cyclical credit-driven booms and busts .
similarly , insurance underwriting , claims assessment and management , and fraud monitoring have all become faster and more precise .
and actively managed portfolios are increasingly being replaced by passive robo-@@ advisers , which can perform just as well or better than conflicted , high-@@ fee financial advisers .
now , compare this real and ongoing fintech revolution with the record of blockchain , which has existed for almost a decade , and still has only one application : cryptocurrencies .
blockchain ’ s boosters would argue that its early days resemble the early days of the internet , before it had commercial applications .
but that comparison is simply false .
whereas the internet quickly gave rise to email , the world wide web , and millions of viable commercial ventures used by billions of people , cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin do not even fulfill their own stated purpose .
it is none of those things .
no one prices anything in bitcoin .
few retailers accept it .
and it is a poor store of value , because its price can fluctuate by 20-30 % in a single day .
worse , cryptocurrencies in general are based on a false premise .
according to its promoters , bitcoin has a steady-state supply of 21 million units , so it cannot be debased like fiat currencies .
but that claim is clearly fraudulent , considering that it has already for@@ ked off into three branches : bitcoin cash , litecoin , and bitcoin gold .
besides , hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are invented every day , alongside scams known as “ initial coin offerings , ” which are mostly designed to skirt securities laws .
so “ stable ” cryp@@ tos are creating money supply and debasing it at a much faster pace than any major central bank ever has .
as is typical of a financial bubble , investors are buying cryptocurrencies not to use in transactions , but because they expect them to increase in value .
indeed , if someone actually wanted to use bitcoin , they would have a hard time doing so .
it is so energy-intensive ( and thus environmentally toxic ) to produce , and carries such high transaction costs , that even bitcoin conferences do not accept it as a valid form of payment .
until now , bitcoin ’ s only real use has been to facilitate illegal activities such as drug transactions , tax evasion , avoidance of capital controls , or money laundering .
not surprisingly , g20 member states are now working together to regulate cryptocurrencies and eliminate the anonymity they supposedly afford , by requiring that all income- or capital-@@ gains-@@ generating transactions be reported .
after a crackdown by asian regulators this month , cryptocurrency values fell by 50 % from their december peak .
they would have collapsed much more had a vast scheme to prop up their price via outright manipulation not been rapidly implemented .
but , like in the case of the sub-prime bubble , most us regulators are still asleep at the wheel .
since the invention of money thousands of years ago , there has never been a monetary system with hundreds of different currencies operating alongside one another .
the entire point of money is that it allows parties to transact without having to barter .
but for money to have value , and to generate economies of scale , only so many currencies can operate at the same time .
in the us , the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars is obvious : doing so would be pointless , and it would make the economy far less efficient .
the idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies could vi@@ ably operate together not only contradicts the very concept of money ; it is utterly idiotic .
but so , too , is the idea that even a single cryptocurrency could substitute for fiat money .
cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value , whereas fiat currencies certainly do , because they can be used to pay taxes .
fiat currencies are also protected from value debasement by central banks committed to price stability ; and if a fiat currency loses credibility , as in some weak monetary systems with high inflation , it will be swapped out for more stable foreign fiat currencies or real assets .
as it happens , bitcoin ’ s supposed advantage is also its achilles ’ s heel , because even if it actually did have a steady-state supply of 21 million units , that would disqualify it as a viable currency .
unless the supply of a currency tracks potential nominal gdp , prices will undergo deflation .
that means if a steady-state supply of bitcoin really did gradually replace a fiat currency , the price index of all goods and services would continuously fall .
by extension , any nominal debt contract denominated in bitcoin would rise in real value over time , leading to the kind of debt deflation that economist irving fisher believed precipitated the great depression .
at the same time , nominal wages in bitcoin would increase forever in real terms , regardless of productivity growth , adding further to the likelihood of an economic disaster .
clearly , bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent the mother of all bubbles , which explains why every human being i met between thanksgiving and christmas of 2017 asked me if they should buy them .
scam@@ mers , swindlers , charlatans , and carnival bar@@ kers ( all conflicted insiders ) have tapped into clueless retail investors ’ fomo ( “ fear of missing out ” ) , and taken them for a ride .
as for the underlying blockchain technology , there are still massive obstacles standing in its way , even if it has more potential than cryptocurrencies .
chief among them is that it lacks the kind of basic common and universal protocols that made the internet universally accessible ( tcp-ip , html , and so forth ) .
more fundamentally , its promise of decentralized transactions with no intermediary authority amounts to an untested , utopian pipedream .
no wonder blockchain is ranked close to the peak of the hype cycle of technologies with inflated expectations .
so , forget about blockchain , bitcoin , and other cryptocurrencies , and start investing in fintech firms with actual business models , which are slogging away to revolutionize the financial-services industry .
you won ’ t get rich overnight ; but you ’ ll have made the smarter investment .

did the bankers do it ?
new delhi – few areas of economic activity in the united states are more politicized than housing finance .
yet the intellectual left has gone to great lengths to absolve regulators , government lending mandates , and agencies like fannie mae and freddie mac of any responsibility for the housing boom and the subsequent bust .
the rationale is clear : if these officials , institutions , and policies were held accountable , the reform agenda would necessarily shift from regulating greedy bankers and their bonuses to asking broader questions .
might government mandates contribute to bad behavior by private players ?
can regulators be trusted to make appropriate trade-offs between financial stability and mandates that have wide political support ?
indeed , can central bankers be truly independent ?
unquestioning acceptance of a greater government role in taming markets would , in short , give way to asking whether that role can sometimes be part of the problem .
the left has had an easy task in dominating the debate , partly because the intellectual right ’ s attempt to place all the blame for the crisis on government is thoroughly implausible .
it is far more defensible and correct to argue that everyone – bankers , households , regulators , and politicians – contributed to ( and took credit for ) the boom while it lasted , only to point fingers at one another when it collapsed .
but bankers ’ political tin ear in the aftermath of the crisis – first taking public bailouts and then paying themselves huge bonuses as if nothing had changed – ensured that they got the lion ’ s share of the blame , with everyone else willing to pose as their unwitting victims .
as a result , the public-policy response has been dominated by “ the bankers did it ” narrative .
the risk is that this approach is incomplete – and thus unlikely to be effective .
it is therefore refreshing to see a careful econometric study take on an assertion by paul krugman , perhaps the most influential left-leaning us economist , that “ the community reinvestment act of 1977 was irrelevant to the subprime boom . ”
the cra instructs federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage the institutions that they regulate to help the communities in which they are chartered to meet their credit needs , while also conforming to “ safe and sound ” standards .
in practice , regulators measure the volume of lending to cra target tracts – poor areas with median income less than 80 % of the median income of the local community – as well as to low-income and minority borrowers in non-@@ cra tracts to verify compliance with the act .
the left has dismissed any claim that the cra played a role in the housing boom by pointing out that it was enacted in 1977 , while the subprime boom played out in the early 2000 ’ s .
but this ignores the possibility that regulators may have started to enforce the cra rigorously only later .
to enforce the statute , regulators periodically examine banks for cra compliance .
to hone in on the “ regulatory enforcement ” effect , the recent study compares the behavior of banks that are undergoing examination ( which takes place over several quarters ) to that of banks that are not undergoing examination in a particular tract in a particular month .
the findings are clear .
compared to banks that are not undergoing examination , the volume of loans by banks in the six quarters surrounding a cra examination is 5 % higher , and these loans are 15 % more likely to be delinquent one year after origination .
in other words , banks undergoing examination lend more and make riskier loans – and these findings are even more pronounced in cra-@@ eligible tracts .
good econometric studies examine secondary effects to persuade readers that the main effect is what it is .
regulators ’ primary tool to enforce compliance was their authority to reject non-@@ cra-compliant banks ’ requests for new branches or mergers .
during the subprime boom , large banks were more likely to want to expand , and thus had greater incentive to comply .
the study finds that cra lending by larger banks does indeed respond more to a cra examination .
at the height of the lending frenzy ( 2004-2006 ) , the study finds that banks loaned even more in response to an examination , and that the outcomes were even worse .
the authors speculate that easier loan securitization may have made risky cra-compliant loans seem less costly .
finally , like all good studies , this one explains why the authors more careful analysis produces results that differ from those in previous studies .
because of the way it is structured , the study only suggests a lower bound on the effects of cra compliance .
it focuses on the differential impact of the cra on banks undergoing examination and those not undergoing examination .
in fact , all banks are likely to have upped their cra-compliant lending .
the study cannot measure this increase .
there is room in economics for grand speculation – some part intuition , some part common sense , and some part ideology .
if economists were to wait for careful studies before offering opinions about policy , we would never have anything timely to say .
and it is certainly better to have some economic intuition guiding policy than none at all .
but there is a danger that the public mistakes speculation for truth , only because of the speculator ’ s credentials and assertiveness .
studies like this one are useful in setting the record straight .
we must recognize that in the desire to broaden home ownership , essential checks and balances broke down .
households , politicians , and regulators were also complicit .
as we go about the process of reform , we should bear in mind that the only thing worse than fighting the last war is fighting the wrong last war .

why border walls fail
honolulu – call this the year of border walls .
in 2015 , estonia , hungary , kenya , saudi arabia , and tunisia all announced or began the construction of barriers on their frontiers .
we may live in an era of globalization , but much of the world is increasingly focused on limiting the free movement of people .
at the end of world war ii , there were only five border walls around the world .
today , according to elisabeth vallet of the university of quebec at montreal , there are 65 , three-quarters of them built in the past 20 years .
and in the united states , republican presidential candidates are promising more .
the republican frontrunner , donald trump , has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with mexico .
and on a sunday morning talk show , another republican candidate , wisconsin governor scott walker , described building a wall on the us-canada border as “ a legitimate issue for us to look at . ”
and yet existing border walls are neither cheap nor effective .
israel ’ s wall in the west bank cost more than $ 1 million per mile to construct .
according to us customs and border protection , building and maintaining the existing 670 miles of border fencing on the us-mexico border would cost $ 6.5 billion over the barrier ’ s expected 20-year life cycle .
at this price , fortifying the remaining 1,300 miles of the mexico border would cost more than $ 12.6 billion .
erecting a wall along the 5,5@@ 25-@@ mile border with canada would cost almost $ 50 billion and would cut through an airport runway , an opera house , homes , and businesses that currently straddle the border .
nor is there much evidence that border walls work as intended .
to be sure , prisons demonstrate that short , well-guarded walls can be extremely effective at preventing movement .
but even prison walls are only as effective as the guards who ensure that they are not breached , and guards can be susceptible to bribes .
the recent escape of the drug cartel leader joaquin “ el chapo ” guzman from a mexican prison highlights another vulnerability of border walls : tunnels .
since 1990 , the us border patrol has found 150 tunnels beneath the us-mexico border .
those with money will always be able to cross borders using fake documents , bribes , or innovative infrastructure .
indeed , fortified frontiers are most effective at stopping poor migrants and refugees .
and even then , rather than preventing migrants from entering , fortifications all too often funnel them toward more dangerous crossing points .
the result is a mounting toll of predictable deaths .
the international organization for migration estimates that from 2005 to 2014 , some 40,000 people died attempting to cross a border .
unlike prison perimeters , borders can be thousands of miles long , which makes them difficult to monitor properly .
the us employs more than 20,000 border patrol agents ; but even if they were all on duty at the same time , each would need to guard a 1,@@ 700-@@ foot section of the border .
of course , equipment like cameras , motion sensors , drones , helicopters , and vehicles allow agents to watch long sections of the border .
but the necessity of monitoring border walls points to one of the fundamental truths about them : historically , most have proved to be pretty useless .
the most famous sections of the great wall of china were overrun within a few decades of their construction .
when germany invaded france in wwii , it simply went around the maginot line .
the berlin wall fell within 30 years of its construction .
indeed , border guards and their equipment can be equally effective without a physical barrier .
at best , walls and fences only slow people down , making them a poor investment from a security standpoint .
they are similarly ineffective from a military perspective .
missiles and airplanes can fly over them and tanks can smash through them .
and yet , despite their high cost and low efficacy , walls remain popular among policymakers and politicians .
they provide im@@ po@@ singly tangible evidence that something is being done about migration .
high-tech surveillance and boots on the ground may be more effective at preventing people from crossing a border , but a wall can be used as a political prop .
if trump ever builds his wall , he should build a really nice one , like the great wall of china .
then one day it might become a popular tourist attraction – and finally serve a useful purpose .

paris – who would have thought it ?
there they were , brazilians , protesting outside football stadiums against their country hosting the world cup in 2014 – and this even as their national team was thra@@ shing spain in the final of the confederations cup .
it was as if catholics were to protest outside the vatican against picking a new pope .
what cuisine is to the french , soccer is to brazilians : a matter of the highest national pride .
regardless of their economic , racial , or political differences , all brazilians are up@@ lifted by having the best team in the world , winning the world cup many times , and inventing and reinventing “ the beautiful game . ”
staging the next world cup in brazil , as well as the olympic games in 2016 , even though the football tournament alone will cost up to $ 13 billion , seems a logical move .
so what possessed the 19-year-old brazilian male who told reporters : “ we don ’ t need the world cup .
we need education , better health services , more humane police . ” many people feel the same way .
have millions of brazilians suddenly lost their passion for the game ?
if so , it is not the game itself that they have forsaken , but rather the kind of game that football has become : a billion-dollar business , a prestige object for louche plutocrats , and an extravagant show@@ piece for corrupt governments and international sporting organizations .
football was once a popular sport , rooted in local communities .
local working-class boys played for local clubs that inspired fierce loyalty among fans .
some clubs were financed by industrial corporations in order to promote loyalty among their workers : philips sponsored the dutch club psv eindhoven , for example , while fiat played the same role for italy ’ s juventus .
but , regardless of the sponsorship or the location , fans felt close to most of the clubs , as well as to their national teams .
they were part of people ’ s “ identity . ”
this is still true to some extent , but something crucial has changed : football , like other types of commerce , has gone global .
thanks to new ownership rules , cable television , product endorsements , and other business-@@ related factors , there are probably more supporters of manchester united in china than there are in the united kingdom , let alone in the city of manchester .
football teams are now like multinational franchises , with coaches and players from all over the world .
but this alone does not account for the kind of alienation from the game expressed by the brazilian protesters .
the worldwide reach of football was preceded by that of the olympic games , and it is here where we should turn to understand the corruption of globalized sports .
unlike football , the olympics were always closely associated with elites : amateur athletes recruited from universities , and so on . the father of the modern olympic games , baron de cour@@ ber@@ tin , was a french aristocrat who promoted sports to reinvigorate the men of france after their defeat in the franco-prussian war of 1871 .
his aim for the olympic games was to embody a noble ideal of world peace and brotherhood through athletic competition .
how easily this ideal could be corrupted by distinctly ung@@ entle@@ manly politics was already clear in 1936 , when coubertin ’ s dod@@ dering speech about peace and fair play was played over the loud@@ speakers of the olympic stadium in berlin , while hitler and his henchmen raised their arms to salute the nazi flag .
but even without noisome politics , the sheer amount of money required to stage the olympic games – the building contracts for stadiums , transport infrastructure , and hotels , together with all the other commercial ra@@ zz@@ mat@@ azz – was bound to produce a culture of bribery and kickbacks .
an international elite of olympic officials arose , living in a self-contained bubble of wealth and privilege .
i once had occasion to watch these men as they tro@@ oped in and out of first-class hotels in an asian capital , sleek figures in gold-@@ but@@ toned bla@@ zers .
it was striking to see how often the most prosper@@ ous-@@ looking representatives came from the world ’ s poorest countries .
football is now like the olympics ( or formula 1 racing ) , except that even more money is involved .
football clubs have become the status symbols of newly rich tycoons from russia or the middle east , and international competitions , especially the world cup , have become occasions to bolster the prestige , and sometimes even the legitimacy , of national governments .
such events reinforce the tendency of modern political regimes , dictatorships as well as democracies , to measure themselves in monumental building projects – giant new stadiums , gargantuan shopping malls , huge conference halls – which are sometimes needed , but often are not .
as a result , developers , architects , politicians , tycoons , and international sporting officials are now in charge of the beautiful game .
this adds to their power , wealth , and prestige .
but once they have staged their spectacles , at vast expense to the host country , they move on .
this is especially galling in countries where much of the population is poor and deprived of decent schools or proper medical services .
millions of brazilians have made clear where their priorities lie .
they haven ’ t fallen out of love with football .
on the contrary , by protesting against the grotesque manipulation of the modern game , they are trying to take it back .

cambridge – last month , china ’ s new president , xi jinping , chose moscow for his first foreign visit .
he and russian president vladimir putin announced a number of agreements and then traveled to durban , south africa , for the fifth “ brics ” summit , where they joined with the leaders of india , brazil , and south africa to announce the creation of a new development bank that could challenge the dominance of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
the five leaders ’ speeches referred to a shifting world order , and xi said “ the potential of brics development is infinite . ”
it looked as if the brics had finally come of age .
three years ago , i was skeptical about the brics .
and , despite the recent summit ’ s apparent success , i still am .
nearly 12 years ago , jim o ’ neill , then the chief economist for goldman sachs , coined the term “ bric ” to describe the “ emerging markets ” of brazil , russia , india , and china .
from 2000 to 2008 , these four countries ’ share of global output rose rapidly , from 16 % to 22 % ( in purchasing power parity terms ) , and their economies performed better than average in the subsequent global recession .
for investors , that outcome justified the creation of the catchy acronym .
but then a strange thing happened : the investors ’ creature came to life .
in 2009 , the four countries met for the first time in russia in an effort to forge an international political organization .
south africa joined the bloc in late 2010 primarily for political reasons .
as o ’ neill recently told china daily , “ south africa is quite fortunate enough to be in the group , as , economically , it is rather small compared to the others . ” moreover , its economic performance has been relatively sluggish , with a growth rate of just 2.3 % last year .
indeed , while the brics may be helpful in coordinating certain diplomatic tactics , the term lumps together highly disparate countries .
not only is south africa miniscule compared to the others , but china ’ s economy is larger than those of all of the other members combined .
likewise , india , brazil , and south africa are democracies , and occasionally meet in an alternative forum that they call “ ibsa . ”
and , while the large autocracies , russia and china , find it diplomatically advantageous to tweak the americans , both have different but crucial relationships with the united states .
and both have worked to thwart efforts by india , brazil , and south africa to become permanent members of the united nations security council .
as i wrote three years ago , in analytical terms , it makes little sense to include russia , a former superpower , with the developing economies .
russia lacks diversified exports , faces severe demographic and health problems , and , in former president dmitri medvedev ’ s words , “ greatly needs modernization . ”
little has changed since putin returned to the presidency last year .
while economic growth benefited from the dramatic growth in oil and gas prices during the last decade , other competitive industries have yet to emerge , and the country now faces the prospect of declining energy prices .
while it aims to maintain 5 % annual growth , its economy was relatively flat last year .
if russia ’ s power resources seem to be declining , brazil ’ s appear to be more impressive , given it has a territory nearly three times the size of india ’ s , a 90 % literacy rate , and triple the per capita income of india ( and nearly twice that of china ) .
but , in the three years since my earlier assessment , brazil ’ s performance has slipped : annual economic growth has slowed from 7.5 % in 2010 to 1 % last year , with a 3.5 % rate expected in 2013 .
unless it improves its infrastructure and literacy rate ( particularly for women ) , india is unlikely to catch up with china .
so , should we take today ’ s brics more seriously than the brics of three years ago ?
that lack of unity is symptomatic of the brics members ’ underlying incompatibilities .
in political terms , china , india , and russia are vying with each other for power in asia .
and , in economic terms , brazil , india , and south africa are concerned about the effects of china ’ s undervalued currency on their economies .
three years ago , i wrote that , “ bric is not likely to become a serious political organization of like-minded states . ”
the brics ’ most recent meeting has given me no reason to revise that assessment .

why capital flows uphill
london – at first , it seems difficult to grasp : global capital is flowing from poor to rich countries .
emerging-market countries run current-account surpluses , while advanced economies have deficits .
one would expect fast-growing , capital-scarce ( and young ) developing countries to be importing capital from the rest of world to finance consumption and investment .
so , why are they sending capital to richer countries , instead ?
china is a case in point .
with its current-account surplus averaging 5.5 % of gdp in 2000-2008 , china has become one of the world ’ s largest lenders .
despite its rapid growth and promising investment opportunities , the country has persistently been sending a significant portion of its savings overseas .
and china is not alone .
other emerging markets – including brazil , russia , india , mexico , argentina , thailand , indonesia , malaysia , and the middle eastern oil exporters – have all increased their current-account surpluses significantly since the early 1990 ’ s .
collectively , capital-scarce developing countries are lending to capital-abundant advanced economies .
many observers believe that these global imbalances reflect developing economies ’ financial integration , coupled with underdevelopment of domestic financial markets .
according to this view , these countries ’ demand for assets cannot be met – in terms of both quantity and quality – at home , so they deploy part of their savings to countries like the us , which can offer a more diverse array of quality assets .
while plausible , this argument suggests that , as financial markets improve over time in developing countries , the global imbalances are bound to shrink .
but such a reversal is nowhere in sight .
why ?
a crucial dimension of globalization has been trade liberalization .
for china , foreign trade as a percentage of gdp soared from 25 % in 1989 to 66 % in 2006 , largely owing to its admission to the world trade organization in 2001 .
most of what china and other developing countries produce and export are labor-intensive goods such as textiles and apparel .
this has allowed advanced economies , in turn , to produce and export more capital-intensive , higher-value-added products .
globalization of trade enabled countries to tap the efficiency gains that specialization in their sectors of comparative advantage has brought about .
with a slight mental stretch , one can imagine that what a country produces and trades may affect its savings and investment decisions .
an economy in which the main productive activity is berry picking , for example , has little need for investment and capital accumulation .
its laborers earn wages , consume , and save part of that income .
since the production process requires little capital , there is no demand for domestic investment – and thus no savings vehicles .
instead , the only way to save is by purchasing capital abroad – in economies with capital-intensive production and demand for investment .
this economy will always export its savings .
that may be an extreme example , but it illustrates a more general point about how merchandise trade can influence financial flows .
countries that produce and export more labor-intensive goods – perhaps owing to increased trade openness , or faster labor-force and productivity growth , all of which are true of china – may experience a rise in saving , but a less-than-@@ equivalent increase in demand for capital .
rich countries , by contrast , are able to export more capital-intensive goods , and thus have a greater need for investment .
so they may be importing more capital – resulting in a greater current-account deficit – simply because they are producing more capital-intensive goods .
with developing countries – in particular , china , india , and the ex-soviet bloc – bringing almost 1.5 billion workers into the world economy since the early 1990 ’ s , it is not difficult to understand the potential impact of this effect .
after all , much of this labor force was absorbed by labor-intensive industries that eventually churned out products exported to the rest of the world .
indeed , that massive addition of labor helped to drive down the relative price of labor-intensive goods , which fell by roughly 15 % between 1989 and 2008 .
as developing countries increased their labor-intensive production and exports , their current-account surpluses rose – by almost 3.6 percentage points , on average , between 1989-@@ 1993 and 2002-2006 .
china ’ s current-account surplus increased by almost 11 percentage points over the same period , india ’ s by 2.5 percentage points , and russia ’ s by seven percentage points .
these countries , as well as other large surplus economies , such as brazil , saudi arabia , and iran , all experienced a simultaneous increase in the labor content of exports .
this pattern contrasts with that of the united states and many other advanced countries , which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive .
many might doubt the view that china is exporting more labor-intensive goods , rather than upgrading its exports on the capital- and skill-@@ intensity ladder .
but trade data suggest the opposite , perhaps because china ’ s accession to the wto led to tariff reductions that released more labor-intensive production .
in fact , trade data may underestimate the true extent of china ’ s labor intensity and@@ overstate the capital and skill intensity of china ’ s exports .
china has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade : assembling intermediate inputs – imported from countries like the us and japan – that have high capital and skill content .
so , while the exports of these final goods may count towards china ’ s own capital and skill content , the country ’ s real role was only in the labor-intensive process of assembly .
a country ’ s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs .
so the fact that capital may flow towards rich countries that produce and export more capital-intensive goods should not be so puzzling , after all .

why castro survives
in a rehearsal studio , a young cuban ballet dancer turns through the air , pivoting as though some invisible power has unfurled him in an arc .
then , without pause , he leaps once , twice , and i gasp at the height of his grandes jetés and then gasp again because his pointed toe is heading right for a barre .
welcome to cuba , a country that dazzles and disappoints , where one finds miracles and monsters , but no easy answers .
cubans recognize the contradictions as readily as any outsider .
yet even as inflation rises and the 77-year-old dictator tightens internet access and closes the economic openings that encouraged self-employment in the mid-1990 &apos;s , it is unlikely that cubans will turn castro out before he dies .
the rabidly anti-@@ castro cuban exiles clustered in miami argue that it is fear that holds cubans back , but that &apos;s not true .
a visitor in cuba finds many ready to complain , but the palpable fear and visceral hatred rampant in el salvador and chile in the 1980 &apos;s is absent in today &apos;s cuba .
instead there is a kind of paralysis - born of a mix of loyalty , fear , and indoctrination - as they grudgingly wait for castro to expire .
so , unlike the east europeans who overthrew their corrupt political leaders in 1989 , and some latin americans who did so more recently in bolivia , argentina , and ecuador , cubans have failed to rally against castro .
yes , castro jailed 75 independent journalists and others in an april sweep - that is the monster in him .
but other dissidents remain free .
that is the contradiction .
moreover , unlike other luxury-@@ loving latin american leaders , cuban officials do not flaunt lavish lifestyles .
among latin american countries , only chile and uruguay rate better than cuba in transparency international &apos;s corruption index .
but this could change as dollars become hard to resist and cubans use them to cut through ridiculous bureaucratic hurdles .
already , the dollar has created a divide in living standards between those who have greenbacks and those who don &apos;t .
despite a moribund economy , castro still delivers what the majority of latin american residents fail to get - free health care and education and a relatively drug- and crime-@@ free environment .
with more than 40 % of latin america &apos;s population living in poverty , cuba stands out as an example of a country where being poor does not mean a life of squalor .
even world bank president james wolfensohn acknowledged in 2001 that cuba had done a &quot; great job &quot; on education and health care .
more recently , in discussing the bank &apos;s 2004 report making services work for poor people , officials put cuba among countries like sri lanka , costa rica , and china that &quot; managed to achieve a level of outcomes in health and education that are extremely favorable . &quot;
this winter , the cuban government reinvested some of its income from tourism in upgrading schools that deteriorated in the years following the loss of soviet aid . &quot; cubans are still endeared by that , &quot; said one western diplomat .
amazingly , many latin america leaders fail to make the connection between reducing poverty and their own popularity .
compare castro &apos;s campaign to improve schools to a poverty reduction program waged by mexico &apos;s institutional revolutionary party during a six-year period in the 1990 &apos;s .
mexico spent 1.2 % of gdp per year to provide basic services to communities in mexico .
according to santa deverajan , the director of the world bank &apos;s world development report 2004 , some studies showed that the program could have reduced poverty by as much as 64 % .
instead , the money was doled out to municipalities based on political loyalty , so poverty fell by only 3 % . &quot; if they had just given it out equally to the entire mexican population , &quot; deverajan says , &quot; it would have reduced poverty by 13 % . &quot;
examples like this abound in latin america , but it is a mistake for castro to think that latin america is the competition .
cubans don &apos;t think it is .
their touch@@ stones are madrid , paris , and new york .
an educated professional with a wife and two children takes a breath when he recalls a trip to spain . &quot; it &apos;s hard to explain how i felt when i went there .
it wasn &apos;t like another world or another planet ; it was like another galaxy . &quot;
with family in spain , he could immigrate , but he doesn &apos;t consider that option seriously . &quot; this is where i want to live , but 5 % of the way things are run has got to change .
they blame everything on the embargo .
we have a self-imposed embargo .
we limit ourselves . &quot;
more precisely , castro limits cubans .
they want to breathe , but life with a patriarchal tyrant can be suffocating .
younger cubans often sound like well-educated teenagers with parents who are too strict .
they want to travel , publish what they want , dance when and where they want , and experience the world as castro experienced it .
&quot; it &apos;s not my fight , &quot; says one 28-year-old cuban , referring to the political battle of communism versus capitalism that keeps him trapped on the island . &quot; i &apos;m a new generation .
i want to see as they had the chance to see . &quot;

why china can ’ t adjust
claremont , california – china ’ s current economic slowdown has no shortage of causes : europe ’ s financial turmoil , sputtering recovery in the united states , and weak domestic investment growth , to name the most commonly cited factors .
since exports and investment account , respectively , for 30 % and 40 % of china ’ s gdp growth , its economy is particularly vulnerable to weakening external demand and accumulation of non-performing loans caused by excessive and wasteful spending on fixed assets .
but china ’ s vulnerability to these factors , as serious as they are , is symptomatic of deeper institutional problems .
until these underlying constraints are addressed , talk of a new consumption-based growth model for china , reflected in the government ’ s recently approved 12th five-year plan , can be no more than lip service .
after all , china ’ s major trading partners , international financial institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund , and senior chinese officials themselves have long recognized the structural vulnerabilities caused by excessive investment and low household consumption .
and , for nearly a decade , china has been urged to undertake reforms to redress these economic patterns , which have undermined the welfare of ordinary chinese and strained the global trading system .
the best-known feature of china ’ s macroeconomic imbalances is heavy dependence on exports for growth , which is typically attributed to weak domestic demand : as a middle-income country , china lacks the purchasing power to consume the goods that it produces .
with nearly unlimited access to advanced-country markets , china can tap into global external demand and raise its gdp growth potential , as it has done for the past two decades .
if this view is right , the solution is straightforward : china can correct its imbalances by increasing its citizens ’ incomes ( by cutting taxes , raising wages , or increasing social spending ) , so that they can consume more , thereby reducing the economy ’ s dependence on exports .
indeed , nearly all mainstream economists prescribe this approach for china .
but there is another explanation for china ’ s excessive export dependence , one that has more to do with the country ’ s poor political and economic institutions .
specifically , export dependence partly reflects the high degree of difficulty of doing business in china .
official corruption , insecure property rights , stifling regulatory restraints , weak payment discipline , poor logistics and distribution , widespread counterfeiting , and vulnerability to other forms of intellectual-property theft : all of these obstacles increase transaction costs and make it difficult for entrepreneurs to thrive in domestic markets .
by contrast , if china ’ s private firms sell to western multinationals , such as wal-mart , target , or home depot , they do not have to worry about getting paid .
they can avoid all of the headaches that they would have encountered at home , because well-established economic institutions and business practices in their export markets protect their interests and greatly reduce transaction costs .
the chinese economy ’ s institutional weakness is reflected in international survey data .
in its june 2011 survey , china was ranked 9@@ 1st , behind mongolia , albania , and belarus .
faced with such a hostile environment , chinese private entrepreneurs have been forced to engage in “ institutional arbitrage ” – taking advantage of efficient western economic institutions to expand their business ( most export-oriented businesses are owned by private entrepreneurs and foreign firms ) .
unfortunately , as china has already claimed a large share of the world ’ s merchandise exports ( 10.4 % in 2010 ) and economic stagnation in the west is constraining external demand , this strategy can no longer work .
but reorienting their businesses toward the chinese domestic market requires far more than government policies that put more money in consumers &apos; pockets .
in order to enjoy the same low transaction costs that they have in exporting , china ’ s entrepreneurs need a much better business environment : an effective legal system , a sound regulatory framework , a government that protects their brands by fighting intellectual-property theft , dependable logistics and distribution networks , and a gra@@ ft-@@ resistant bureaucracy .
china cannot create such an environment quickly .
in essence , the chinese government must transform a predatory state into a nurturing one , and treat private entrepreneurs as creators of wealth rather than targets of extraction .
in nearly all other countries , such a transformation was accomplished by establishing the rule of law and / or moving from autocracy to democracy .
the impossibility of sustaining growth in the absence of the rule of law and political accountability presents the chinese communist party with an existential dilemma .
ever since it crushed the pro-democracy movement in tiananmen square in 1989 , the party has vowed not to surrender its political monopoly .
the investment boom and the globalization dividend of the last two decades allowed the party to have its cake and eat it – maintaining its rule on the basis of economic prosperity , while failing to establish the institutions critical to sustaining such prosperity .
today , this is no longer possible .
so in a sense , the chinese bubble – as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one – has burst .
as china ’ s economic deceleration exposes its structural vulnerabilities and flawed policies , the much-hyped notion of “ chinese exceptionalism ” – that china can continue to grow without the rule of law and the other essential institutions that a modern market economy presupposes – is proving to be nothing but a delusion .

china is not collapsing
london – one question has dominated the international monetary fund ’ s annual meeting this year in peru : will china ’ s economic downturn trigger a new financial crisis just as the world is putting the last one to bed ?
but the assumption underlying that question – that china is now the global economy ’ s weakest link – is highly suspect .
china certainly experienced a turbulent summer , owing to three factors : economic weakness , financial panic , and the policy response to these problems .
while none on its own would have threatened the world economy , the danger stemmed from a self-reinforcing interaction among them : weak economic data leads to financial turmoil , which induces policy blunders that in turn fuel more financial panic , economic weakness , and policy mistakes .
such self-reinforcing financial feedback is much more powerful in transmitting global economic contagion than ordinary commercial or trade exposures , as the world learned in 2008-2009 .
the question now is whether the vicious circle that began in china over the summer will continue .
a sensible answer must distinguish between financial perceptions and economic reality .
china ’ s growth slowdown is not in itself surprising or alarming .
as the imf noted , china ’ s growth rate has been declining steadily for five years – from 10.6 % in 2010 to a projected rate of 6.8 % this year and 6.3 % in 2016 .
this deceleration was inevitable as china advanced from extreme poverty and technological backwardness to become a middle-income economy powered by external trade and consumer spending .
it was also desirable , because rapid growth was hitting environmental limits .
even as the pace of growth slows , china is contributing more to the world economy than ever before , because its gdp today is $ 10.3 trillion , up from just $ 2.3 trillion in 2005 .
simple arithmetic shows that $ 10.3 trillion growing at 6 % or 7 % produces much bigger numbers than 10 % growth starting from a base that is almost five times smaller .
this base effect also means that china will continue to absorb more natural resources than ever before , despite its diminishing growth prospects .
yet china is causing high anxiety , especially in emerging countries , largely because financial markets have convinced themselves that its economy is not only slowing , but falling off a cliff .
many western analysts , especially in financial institutions , treat china ’ s official gdp growth of around 7 % as a political fabrication – and the imf ’ s latest confirmation of its 6.8 % estimate is unlikely to convince them .
they point to steel , coal , and construction statistics , which really are collapsing in several chinese regions , and to exports , which are growing much less than in the past .
but why do the skeptics accept the truth of dismal government figures for construction and steel output – down 15 % and 4 % , respectively , in the year to august – and then dismiss official data showing 10.8 % retail-@@ sales growth ?
one reason can be found in the financier george soros ’ s concept of “ reflexivity . ”
soros has argued for years that financial markets can create inaccurate expectations and then change reality to accord with them .
this is the opposite of the process described in textbooks and built into economic models , which always assume that financial expectations adapt to reality , not the other way round .
in a classic example of reflexivity , when china ’ s stock-market boom turned into july ’ s bust , the government responded with a $ 200 billion attempt to support prices , closely followed by a small devaluation of the previously stable renminbi .
financial analysts almost universally ridiculed these policies and castigated chinese leaders for abandoning their earlier pretenses of market-oriented reforms .
the government ’ s apparent desperation was seen as evidence that china was in far greater trouble than previously revealed .
this belief quickly shaped reality , as market analysts blurred the distinction between a growth slowdown and economic collapse .
in mid-september , for example , when the private-sector purchasing managers ’ index ( pmi ) came out at 4@@ 7.0 , the result was generally reported along these lines : “ the index has now indicated contraction in the &#91; manufacturing &#93; sector for seven consecutive months . ”
in fact , chinese manufacturing was growing by 5-7 % throughout that period .
the supposed evidence was wrong because 50 is the pmi ’ s dividing line not between growth and recession , but between accelerating and slowing growth .
indeed , for 19 out of the pmi ’ s 36 months of existence , the value has been below 50 , while chinese manufacturing growth has averaged 7.5 % .
exaggerations of this kind have undermined confidence in chinese policy at a particularly dangerous time .
china is now navigating a complex economic transition that involves three sometimes-@@ conflicting objectives : creating a market-based consumer economy ; reforming the financial system ; and ensuring an orderly slowdown that avoids the economic collapse often accompanying industrial restructuring and financial liberalization .
managing this trifecta successfully will require skillful juggling of priorities – and that will become much more difficult if chinese policymakers lose international investors ’ trust or , more important , that of china ’ s own citizens and businesses .
vicious circles of economic instability , devaluation , and capital flight have brought down seemingly unbreakable regimes throughout history .
this probably explains the whiff of panic that followed china ’ s tiny , but totally unexpected , devaluation of the renminbi .
the renminbi , however , has recently stabilized , and capital flight has dwindled , as evidenced by the better-than-expected reserve figures released by the people ’ s bank of china on october 7 .
this suggests that the government ’ s policy of shifting gradually to a market-based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed ; even the measures to support the stock market now look less futile than they did in july .
in short , chinese economic management seems less incompetent than it did a few months ago .
indeed , china can probably avoid the financial meltdown widely feared in the summer .
if so , other emerging economies tied to perceptions about china ’ s economic health should also stabilize .
the world has learned since 2008 how dangerously financial expectations can interact with policy blunders , turning modest economic problems into major catastrophes , first in the us and then in the eurozone .
it would be ironic if china ’ s communist leaders turned out to have a better understanding of capitalism ’ s reflexive interactions among finance , the real economy , and government than western devotees of free markets .

why china &apos;s falun gong movement is important
beijing : continuing suppression of members of fal@@ ong gong , a movement whose supporters continue to “ step forward ” to respond to their leader ’ s call to “ achieve consummation by facing imprisonment or death , ” provides clear evidence that something new , if inexplicable , is happening in china .
but there is a paradox here , for this “ something new ” is also something very old .
it is precisely because this mass cult-@@ turned-@@ protest-@@ movement has a traditional resonance that it poses such a threat to the party establishment .
when , in april 1999 , ten thousand members of the falun gong sect appeared mysteriously in front of zhongnanhai , the compound of the chinese communist party ’ s leadership , to be arrested en masse , observers found it hard to explain what was going on .
the overseas press corps in beijing was used to explaining political dissidents , student protesters , disgruntled workers and disenfranchised members of the “ floating population . ”
this mystical , crypto buddhist / taoist sect of middle class medi@@ tators , however , seemed to arise out of nowhere so that its origins and seriousness as a threat to china ’ s party establishment were difficult to assess .
the group , it turned out , was led by an exiled patriarch , li hongzhi , who had conjured his cult out of traditional chinese breathing exercises ( qigong ) , a belief in miracle cures , nostrums about clean living , and a mish-mash of buddhist and taoist mysticism .
as wave after wave of falun gong supporters arrived in tiananmen square to be arrested , however , what began as an aberrant event became the most widespread movement of organized protest in china since 1989 .
what makes falun gong so threatening is that not only is it led by a very traditionalistic leader , but that its mystical doctrine and charismatic rebelliousness evoke for chinese an ingrained sense of historical memory of past ruling dynasties that fell after being challenged by a similar internal millenarian movement .
for chinese , such cul@@ tic movements have deep symbolic significance because of their association with the idea of dynastic decay and collapse .
few chinese do not know legends and stories from history , which are passed down through the generations in novels , operas , plays and now films , comic books and even tv series .
these stories tell of how the han dynasty ’ s ( 206 b.@@ c-@@ 422 a.@@ d ) end was presaged by the mystical yellow tur@@ ban rebellion or of how the qing dynasty ( 1644-1911 ) , china ’ s last , ran afoul of the equally mystical white lotus and then the boxer rebellions .
cult-@@ animated uprisings against unjust authority , with which falun gong is now identified , have always been viewed by chinese as port@@ ents that political legitimacy -- sanctioned by the so-called “ mandate of heaven ” ( tianming ) that is said to exist when “ heaven ” confers its favor on a ruling dynasty -- has been withdrawn .
for a government such as that now ruling china , one which does not derive legitimacy from the will of the people , the deeply rooted cultural presumption of ordinary people that the cosmic forces of heaven no longer shine on it , could deal a devastating psychological blow .
so , falung gong is viewed as an ominous threat to party hegemony , perhaps even more ominous than any previous protest movement .
there are four reasons for this :
 because it has deep traditional and nativist chinese roots , falung gong ’ s message cannot be branded as an imported and inappropriate foreign ideology in the way that notions of democracy and christianity are dismissed by chinese nationalists and xenophobes ;
 because the destruction of traditional confucian values during mao ’ s revolution and then the implosion of marxist ideology during deng xiaoping ’ s economic reform era left china bereft of a coherent belief system , many chinese are susceptible to any group that offers basic answers to questions about the meaning of life ;
 unlike student protesters who were basically rationalists and usually had clear demands to which the party could respond ( if it wished ) , li hongzhi ’ s critique that contemporary chinese life has fallen into a morass of immorality and venality brooks no easy response ;
 because this diffuse but mass-based sect communicates with its members by word of mouth and over the internet rather than by conventional means , it is difficult for the party to disrupt its nerve centers .
in this sense falun gong is a double paradox : a traditionalistic movement freighted with deep historical symbolism , it is also a cyber-@@ savvy , modern chinese protest movement .
nothing in china ever seems to happen quite in the way china experts predict .
virtually no expert foresaw the events of 1989 ; no expert whom i know imagined that china ’ s next wave of destabilizing protest might come from a mass movement of superstitious middle-aged , middle-class citizens dedicated to recycled notions of buddhist and taoist clean living , health through meditation , breathing exercises and mysticism spread via the internet .
by detaining thousands of sect followers the party may unwittingly transform an errant spiritual movement into a dangerous political force .

is state capitalism winning ?
cambridge – in the age-old contest of economic-growth models , state capitalism has seemed to be gaining the upper hand in recent years .
avatars of liberal capitalism like the united states and the united kingdom continued to perform anemically in 2012 , while many asian countries , relying on various versions of dirigisme , have not only grown rapidly and steadily over the last several decades , but have also weathered recent economic storms with surprising grace .
so , is it time to update the economics textbooks ?
in fact , economics does not say that unfettered markets are better than state intervention or even state capitalism .
the problems with state capitalism are primarily political , not economic . any real-world economy is riddled with market failures , so a benevolent and omnipotent government could sensibly intervene quite often .
but who has ever met a benevolent or omnipotent government ?
to understand the logic of state capitalism , it is useful to recall some early examples – not the socialist command economies or modern societies seeking to combat market failures , but ancient civilizations .
indeed , it seems that , like farming or democracy , state capitalism has been independently invented many times in world history .
consider the greek bronze age , during which many powerful states , organized around a city housing the political elite , formed throughout the mediterranean basin .
these states had no money and essentially no markets .
the state taxed agricultural output and controlled nearly all goods production .
it monopolized trade , and , in the absence of money , moved all of the goods around by fiat .
it supplied food and inputs to weavers and then took their output . in essence , the greek bronze age societies had something that looked remarkably like state capitalism .
so did the incas as they built their huge andean empire in the century before the spanish arrived .
how is it that societies as disparate as the greek bronze age cities of knossos , my@@ cen@@ ae , or pylos , the inca empire , soviet russia , south korea , and now china all ended up with state capitalism ?
the answer lies in recognizing that state capitalism is not about efficient allocation of economic resources , but about maximizing political control over society and the economy .
if state managers can grab all productive resources and control access to them , this maximizes control – even if it sacrifices economic efficiency .
to be sure , in many parts of the world , state capitalism has helped to consolidate states and centralize authority – preconditions for the development of modern societies and economies .
but political control of the economy generally becomes problematic , because those running the state do not have social welfare or optimal resource allocation in mind .
the state capitalism of the greek bronze age or the inca empire was not motivated by economic inefficiency ; nor did it necessarily create a more efficient economy .
what it did was help to consolidate political power .
at a deeper level , the real dichotomy is not between state capitalism and unfettered markets ; it is between extractive and inclusive economic institutions . extractive institutions create a non-@@ level playing field , rents , and narrowly concentrated benefits for those with political power and connections .
inclusive institutions create a level playing field and give incentives and opportunities to the great mass of people .
but herein lies the problem for state capitalism : inclusive institutions require a private sector powerful enough to counterbalance and check the state .
thus , state ownership tends naturally to remove one of the key pillars of an inclusive society .
it should be no surprise that state capitalism is almost always associated with authoritarian regimes and extractive political institutions .
this is not an endorsement of unfettered markets .
the state plays a central role in modern society , and rightly so .
modern economic growth , even under inclusive institutions , often creates deep inequalities and tilted playing fields , endangering those institutions ’ very survival .
the modern regulatory and redistributive state can , within certain bounds , help to redress these problems . but the success of such a project crucially depends on society having control over the state – not the other way around .
to argue that state capitalism ’ s success proves its superiority is to put the cart before the horse .
yes , south korea grew rapidly under state capitalism , and china is doing likewise today .
but state capitalism emerged not because there was no other way to ensure economic growth in these countries , but because it enabled growth without destabilizing the existing power structure .
the genius of china ’ s state capitalism is that it ensured the continued dominance of communist party elites while improving the allocation of resources , not that it alone could have provided price incentives to farmers and then managed liberalization of urban markets .
state capitalism will persist so long as existing elites are able to maintain it and benefit from it – even if economic growth ultimately stalls .
and there is a good reason why it eventually will .
sustained economic growth presupposes inclusive institutions , because innovation – and the creative destruction and instability that it wreaks – depends on them . extractive institutions in general , and state capitalism in particular , can support economic growth for a while , but only the sort of catch-up growth that south korea experienced from the 1960 ’ s to the 1980 ’ s , before starting to transform its society and economy more radically .
as the low hanging fruit from catch-up growth is consumed , china , too , will be forced to choose between the economic and social freedom , innovation , and instability that only inclusive institutions can underpin and continued economic , political , and social control in the service of the elites who control the state .

quitting the quota
hong kong – on march 1 , china ’ s state council announced a new batch of restrictions aimed at reining in property prices by curbing speculative demand .
the measures include tighter limits on home purchases by non-@@ locals in cities with excessive price gains , a reinforced 20 % capital-gains tax , mandatory 70 % down payments , and a 30 % benchmark interest-rate premium for second mortgages .
while the previous round of housing-sector restrictions , implemented less than two years ago , dampened market sentiment temporarily , it failed to curb rising property prices .
likewise , although the latest measures might have some impact , cooling china ’ s turbulent property market – which relies on cheap credit – in the long term will require addressing underlying monetary-policy weaknesses .
the policy is rooted in central planning , which , three decades ago , led to artificially low prices and , in turn , to shortages of basic necessities and key production inputs , such as grain and steel .
as the free market developed , a dual-price system emerged , in which those with access to quota-@@ allocated goods paid less .
as a result , the government was compelled to grant subsidies to the system ’ s “ losers ” – such as urban residents and state-owned enterprises ( soes ) – until strong supply responses to rising market prices eliminated the need for quotas on manufactured products .
a decade later , in response to the global financial crisis , china loosened credit quotas and planning controls on so@@ e-@@ run local-government infrastructure projects .
between november 2008 and june 2009 , china ’ s banks issued more than ¥ 8.6 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) in new loans . as a result , the rate of credit growth increased from 14 % in september 2008 to 35 % a year later , and property prices more than doubled in many cities .
excessively low interest rates have generated a mismatch between housing prices and the available supply , because they serve as hidden subsidies for those who can borrow – for example , the rich and soes – and thus stimulate demand for luxury property .
in order to curb this trend , policymakers have reverted to the quota as a macroeconomic tool , but this time for housing credit .
like quotas on manufactured products , these new quotas are generating a dual-price allocation system , in which soes can borrow at significantly lower interest rates than small and medium-size enterprises ( smes ) , which must rely on the informal market at interest rates as high as 2 % monthly .
but eliminating quotas in order to allow prices to reach market-clearing levels is not an option this time , owing to the complexity and competitiveness of the real-estate and bank-@@ credit markets .
first , the domestic interest groups that benefit from low borrowing costs have become a barrier to their liberalization .
there is a “ common-sense consensus ” among borrowers – in china , as well as in highly indebted advanced economies – that raising interest rates would undermine gdp growth , employment , and asset prices .
second , many argue that raising interest rates would trigger a flood of speculative capital from low-yielding advanced economies .
with the pboc unable to sterilize the inflows , upward pressure on the renminbi ’ s exchange rate would threaten competitiveness .
finally , an inadequate understanding of structural inflation ( the growth in prices for non-tradable assets ) has generated the false belief that china can maintain similar levels of inflation and exchange-rate stability as the oecd economies .
as a result , over the last decade , the chinese authorities ’ implicit target for annual inflation and currency appreciation has been only about 3 % .
but china has attained much higher gdp growth than the oecd economies , driven largely by the rapid productivity gains that characterize the initial “ catch up ” phase of emerging-market development .
as china continues to implement market-oriented reforms , the prices of non-tradable assets – such as property , natural resources , utilities , services , and wages – will continue to rise much faster than in the oecd countries , until they eventually converge .
this process will inevitably lead to higher structural inflation and currency appreciation in china .
if nominal interest rates are lower than the real return on investment – associated with gdp growth – the result is financial repression and increased income and wealth inequality .
to avoid this outcome , as long as china ’ s gdp growth exceeds that of oecd economies , its nominal interest rates must also be higher , its exchange rate must be more flexible , and it must tolerate higher structural inflation .
indeed , despite domestic resistance , the pboc must raise nominal interest rates so that they are in line with structural inflation .
such a move would deter excessive investment in productive capacity , and ease the implementation of a more flexible exchange-rate regime .
at the same time , one need only recall the damage that unregulated carry trades wrought on asian economies in the 1990 ’ s to understand why china must erect barriers to protect its domestic markets from inflows of hot money .
the alternative to this price-@@ oriented approach – continued dependence on the quota system – would incur considerable administrative expenses , efficiency losses , and social costs stemming from rent-seeking and corruption .
much like the quota system of 30 years ago , the current reliance on quotas is unsustainable in the long term .
to manage exorbitant demand for financial and physical assets , china ’ s leaders must address its root cause : the low cost of capital .
doing so will require maintaining some capital-account control , while raising interest rates to market-clearing levels .
this , not the unsustainable imposition of quotas , is the real monetary-policy challenge facing china today .

controlling china ’ s currency
beijing – it is indisputable that china is over-@@ issuing currency .
but the reasons behind china ’ s massive liquidity growth – and the most effective strategy for controlling it – are less obvious .
the last decade has been a “ golden age ” of high growth and low inflation in china .
from 2003 to 2012 , china ’ s annual gdp growth averaged 10.5 % , while prices rose by only 3 % annually .
but the unprecedented speed and scale of china ’ s monetary expansion remain a concern , given that it could still trigger high inflation and lead to asset-price bubbles , debt growth , and capital outflows .
data from the people ’ s bank of china ( pboc ) show that , as of the end of last year , china ’ s m2 ( broad money supply ) stood at ¥ 9@@ 7.4 trillion ( $ 15.6 trillion ) , or 188 % of gdp .
to compare , m2 in the united states amounts to only roughly 63 % of gdp .
in fact , according to standard chartered bank , china ranks first worldwide in terms of both overall m2 and newly issued currency .
in 2011 , china accounted for an estimated 52 % of the world ’ s added liquidity .
but a horizontal comparison of absolute values is inadequate to assess the true scale of china ’ s monetary emissions .
several other factors must be considered , including china ’ s financial structure , financing model , savings rate , and stage of economic development , as well as the relationship between currency and finance in china .
china ’ s intensive economic monetization is a key factor driving its money-supply growth .
but china ’ s sharply rising monetization rate cannot be judged against the high , steady rates of developed countries without bearing in mind that china ’ s monetization process began much later , and has distinct structural and institutional foundations .
as china has opened up its economy , deepened reforms , and become increasingly market-oriented , the government has facilitated the continuous monetization of resources – including natural resources , labor , capital , and technology – by ensuring their constant delivery to the market .
this has fueled rising demand for currency , leading to the expansion of the monetary base , with the money multiplier – that is , the effect on lending by commercial banks – boosting the money supply further .
and , as gdp growth has become increasingly dependent on government-led investment , currency demand has continued to rise .
indeed , the rapid expansion of bank credit needed to finance skyrocketing government-led investment is increasing the amount of liquidity in china ’ s financial system .
as a result , in the last four years , china ’ s m2 , spurred by a stimulus package totaling ¥ 4 trillion in 2008 and 2009 , has more than doubled .
this trend is exacerbated by the declining efficiency of financial resources in the state sector , a product of the soft budget constraint implied by easily accessible , cheap capital .
consequently , maintaining high gdp growth rates requires an ever-increasing volume of credit and a continuously growing money supply .
so china is stuck in a currency-creating cycle : gdp growth encourages investment , which boosts demand for capital .
this generates liquidity , which then stimulates gdp growth .
the key to controlling china ’ s monetary expansion is to clarify the relationship between currency ( the central bank ) and finance ( the financial sector ) , thereby preventing the government from assuming the role of a second currency-creating body .
according to pan gongsheng , a deputy governor of the pboc , the relationship between the central bank and the financial sector entails both a division of labor and a system of checks and balances .
in theory , the financial sector serves as a kind of accountant for the treasury and the government , while the pboc acts as the government ’ s cashier .
in practice , however , the relationship between currency and finance is vague , with both assuming quasi-fiscal functions .
china ’ s low official government debt largely reflects the role of currency in assuming quasi-fiscal liabilities – not only the write-off costs incurred from reforming state-owned banks , but also the takeover of banks ’ bad debts via note financing and the purchase of asset-management companies ’ bonds .
these activities both damage the pboc ’ s balance sheet and constrain monetary policy .
at the same time , finance takes on quasi-fiscal functions by excluding government fiscal deposits – government deposits in the national treasury , commercial banks ’ fiscal savings , and central treasury cash managed through commercial-bank deposits – from the money supply .
given the large volume of fiscal deposits – which totaled ¥ 2.4 trillion ( 3.3 % of m2 ) at the end of 2010 – their impact on the money supply cannot be ignored .
clarifying the relationship between currency and finance is essential to ensuring that all newly issued currency is backed by assets .
only by exerting a harder budget constraint on the state sector , limiting fiscal expansion , and reducing dependence on government-led investment can china ’ s excessive currency issuance be addressed in the long term .

why china won ’ t rule
this question is increasingly asked as china ’ s economic growth surges ahead at more than 8 % a year , while the developed world remains mired in recession or near-recession .
china is already the world ’ s second largest economy , and will be the largest in 2017 .
and its military spending is racing ahead of its gdp growth .
the question is reasonable enough if we don ’ t give it an american twist .
to the american mind , there can be only one superpower , so china ’ s rise will automatically be at the expense of the united states .
indeed , for many in the us , china represents an existential challenge .
this is way over the top .
in fact , the existence of a single superpower is highly abnormal , and was brought about only by the unexpected collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the normal situation is one of coexistence , sometimes peaceful sometimes warlike , between several great powers .
for example , great britain , whose place the us is often said to have taken , was never a “ superpower ” in the american sense .
despite its far-flung empire and naval supremacy , nineteenth-century britain could never have won a war against france , germany , or russia without allies .
britain was , rather , a world power – one of many historical empires distinguished from lesser powers by the geographic scope of their influence and interests .
the sensible question , then , is not whether china will replace the us , but whether it will start to acquire some of the attributes of a world power , particularly a sense of responsibility for global order .
even posed in this more modest way , the question does not admit of a clear answer .
the first problem is china ’ s economy , so dynamic on the surface , but so rickety underneath .
the analyst chi lo lucidly presents a picture of macro success alongside micro failure .
the huge stimulus of rmb4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) in november 2008 , mostly poured into loss-making state-owned enterprises via directed bank lending , sustained china ’ s growth in the face of global recession .
but the price was an increasingly serious misallocation of capital , resulting in growing portfolios of bad loans , while excessive chinese household savings have inflated real-estate bubbles .
moreover , chi argues that the crisis of 2008 shattered china ’ s export-led growth model , owing to prolonged impairment of demand in the advanced countries .
china now urgently needs to rebalance its economy by shifting from public investment and exports towards public and private consumption .
in the short run , some of its savings need to be invested in real assets abroad , and not just parked in us treasuries .
but , in the longer term , chinese households ’ excessive propensity to save must be reduced by developing a social safety net and consumer credit instruments .
moreover , to be a world economic power , china requires a currency in which foreigners want to invest .
that means introducing full convertibility and creating a deep and liquid financial system , a stock market for raising capital , and a market rate of interest for loans .
and , while china has talked of “ internationalizing ” the renminbi , it has done little so far .
“ meanwhile , ” writes chi , “ the dollar is still supported by the strong us political relations with most of the world ’ s largest foreign-@@ reserve-@@ holding countries . ”
japan , south korea , saudi arabia , kuwait , qatar , and the united arab emirates all shelter under the us military umbrella .
the second problem is one of political values .
china ’ s further “ ascent ” will depend on dismantling such classic communist policy icons as public-@@ asset ownership , population control , and financial repression .
the question remains how far these reforms will be allowed to go before they challenge the communist party ’ s political monopoly , guaranteed by the 1978 constitution .
two important cultural values underpin china ’ s political system .
the first is the hierarchical and familial character of chinese political thought .
chinese philosophers acknowledge the value of spontaneity , but within a strictly ordered world in which people know their place .
as the analects of confucius puts it : “ let the ruler be a ruler , the subject a subject , a father a father , and a son a son . ”
there is also very little belief in the sanctity of human life : buddhism holds that there is no difference between humans and animals and plants .
a pledge to protect human rights was written into the chinese constitution in 2004 ; but , as the recent case of the blind dissident chen guangcheng illustrates , this is mostly a dead letter .
similarly , private property ranks below collective property .
then there is the confucian doctrine of the “ mandate of heaven , ” by which political rule is legitimized .
today , the mandate of marxism has taken its place , but neither has any room for a mandate of the people .
ambivalence about the source of legitimate government is not only a major obstacle to democratization , but is also a potential source of political instability .
these historical legacies limit the extent to which china will be able to share in global leadership , which requires some degree of compatibility between chinese and western values .
the west claims that its values are universal , and the us and europe will not cease pressing those values on china .
it is hard to see this process going into reverse , with china starting to export its own values .
china has a choice : it can either accept western values , or it can try to carve out an east asian sphere to insulate itself from them .
the latter course would provoke conflict not only with the us , but also with other asian powers , particularly japan and india .
china ’ s best possible future thus probably lies in accepting western norms while trying to flavor them with “ chinese characteristics . ”
but neither choice is a scenario for china “ replacing ” the us .
nor , i think , is this what china wants .
its goal is respect , not dominance .

why cutting carbon emissions is not enough
twenty years ago , governments adopted the montreal protocol , a treaty to protect the earth ’ s ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals .
few could have foreseen how far-reaching that decision would prove to be .
the protocol explicitly aimed at phas@@ ing-out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ) – found in products such as refrigerators , fo@@ ams , and hair@@ sprays – in order to repair the thin gas@@ sy-@@ shield that filters out the sun ’ s harmful , ultra-@@ violet rays .
by 2010 , close to 100 ozone-depleting substances , including cfcs , will have been phas@@ ed-out globally .
without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting substances would have increased ten-fold by 2050 .
this could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife , and agriculture .
but this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the international day for the preservation of the ozone layer ( september 16 ) .
over the past two years , it has been established that the montreal protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases that it prohibits also contribute to global warming .
indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135 billion tons of co2 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of 7-12 years .
so the lessons learned from the montreal protocol may have wider significance .
scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than co2 , including nitrogen compounds , low-level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon .
of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants ’ precise contribution to warming remains .
but they certainly play a significant role .
meanwhile , many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture , and the planet ’ s multi-trillion dollar ecosystems , including forests .
consider black carbon , a component of the soot emissions from diesel engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking stoves that is linked to 1.6 million to 1.8 million premature deaths annually as a result of indoor exposure and 800,000 as a result of outdoor exposure .
black carbon , which absorbs heat from the sun , also accounts for anywhere from 10 % to more than 45 % of the contribution to global warming , and is also linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in asia , because the soot deposits darken , ice making it more vulnerable to melting .
one study estimates that 26 % of black carbon emissions are from stoves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop residues , and 10 % from dung .
some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows , better insulation , and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % .
mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green-economy benefits .
while co2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively periods – days , weeks , months , or years – so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits .
the international community ’ s over-arching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen in december to curtail c02 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt .
if the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed .

the centrists cannot hold
washington – in most advanced democracies , a large center-right party competes with a large center-left party .
of course , the extent to which an electoral system favors large parties – by having high popular-@@ vote thresholds to enter parliament , or through winner-take-all constituencies – affects the degree of political fragmentation .
but , by and large , the developed democracies are characterized by competition between large parties on the center left and center right .
what , then , are true centrists like mario monti , italy ’ s respected technocratic prime minister , to do ?
to be sure , regional and ethnic allegiances play a greater role in some places in europe – for example , scotland , belgium , and catalonia – but far more so in emerging countries , where political cleavages also reflect specific post-colonial circumstances and often the legacy of single-party rule .
nonetheless , even in “ emerging market ” democracies , such as chile , mexico , south korea , and india , a left-right cleavage plays an important role – while those who claim the political center generally remain weak .
the british liberal democrats , for example , have tried for decades to become a strong centrist third party , without success .
while the political vocabulary in the united states is different , the democratic party , since franklin roosevelt ’ s presidency , is indeed a center-left force , the republican party occupies the right , and no other significant party exists .
in france and germany , there is more fragmentation .
politics is still dominated by a large center-left party and a large center-right party , but smaller groups – some claiming the center and others the right and left extremes – challenge them to various degrees .
in some countries , the “ greens ” have their own identity , close to the left ; but , despite remarkable progress in germany , they remain unable to reach the electoral size of the large center-right and center-left parties .
variations of this basic structure exist in spain , portugal , greece , turkey , and the nordic countries .
the situation is particularly interesting in italy , where monti , having decided to contest the upcoming general election , has had to position himself on the right ( which he signaled by attending a gathering of the leaders of europe ’ s center-right parties ) .
he and former prime minister silvio berlusconi are now fighting for space on the right , with the center-left democrats leading in the polls .
there are at least four differences between center-right and center-left approaches to social and economic challenges .
the right has greater confidence in markets to allocate resources and provide appropriate incentives ; favors private consumption over public goods ; is minimally concerned with economic inequality ; and tends to be more nationalistic and less optimistic about international cooperation .
when looking at actual economic policies as they have evolved over decades , we see that they always combine center-right and center-left elements .
repeated financial crises have tempered even the right ’ s faith in unregulated markets , while the left has become more realistic and cautious about state planning and bureaucratic processes .
likewise , the choice between privately consumed and publicly consumed “ goods ” is often blurred , as politicians tend to reinforce citizens ’ understandable tendency to demand public goods while rejecting the taxes needed to pay for them .
as income inequality has increased – dramatically in some countries , such as the us – it is moving to the forefront of the debate , reinforcing the traditional political divide .
nonetheless , the center right and the center left are arguing about the degree of redistribution , not about the need for some progressivity in taxes and transfers .
both also agree on the need for international cooperation in an increasingly interdependent world , with differences mainly concerning how much effort to spend on it .
so , given that differences in policies as they are implemented have become largely a matter of degree , why do centrist parties remain weak ?
why have they failed to unite moderates on both sides of the ideological divide ?
one reason is that only a minority of any population is active politically .
active party members hold more ideologically consistent views – and hold them more strongly – than most of those who are politically less engaged , giving activists disproportionate influence in the political process .
after all , more nuanced ideas and policy proposals are relatively difficult to propagate effectively enough to generate broad and enthusiastic popular support .
but there also really are fundamental differences in values and economic philosophies , as well as in economic interests , leading to a fairly consistent positioning of voters on the right or left .
disagreement may lead to compromises , but that does not change the underlying differences in starting positions .
it is probably a good thing that structured competition between large center-right and center-left parties persists .
such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream , while facilitating alternation in power , which is essential to any democracy ’ s dynamism ; a system in which a large centrist party remained permanently in power would be far less desirable .
those , like monti , who want to mount a challenge from the center , however personally impressive they may be , have steep obstacles to overcome , and for good reasons .

why democracy requires trusted experts
paris – last month , i wrote a commentary asking why voters in the united kingdom supported leaving the european union , defying the overwhelming weight of expert opinion warning of the major economic costs of brexit .
i observed that many voters in the uk and elsewhere are angry at economic experts .
they say that the experts failed to foresee the financial crisis of 2008 , put efficiency first in their policy advice , and blindly assumed that the losers from their policy prescriptions could be compensated in some unspecified way .
i argued that experts should be humbler and more attentive to distributional issues .
the piece elicited far more comments from readers than any of my others .
their reactions mostly confirm the anger i had noted .
remarkably , i also received comments from professionals in the natural sciences who said that citizens ’ growing distrust of experts was pervasive in their disciplines , too .
scientific views in fields like energy , climate , genetics , and medicine face widespread popular rejection .
in the united states , for example , a pew research survey found that 67 % of adults think that scientists lack a clear understanding about the health effects of genetically modified organisms .
mistrust of gmos is even higher in europe .
whereas overall support for science remains strong , many citizens believe that it is manipulated by special interests , and on some issues , the common view departs from the established evidence .
this divide between experts and citizens is a cause for deep concern .
representative democracy is based not only on universal suffrage , but also on reason .
ideally , deliberations and votes result in rational decisions that use the current state of knowledge to deliver policies that advance citizens ’ wellbeing .
this requires a process in which experts – whose competence and honesty are trusted – inform decision-makers of the available options for meeting voters ’ stated preferences .
citizens are unlikely to be satisfied if they believe that experts are imposing their own agenda , or are captured by special interests .
distrust of experts fuels distrust of democratically elected governments , if not of democracy itself .
why is there such a divide between experts and society ?
every country has had its own series of high-profile public health or safety scandals .
experts have been guilty of sloppiness and conflicts of interest .
hard-won reputations have been quickly lost .
but critics often fail to recognize that science involves more – and more stringent – scrutiny than , say , business or government .
it is actually the standard-bearer of good practices concerning the validation of analyses and the discussion of policy proposals .
errors regularly occur in academia , but they are more swiftly and systematically corrected than in other fields .
the collective nature of scientific validation also provides guarantees against capture by special interests .
the problem may , in fact , be deeper than the common grievances against experts suggest .
a few decades ago , it was widely assumed that progress in mass education would gradually bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and popular belief , thereby contributing to a more serene and more rational democracy .
the evidence is that it has not .
as gerald bronner , a french sociologist , has convincingly shown , education neither increases trust in science nor diminishes the attraction of beliefs or theories that scientists regard as utter nonsense .
on the contrary , more educated citizens often resent being told by experts what science regards as truth .
having had access to knowledge , they feel empowered enough to criticize the cognoscenti and develop views of their own .
climate change – which the scientific community overwhelmingly regards it as a major threat – is a case in point .
according to a 2015 pew research survey , the three countries where concern is the weakest are the us , australia , and canada , whereas the three in which it is the strongest are brazil , peru , and burkina faso .
yet average years of schooling are 12.5 for the first group and six for the second .
evidently , education alone is not the reason for this difference in perception .
if the problem is here to stay , we had better do more to address it . first , we need more discipline on the part of the community of experts .
the intellectual discipline that characterizes research is often lacking in policy discussions .
humility , rigorous procedures , the prevention of conflicts of interest , an ability to acknowledge mistakes and , yes , punishment of fraudulent behavior are needed to regain citizens ’ trust .
second , there is a case for revising curricula to equip future citizens with the intellectual tools they will need to distinguish between fact and fiction .
society has everything to gain from citizens whose minds are both less suspicious and more critical .
finally , we need better venues for dialogue and informed debate .
serious magazines , general-@@ interest journals , and newspapers traditionally filled the space between the ether of peer-reviewed journals and the deep sea of hoaxes ; yet they all struggle to survive the digital revolution .
other venues , perhaps new institutions , are needed to fill that space .
what is clear is that democracy cannot thrive if it is left empty .

new york – with most of the world focused on economic instability and anemic growth in the advanced countries , developing countries , with the possible exception of china , have received relatively little attention .
but , as a group , emerging-market economies have been negatively affected by the recent downturn in developed countries .
the major emerging economies were the world ’ s main growth engines following the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008 , and , to some extent , they still are .
but their resilience has always been a function of their ability to generate enough incremental aggregate demand to support their growth , without having to make up for a large loss of demand in developed countries .
china , in turn , is a major market for final products , intermediate goods ( including those used to produce finished exports ) , and commodities . the ripple effect from europe ’ s stalling economy has thus spread rapidly to the rest of asia and beyond .
moreover , not only is the tradable sector of japan ’ s economy highly vulnerable to a slowdown in china , but the recent conflict over the senkaku / diaoyu islands raises the prospect of economic decoupling .
apart from that , japanese economic performance is set to remain weak , because the non-tradable side is not a strong growth engine .
the key questions for the world economy today , then , are how significant the growth slowdown will be , and how long it will last .
with wise policy responses , the impact is likely to be relatively mild and short-lived .
european banks , traditionally a major source of trade finance , have pulled back dramatically , owing to capital-adequacy problems caused by sovereign-debt capital losses and , in some cases , losses from real-estate lending .
this vacuum could reduce trade flows even if demand were present .
in asia , especially , filling the vacuum with alternative financing mechanisms has become a high priority .
in particular , although china ’ s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies , the government is likely to accept some short-run slowdown , rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures .
given the risk of re-@@ inflating asset bubbles , no one should expect a dramatic easing of credit of the type that followed the 2008 meltdown .
an accelerated public-investment program that avoids low-return projects is not out of the question .
but the best and most likely responses are those that accelerate domestic consumption growth by increasing household income , effectively deploy income from state-owned assets , and strengthen china ’ s social-security systems in order to reduce precautionary saving . indeed , these are all key components of china ’ s recently adopted 12th five-year plan .
admittedly , china ’ s major systemic reforms await the country ’ s leadership transition , now expected in november .
by most accounts , the pace of reform directed at expanding the market side of the economy needs to pick up quickly to achieve the ambitious economic and social goals of the next five years .
some countries have bucked the global trend .
indonesia , for example , has experienced accelerating growth , with rising business and consumer confidence boosting investment to almost 33 % of gdp .
likewise , brazil ’ s growth has been dented , but now looks set to recover . moreover , overall economic performance in brazil masks an important fact : growth rates have been substantially higher among the country ’ s poorer citizens , and unemployment is declining .
the aggregate growth rate does not capture this inclusiveness , and thus understates the pace of economic and social progress .
the main challenge for brazil is to increase its investment rate from 18 % of gdp currently to closer to 25 % , thereby sustaining rapid growth and economic diversification .
commodity dependence , even with the creation of considerable domestic value added , remains high .
economic-growth rates in other systemically large countries , including turkey and mexico , have risen as well , despite european and us headwinds .
many african countries , too , are showing a broad pattern of sound macroeconomic fundamentals , durable growth acceleration , economic diversification , and investor confidence .
the outlook for india ’ s economy remains more uncertain .
while growth slowed recently from very high rates – owing to a combination of exposure to developed-country weakness , internal loss of reform momentum , and declining investor confidence – that trend appears to be reversing after recent decisive corrective moves by the government .
the main question is whether india ’ s parliament will pass crucial legislation or remain paralyzed by hyper-partisan , scandal-@@ fueled infighting .
combining this general picture with more general developing-country trends – rising incomes , rapid growth in middle classes , expanding trade and investment flows , bilateral and regional free-trade agreements , and a growing share of global gdp ( roughly 50 % ) – these economies ’ growth momentum should return relatively rapidly , over the next 1-2 years .
most of the downside risk to this scenario lies in the systemically important economies of europe , the us , and china .
to derail emerging economies ’ growth momentum at this stage probably would require either an additional major demand shock from the advanced economies , or some kind of failure in china ’ s leadership transition that impedes systemic reform and affects the country ’ s growth .
notwithstanding low growth forecasts for the entire developed world , these systemic risks , taken individually and in combination , appear to be declining ( though certainly not to the point that they can be dismissed ) .
on balance , then , the multispeed growth patterns of the past decade are likely to continue .
even as the developed economies experience an extended period of below-trend growth , the emerging economies will remain an important growth engine .

why did economists not foresee the crisis ?
chicago – at the height of the financial crisis , the queen of england asked my friends at the london school of economics a simple question , but one for which there is no easy answer : why did academic economists fail to foresee the crisis ?
several responses to that query exist .
one is that economists lacked models that could account for the behavior that led to the crisis .
another is that economists were blinkered by an ideology according to which a free and unfettered market could do no wrong .
finally , an answer that is gaining ground is that the system bribed economists to stay silent .
in my view , the truth lies elsewhere .
it is not true that we academics did not have useful models to explain what happened .
if you believe that the crisis was caused by a shortage of liquidity , we had plenty of models analyzing liquidity shortages and their effects on financial institutions .
if you believe that the blame lies with greedy bankers and unthinking investors , lulled by the promise of a government bailout , or with a market driven crazy by irrational exuberance , we had studied all this too , in great detail .
economists even analyzed the political economy of regulation and deregulation , so we could have understood why some us politicians pushed the private sector into financing affordable housing , while others deregulated private finance .
yet , somehow , we did not bring all this understanding to bear and collectively shout our warnings .
perhaps the reason was ideology : we were too wedded to the idea that markets are efficient , market participants are rational , and high prices are justified by economic fundamentals .
but some of this criticism of “ market fundamentalism ” reflects a misunderstanding .
the dominant “ efficient markets theory ” says only that markets reflect what is publicly known , and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently – something verified by the hit that most investor portfolios took in the crisis .
the theory does not say that markets cannot plummet if the news is bad , or if investors become risk-averse .
critics argue that the fundamentals were deteriorating in plain sight , and that the market ( and economists ) ignored it .
we cannot point to a lonely cassandra like robert shiller of yale university , who regularly argued that house prices were unsustainable , as proof that the truth was ignored .
there are always naysayers , and they are often wrong .
there were many more economists who believed that house prices , though high , were unlikely to fall across the board .
of course , these expectations could have been distorted by ideology – it is hard to get into the past minds of economists .
but there is a better reason to be skeptical of explanations relying on ideology .
as a group , neither behavioral economists , who think that market efficiency is a joke , nor progressive economists , who distrust free markets , predicted the crisis .
could it be corruption ?
some academic economists consult for banks or rating agencies , give speeches to investor conferences , serve as expert witnesses , and carry out sponsored research .
it would be natural to suspect us of bias .
the bias could be implicit : our worldview is shaped by what our friends in industry believe .
or it may be an explicit bias : an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear , or give testimony that is purely mercenary .
there are enough instances of possible bias that the issue cannot be ignored .
one remedy would be to ban all interaction between economists and the corporate world .
but if economists were confined to the ivory tower , we might be unbiased , but we would also be ignorant of practicalities – and thus even less capable of predicting problems .
one way to restore trust may be disclosure – for economists to declare a monetary interest in a particular analysis and , more generally , to explain who pays us .
a number of universities are moving in this direction .
but i believe that corruption is not the main reason that the profession missed the crisis .
most economists have very little interaction with the corporate world , and these “ unbiased ” economists were no better at forecasting the crisis .
i would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure : specialization , the difficulty of forecasting , and the disengagement of much of the profession from the real world .
like medicine , economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-estate economists study , and vice versa .
yet , to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease .
because the profession rewards only careful , well-supported , but necessarily narrow analysis , few economists try to span sub-@@ fields .
even if they did , they would shy away from forecasting .
the main advantage that academic economists have over professional forecasters may be their greater awareness of established relationships between factors .
what is hardest to forecast , though , are turning points – when the old relationships break down .
while there may be some factors that signal turning points – a run-up in short-term leverage and asset prices , for example , often presages a bust – they are not infallible predictors of trouble to come .
the meager professional rewards for breadth , coupled with the inaccuracy and reputational risk associated with forecasting , leads to disengagement for most academics .
and it may well be that academic economists have little to say about short-term economic movements , so that forecasting , with all its errors , is best left to professional forecasters .
the danger is that disengagement from short-term developments leads academic economists to ignore medium-term trends that they can address .
if so , the true reason why academics missed the crisis could be far more mundane than inadequate models , ideological blindness , or corruption , and thus far more worrisome ; many simply were not paying attention !

islamabad – the men who attempted to kill 14-year-old malala yousafzai on october 9 knew what she represented .
her active involvement since the age of eleven in campaigning for the rights of girls in her region to be educated was well known .
malala ’ s efforts , while applauded by the west and some segments of pakistani society , were deeply resented by the obscurantist forces that go by the name of the taliban , which in pakistan calls itself tehrik-e-taliban pakistan .
their choice of name is an ironic one , for taliban , an arabic word , means those seeking to be educated , whereas the taliban ’ s principal aim is to keep muslim societies backward so that they can be persuaded to adopt a seventh-century version of islam .
education , particularly of women , stands in the way of achieving this goal .
but the attack on malala will , most likely , have an effect that is opposite to that intended by those who carried it out .
several religious leaders joined the chorus of condemnation that followed the attack on malala .
in a sign of unity , a council of sunni muslim scholars in the eastern city of lahore issued a fatwa , signed by 50 clerics , saying that the justifications cited by the girl ’ s attackers were “ deviant ” and had no basis in islamic law .
the taliban seem to have been taken aback by the public and media reaction to the attack .
dawn , pakistan ’ s largest-circulation english-language newspaper , reported that hakimullah mehsud , the pakistani taliban ’ s leader , had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in karachi , lahore , rawalpindi , and islamabad in response .
several tv channels had been extremely critical of the taliban ’ s assaults on pakistani society .
the extremists wanted to silence the majority that was waking up to the existential threat that radical islam poses to their country .
there is a widespread belief that pakistani women are doing poorly when it comes to obtaining education .
that impression is correct to some extent .
the overall literacy rate for women is undoubtedly low – much lower than that for men .
but male education and literacy in pakistan is not very high , either .
although pakistan is a signatory to the united nations millennium development goals , which include attainment of universal literacy for both boys and girls by 2015 , the country is far from achieving the target , with literacy rates of 70 % for boys and only 45 % for girls in 2010 .
that said , over the 17-year period from 1993 to 2010 , the number of girls enrolled in primary education increased from 3.7 million to 8.3 million .
this implies a rate of growth of 6.7 % a year , about 2.5 times the rate of increase in the number of girls entering the primary-school age cohort .
but , even with this growth rate , girls still accounted for just 44.3 % of the total number of enrolled students in 2010 .
it is in higher education that pakistani women have made extraordinary progress in recent years .
their share of total college enrollment has increased from 36 % to 57 % over the last couple of decades , rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 4@@ 36,000 in 2010 .
the proportion of women receiving higher education is approaching the 60 % mark , owing to an impressive 28 % annual rate of growth in their enrollment numbers in 2010 , up from a 20 % increase in 1993 .
although a very large number of girls drop out after primary school , the number completing higher education is now large .
this year , roughly 750,000 women will graduate from pakistan ’ s institutions of higher learning .
if the current rate of growth is maintained , by 2015 the number of women completing higher education could exceed 1.5 million a year .
had malala died , she eventually would have been forgotten – another victim of the war that the extremists are waging in pakistan .
her death would have added just one more individual to the tens of thousands who have already been killed in terrorist attacks across the country .
malala ’ s survival – and possibly even full recovery – provides a vibrant symbol for a troubled country .
she will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway .
it is not often recognized that women in pakistan – at least those of a certain class – are receiving the kind of education that enables them to enter the modern sectors of the economy or to become entrepreneurs .
in education , numbers make a revolution .
the extremists understand that all too well .

why do economies stop growing ?
milan – over the years , advanced and developing countries have experimented , sometimes deliberately and frequently inadvertently , with a variety of approaches to growth .
unfortunately , many of these strategies have turned out to have built-in limitations or deceler@@ ators – what one might call elements of unsustainability .
and avoiding serious damage and difficult recoveries requires us to get a lot better at recognizing these self-limiting growth patterns early on .
here are some of the items in a growing library of decelerating growth models .
in developing countries , import substitution as a way to jump-start economic diversification can work for a while ; but , over time , as productivity growth lags and comparative advantage is over-@@ ridden , growth grinds to a halt .
small , open economies are naturally somewhat specialized , which leaves them vulnerable to shocks and volatility .
but , in terms of growth and living standards , the cost of economic diversification , when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition , eventually outweighs the benefits .
it is better to allow specialization , and build effective social safety nets and support systems to protect people and families during economic transitions .
such “ structural flexibility ” is better adapted to enabling the broad changes that rapidly evolving technological and global economic forces require .
mismanagement of natural-resource wealth underpins an especially potent self-limiting pattern of growth and development .
if invested in infrastructure , education , and external financial assets , natural-resource revenues can accelerate growth .
but , too often , such revenues distort economic incentives , which come to favor rent-seeking and interfere with the diversification that is essential for growth .
more recently , many advanced countries have discovered a “ new ” set of growth models with built-in structural limitations : excessive private or public consumption , or both , usually accompanied and enabled by rising debt and inflated asset prices , and a corresponding decline in investment .
this approach appears to work until domestic aggregate demand can no longer sustain growth and employment , at which point it ends in either gradual stagnation or a violent financial and economic crisis .
( in fact , many developing countries have learned this the hard way , but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries . )
but the opposite of the excessive-@@ consumption model – excessive reliance on investment to generate aggregate demand – is also a self-limiting growth pattern .
when the private and social returns of investment diminish too much , growth cannot be sustained indefinitely , even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while .
altering this growth pattern is a significant part of the challenge that china now faces .
rising inequality in either opportunity or outcomes ( and often both ) also poses threats to the sustainability of growth patterns .
while people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market-determined income variation , based on differential talents and personal preferences , there are limits .
when they are breached , the typical result is a sense of unfairness , followed by resistance and , ultimately , political choices that address the inequality , though sometimes in counter-productive , growth-@@ impeding ways .
perhaps the largest long-run sustainability issue concerns the adequacy of the global economy ’ s natural-resource base : output will more than triple over the coming two or three decades , as high-growth developing economies ’ four billion people converge toward advanced-country income levels and consumption patterns .
existing economic-development strategies will require significant adaption to accommodate this kind of growth .
some adaptation will occur naturally , as rising energy and other commodity prices generate incentives to economize or seek alternatives .
but the un-@@ priced environmental externalities – global warming and water depletion , for example – will require serious attention , not myopic , reactive mindsets and approaches .
all of these self-limiting growth patterns tend to have three things in common . first , in one or several dimensions , some part of the economy ’ s base of tangible , intangible , and natural-resource assets is being run down .
i would include social cohesion as part of the asset base : it is the one that is depreciated by excessive inequality .
measurement issues play an important role here .
it is easier to run down something that is partly invisible because it is not regularly or effectively measured .
expanded measurement of the dimensions of economic , social , and environmental performance is necessary to broaden awareness of sustainability issues .
expectations come to exceed reality , and resetting the system to a sustainable growth pattern is difficult .
after all , past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future-oriented investments undertaken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation .
an inability to resolve the distributional and fairness problem can produce gridlock , paralysis , and prolonged stagnation .
finally , many of these flawed growth patterns involve fiscal distress .
contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays , some degree of keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period .
on the contrary , applied both individually and together , fiscal stimulus and consolidation are necessary parts of the adjustment process .
but they are not sufficient .
the crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible aggregate demand and restoration of those parts of the economy ’ s asset base that have been run down , implying the need for structural change and investment .

why does pain hurt ?
pain is a familiar experience for everyone , but its nature remains a troubling enigma for sufferers and scientists alike .
why do different patients who undergo the same surgical procedure experience markedly different post-@@ operative pain ?
how is it that people with little or no medical explanation for a persistent pain become partially or totally disabled by it , even with extensive and resourceful treatment ?
many doctors would like to think of pain as a simple sensation that usefully calls disease or injury to our attention .
but pain resists explanation as a simple sensation , just as music resists explanation as simple tones .
a contemporary non-medical writer described the qualities of intense pain as including extreme unpleasantness , an ability to annihilate complex thoughts and other feelings , an ability to destroy language , and a strong resistance to objectification .
she reminds physicians that , for the person suffering intense pain , what dominates awareness above all else is a powerful negative emotion .
most of the time , pain occurs after simple nerve endings detect tissue injury in various ways and generate signals that travel to the spinal cord and from there to the brain .
for many years , scientists thought that these signals traveled along a few well-defined routes to reach a relay station in the brain called the thalamus .
from there , scientists believed , the signals went on to the part of the brain &apos;s cortex that managed body awareness , and somehow the cortex turned them into conscious experience .
unfortunately , the neural roadmap for sensory messages of tissue injury explains only a part of how we experience pain .
it cannot explain why pain involves emotion and cognition .
psychologists are quick to point out that whenever humans experience strong emotions , cogni@@ tions--@@ thoughts , memories , expectations , beliefs , and interpretation of the situ@@ ation--@@ help form the experience .
in other words , pain may begin with a neural message of tissue injury or disease , but it is the end product of complex events within the brain .
the conscious experience of pain involves emotion and cognition as well as sensation .
we always experience pain as a distressing thing happening in some part of the body , in some particular circumstance , and usually it has a particular meaning .
new evidence points to more complex mechanisms for pain that involve higher levels of the brain .
injury messages , it seems , travel to many brain structures , not just to sensation-generating areas .
some injury messages directly excite brain structures that produce emotion , and these in turn stimulate areas of the brain that create the meaning of the immediate situation .
pain emerges into awareness only after sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes have combined to form a coherent , integrated pattern of experience .
as we might expect , sensation-generating areas are active , but so are structures in emotion@@ -@@ generating areas of the brain and structures related to attention and thinking .
even motor structures that enable so-called &quot; fight or flight &quot; responses to a dangerous situation become active .
such studies show that simple signals of tissue injury generate many simultaneous brain processes .
these processes combine to produce the private and unpleasant bodily awareness that we call pain .
because emotions and cogni@@ tions are an intrinsic part of the experience of pain , people differ greatly in their responses to a common injury , such as a standard surgical operation .
individual memory , beliefs , cultural background , and personal meaning all shape pain , so that an injury that is horrible to one person can be a minor discomfort to another .
psychological researchers are beginning to investigate why individual patients form the experience of pain differently when they experience similar tissue injury .
why seemingly healthy body areas can hurt persistently , and thereby disable a person , still eludes explanation .
some researchers are finding that long-lasting injury signals in neural pathways can change the way those pathways function , and over long periods of time , relentless signals of injury can even alter neural structures themselves .
the altered parts of the nervous system might keep generating injury messages , even after the original injury has healed .
other researchers apply the same principle to higher levels of the brain .
memory of tissue injury rather than new messages of injury might contribute to the formation of pain , and in this way the brain might continuously create pain in the absence of its original cause .
alternatively , the brain might turn minor signaling of tissue injury into a major pain by mixing cognitive and emotional memories into the formation of the pain experience .
research on pain is progressing on many fronts .
perhaps the most challenging is that of understanding how the brain integrates sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes when an injury occurs to form the complex bodily awareness that we know as pain .
unlocking this secret may help doctors prevent , treat , or eliminate some chronic pain disorders .

why do jews succeed ?
simon kuznets , one of the twentieth century ’ s great economists , was a pioneer of human-capital theory . not long before he died , kuznets recommended to a young colleague that one ought study the role of jews in economic life .
by and large , economists and other social scientists have neglected the history of jews and capitalism , for reasons that are understandable , though unconvincing . for most economists , the extent to which modern capitalism has been shaped by earlier cultural predispositions is a source of puzzlement at best , if not merely a factor to be dismissed .
when economists examine “ human capital , ” they prefer measurable criteria such as years of schooling . to the extent that human capital involves character traits and varieties of “ know-how ” that are transmitted within the realms of the family and the community , rather than by formal education , it becomes both method@@ ologically elusive and difficult to manipulate by public policy .
a look at the historical experience of the jews shows that while most jews were mired in poverty at the beginning of the twentieth century , over time they tended to do disproportionately well in societies that allowed them to compete on an equal basis . that was the case first in central and western europe , and then in the united states .
in search of economic niches not already occupied by others , jews frequently created markets for new products and services . they pioneered new retail institutions , from department stores to box stores .
the fact that jews were long a minority subject to discrimination is sometimes given as a reason for their tendency to devote themselves to commerce , finance , and the professions . yet not all minorities long subject to discrimination necessarily succeed under conditions of market competition .
there are a number of ways to account for jews ’ disproportionate achievement . for one thing , jews had more experience with commerce than most other groups , and the tacit knowledge of buying , selling , and calculating advantage that was passed on in families with ties to business helps explain why jews tended to be better at it .
moreover , in much of europe , jews had long been excluded from most of the established economy of land ownership , and from many other fields that were reserved for christians . so they learned to be on the lookout for new opportunities in underserved markets , working as peddlers , for example , or creating new products , or new forms of marketing .
jews were spread across many countries , but to some extent shared a common language and a sense of common fate . so they were more aware of distant opportunities , had more international contacts , and were disproportionately active in international trade .
in addition , jews had a religious culture that promoted universal adult literacy – at least for men – and a culture that respected book learning . those attitudes and dispositions were transferred from religious texts to secular forms of education .
such factors provide a sense of why attention to the history of jews under capitalism helps us to understand capitalism more generally . it reminds us that much of success in a capitalist society is based on cultural and historical factors that produce qualities such as innovativeness , willingness to tolerate risk , and willingness to defer gratification through savings and education .
these cultural traits are difficult to quantify , so economists are uncomfortable in dealing with them . they are often passed down within families , so they elude social policies that are based on the notion that equality of opportunity can be created by government action .
exploring the economic history of the jews also reminds us that groups that are disproportionately successful are met by different political reactions . societies long oriented to economic dynamism tend to welcome the economically successful , viewing them as a source of mutual gains .
but cultures that tend to resent the economically successful – either as an affront to equality , or on the implicit assumption that the economic gains of some must be at the expense of others – tend to be more hostile toward jews and given to conspiratorial theories to explain their economic success . most societies lie somewhere along a spectrum between these two poles .

why do smart people live longer ?
edinburgh – people with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adulthood tend to live longer .
this result has been found among people from australia , denmark , england and wales , scotland , sweden , and the united states . in fact , it has been found within every population that has been studied .
indeed , the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well-known risk factors for illness and death , such as high blood pressure , being overweight , high blood glucose , and high cholesterol .
its effect is almost as important as that of smoking .
differences in human intelligence have environmental and genetic causes .
an intelligence test score in early life is partly a record of what the environment has wrought on the brain and the rest of the body up to that time .
babies who have lower birth weights , for example , are more prone to chronic illnesses later in life .
they also have , on average , slightly lower intelligence .
but tests of whether birth weight might explain some of the link between intelligence and mortality have found no connection .
parents ’ occupations are also related to their child ’ s intelligence and later risk of illness : children from more privileged backgrounds tend to have higher intelligence and better health , and to live longer .
however , there is no convincing evidence that parental background explains the link between higher intelligence and longer life .
other researchers have viewed intelligence test scores as possibly more than just an indicator of an efficient brain .
after all , the brain is just one organ of the body , so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others ’ .
but this “ system integrity ” idea is somewhat vague and difficult to test .
the best we have done to date has been to examine whether people ’ s reaction speeds are related to intelligence and to mortality .
they are .
reaction-@@ time tests involve little thinking , and merely ask people to respond as fast as they can to simple stimuli .
people who react faster have , on average , higher intelligence scores and live longer .
but we need to think of better measures of the body ’ s integrity to test this idea more fully .
a third potential explanation is that intelligence is about good decision-making .
every day , as we live our lives , we make decisions about our health : what , when , and how much to eat ; how much exercise to take ; how to look after ourselves if we have an illness ; and so forth .
therefore , the reason that intelligence and death are linked might be that people with higher intelligence in childhood make better decisions about health , and have healthier behaviors .
as adults , they tend to have better diets , exercise more , gain less weight , have fewer hangovers , and so on .
so far , so good .
but we do not yet have the full story .
there have not been any studies with data on childhood intelligence , lots of subsequent data on adult health behaviors , and then a long-term follow-up for deaths .
and only such a study could tell us whether it is these healthy behaviors that explain the link between intelligence and death .
a fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to attain better educational qualifications , work in more professional jobs , have higher incomes , and live in more affluent areas .
these variables are related to living longer , too .
so , perhaps that ’ s it : higher intelligence buys people into safer and more health-@@ friendly environments .
certainly , in some studies , social class in adulthood seems to explain a lot of the link between intelligence and death .
the problem is that this “ explanation ” is statistical .
we are still not sure whether , say , education and occupation “ explain ” the effect of intelligence on health , or whether they are , in effect , merely surrogate measures of intelligence .
researchers have also searched for clues about the intelligence-@@ mortality link in specific types of death .
this has been revealing .
lower intelligence in early life is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from , for example , cardiovascular disease , accidents , suicide , and homicide .
the evidence for cancer is less certain .
as we have come across these specific findings , we have realized that each link might need a different explanation .
finally , we know that how intelligent we are and how long we shall live are caused by both environmental and genetic influences .
there are experimental designs , using twins , that can find out the extent to which intelligence and mortality are linked because they share environmental and genetic influences .
among the most informative exercises we can undertake in cognitive epidemiology is to obtain a large group of twins on whom there is data on early-@@ life intelligence and who were tracked for a long time to find out who had died .
we haven ’ t yet come across a large enough group of twins with such data .
finding one is a priority .
the ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer .
once we know that , we will be able to share and apply that knowledge with the aim of achieving optimal health for all .

growth out of time
cambridge – robert gordon of northwestern university is a distinguished economist whose work in macroeconomics and studies of long-term economic growth have properly earned him high regard .
so his recent exercise in speculative future history , which asks whether economic growth in the united states has come to an end , has attracted much favorable attention .
but a basic flaw in gordon ’ s argument is immediately apparent – and becomes glaringly so on closer examination .
the core of his article contrasts the transformational impact of ir # 1 and , especially , ir # 2 on per capita gdp and the quality of life with the relatively trivial consequences of ir # 3 .
the vulnerability of gordon ’ s argument is his shortened time horizon for ir # 3 . consider the following four sentences in his paper :
· “ both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy . ”
· “ at a minimum , it took 150 years for ir # 1 to have its full range of effects . ”
· “ the inventions of ir # 2 were so important … that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect . ”
· “ … &#91; t &#93; he productivity impact of ir # 3 evaporated after only eight years , compared to the 81 years ( 1891-1972 ) required for the benefits of ir # 2 to have their full impact … ”
the last sentence is crucial : gordon cuts off ir # 3 circa 2005 – that is , 45 years from its onset , but less than half the time allowed for ir # 1 and ir # 2 to run their respective courses .
to take a salient example from the prior industrial revolutions , this is as if the impact of the railroads on the us economy were to be measured as of 1873 , 45 years after construction began on america ’ s first line , the baltimore &amp; ohio .
in 1873 , the retailer montgomery ward was just a year old , and the first sears roebuck catalogue was still 20 years away .
together , these companies invented mail order as the “ killer app ” of the railroad age , creating a continental market for consumer goods , with all of the economies of scale that followed .
or , to take another example , what if we stopped measuring the economic impact of electrification only 45 years after the first generating plant , thomas edison ’ s pearl street station , became operational in 1882 ? at that point , america ’ s manufacturing industries were just discovering the benefits of flexible ( re ) configuration , which enabled distribution of generated electric power , while america ’ s home-@@ appliance industry was in its infancy .
gordon asserts that “ the era of computers replacing human labor was largely over ” during the past decade .
innovation in information and communications technology ( ict ) focused first on electronic commerce , “ itself largely completed by 2005 . ” after that , “ labor-saving innovation ” took a back seat to “ a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before , but now in smaller and more convenient packages . ”
in thus trun@@ cating and trivializing the ongoing ict revolution , gordon misses two fundamental processes .
first , and most evident , the rise of e-commerce is far from over . in the us , the most advanced country in this respect , e-commerce has just reached 10 % of total retail spending , and is continuing to grow at double-digit rates through the slow recovery from the great recession .
from the early days of the computer revolution , researchers and popularizers envisioned “ artificial intelligence ” as the ultimate killer app ( literally , in the case of the computer hal in the film 2001 : a space odyssey ) .
decades of frustration are now yielding to success : the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called big data that the internet simultaneously generates and captures .
for proof of artificial intelligent “ life , ” consider the “ virtual assistants ” populating smart phones , beginning – but just beginning – with apple ’ s siri .
the next wave of ir # 3 ’ s consequences can be discerned in systems that capture the intention behind a search request and couple it to a completed transaction , and in the application of predictive analytics to industrial supply chains and service provisioning .
if these innovations ’ prospective impact on productivity and gdp growth cannot be quantified , well , that is the way it is with future history .
flawed as gordon ’ s reading of ir # 3 is , his concluding concern for the future of innovation in the us is well founded .
of the assorted “ headwinds ” that he cites , the enormous increase in inequality and the plateau reached in educational attainment represent threats that differentiate america ’ s position from that of other advanced countries .
but gordon ignores the greatest threat to continued us global leadership in innovation : the delegitimation over the past generation of the state ’ s role as an economic actor .
as i illustrate and analyze at length in my new book , doing capitalism in the innovation economy : markets , speculation and the state , the state has become central to the innovation economy ’ s dynamics .
it funds the upstream research that generates discovery and invention ; supports the creation of new networks , from canals to the internet ; and serves as a creative customer for innovative products , as it did during the computer revolution ’ s nas@@ cence .
the state must also preserve continuity in the market economy when the speculative bubble that has funded its transformation bursts .
and here , too , gordon disappoints .
the only reference to government in his paper is not even to this stabilizing role . rather , it is to the asserted headwind represented by the very debt incurred to prevent the global financial crisis of 2008 from triggering a second great depression .

the truth about sovereignty
cambridge – in the french parliament ’ s recent debate on europe ’ s new fiscal treaty , the country ’ s socialist government vehemently denied that ratification of the treaty would undermine french sovereignty .
it places “ not one constraint on the level of public spending , ” jean-marc ayrault , the prime minister , asserted . “ budget sovereignty remains in the parliament of the french republic . ”
as ayrault was trying to reassure his skeptical colleagues , including many members of his own party , european commissioner for competition joaquin almunia was delivering a similar message to his fellow social democrats in brussels .
to succeed , he argued , europe must prove wrong those who believe there is a conflict between globalization and sovereignty .
nobody likes to give up national sovereignty , least of all , it seems , politicians on the left .
yet , by denying the obvious fact that the eurozone ’ s viability depends on substantial restraints on sovereignty , europe ’ s leaders are misleading their voters , delaying the europeanization of democratic politics , and raising the political and economic costs of the ultimate reckoning .
the eurozone aspires to full economic integration , which entails the elimination of transaction costs that impede cross-border commerce and finance .
obviously , it requires that governments renounce direct restrictions on trade and capital flows .
but it also requires that they harmonize their domestic rules and regulations – such as product-safety standards and bank regulations – with those of other member states in order to ensure they do not act as indirect trade barriers . and governments must forswear changes in these policies , lest the uncertainty itself act as a transaction cost .
this was all implicit in the european union ’ s single-market initiative .
the eurozone went one step further , aiming through monetary unification to eradicate fully the transaction costs associated with national currencies and exchange-rate risk .
simply put , the european integration project has hinged on restrictions on national sovereignty .
if its future is now in doubt , it is because sovereignty stands in the way once again .
in a true economic union , underpinned by union-wide political institutions , the financial problems of greece , spain , and the others would not have blown up to their current proportions , threatening the existence of the union itself .
consider the united states .
no one even keeps track of , say , florida ’ s current-account deficit with the rest of the country , although we can safely guess that it is huge ( since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere ) .
when florida ’ s state government goes bankrupt , florida ’ s banks continue to operate normally , because they are under federal rather than state jurisdiction .
when florida ’ s banks go belly-up , state finances are insulated , because the banks are ultimately the responsibility of federal institutions .
when florida ’ s workers become unemployed , they get unemployment checks from washington , dc .
and when florida ’ s voters are disenchanted about the economy , they do not riot outside the state capital ; they put pressure on their representatives in congress to push for changes in federal policies .
nobody would argue that us states have an abundance of sovereignty .
the relationship between sovereignty and democracy is also misunderstood .
not all restrictions on the exercise of sovereign power are undemocratic .
political scientists talk about “ democratic delegation ” – the idea that a sovereign might want to tie its hands ( through international commitments or delegation to autonomous agencies ) in order to achieve better outcomes .
the delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank is the archetypal example : in the service of price stability , daily management of monetary policy is insulated from politics .
even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance , there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so .
in domestic politics , delegation is carefully calibrated and restricted to a few areas where the issues tend to be highly technical and partisan differences are not large .
a truly democracy-@@ enhancing globalization would respect these boundaries .
it would impose only those limits that are consistent with democratic delegation , possibly along with a limited number of procedural norms ( such as transparency , accountability , representativeness , use of scientific evidence , etc . ) that enhance democratic deliberation at home .
as the american example illustrates , it is possible to give up on sovereignty – as florida , texas , california , and the other us states have done – without giving up on democracy .
but combining market integration with democracy requires the creation of supranational political institutions that are representative and accountable .
the conflict between democracy and globalization becomes acute when globalization restricts the domestic articulation of policy preferences without a compensating expansion of democratic space at the regional / global level .
europe is already on the wrong side of this boundary , as the political unrest in spain and greece indicates .
that is where my political trilemma begins to bite : we cannot have globalization , democracy , and national sovereignty simultaneously .
we must choose two among the three .
if european leaders want to maintain democracy , they must make a choice between political union and economic disintegration .
they must either explicitly renounce economic sovereignty or actively put it to use for the benefit of their citizens .
the first would entail coming clean with their own electorates and building democratic space above the level of the nation-state .
the second would mean giving up on monetary union in order to be able to deploy national monetary and fiscal policies in the service of longer-term recovery .
the longer this choice is postponed , the greater the economic and political cost that ultimately will have to be paid .

economic policy ’ s narrative imperative
the crisis faced by the european union and the eurozone is a telling example of the need for a narrative that explains public policy and generates political support for it .
a successful narrative can be neither too complicated nor simplistic .
it must capture the imagination , address the public ’ s anxieties , and generate realistic hope .
european central bank president mario draghi provided such a narrative to the financial markets last july .
he said that the ecb would do everything necessary to prevent the disintegration of the euro , adding simply : “ believe me , it will be enough . ”
with that sentence , draghi eliminated the perceived re-denomination tail risk that was highest in the case of greece , but that was driving up borrowing costs in spain , italy , and portugal as well .
it was not a populist message , because the ecb does indeed have the firepower to buy enough sovereign bonds on the secondary market to put a ceiling on interest rates , at least for many months .
central bankers , more generally , are typically able to provide short- or medium-term narratives to financial markets .
us federal reserve board chairman ben bernanke provided his own by pledging that us short-term interest rates would remain very low , and the bank of japan ’ s new chairman , haruhiko kuroda , has just provided another by saying that he will double the money supply so that inflation reaches 2 % .
while central bankers can provide such narratives to financial markets , it is political leaders who must provide the overall socioeconomic messages that encourage long-term real investment , electoral support for reform , and hope for the future .
central bank alchemy , to borrow a term from the us journalist neil irwin ’ s new book , has its limits .
europe , in particular , needs a narrative of long-term hope that will trigger a real recovery .
france is coming closer to the danger zone , and even germany ’ s annual gdp growth is falling well below 1 % per year .
in the meantime , the easing of sovereign interest-rate spreads provides little comfort to the growing army of unemployed in southern europe , where youth unemployment has reached dramatic heights – close to 60 % in greece and spain , and almost 40 % in italy .
the narrative should address three essential questions .
how can the european model of strong social solidarity and security be reformed , but endure ?
how can economic growth be revived and sustained throughout the eu ?
and how can europe ’ s institutions function with enhanced legitimacy to accommodate countries that share the euro and others that retain their national currencies ?
for starters , a revolution is required in the organization of work , learning , and leisure .
social solidarity , essential to european identity , can and must include longer work lives , but also more work-sharing , adult learning , and shorter average work weeks ( particularly close to retirement ) .
such flexibility requires the consent of all : employees must adjust to changing requirements ; employers must re-organize their enterprises to allow more work-sharing , work from home , and learning intervals ; and governments must overhaul taxes , income support , and regulation to promote a “ flex-@@ solidarity revolution ” that encourages personal choice and responsibility , while remaining committed to social cohesion .
this can lead to a better future for all , with citizens gaining better access to adult education , having more free time to pursue personal interests , and remaining productive and occup@@ ationally engaged far longer into their healthy lives .
europe does not need asia ’ s rates of economic growth .
it can secure decent jobs and prosperity , with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2 % .
to achieve that , german voters should be told not that their country ’ s resources will forever flow to spain , but that their wages can rise at twice the rate of the recent past without risking inflation or a current-account deficit , because germany has the world ’ s largest external surplus .
service-sector industries throughout the eu must be opened up .
the countries with stronger fiscal positions should take the lead in a major pan-european skill-@@ upgrading program .
the number of pan-european scholarships should be doubled .
school programs everywhere should aim to educate tri@@ lingual citizens .
moreover , a full european banking union with shared resources for resolution should be created without further delay .
the european investment bank , which received a significant capital increase in 2012 , should add a large investment-@@ support program for medium-size enterprises to its current operations , with a subsidy financed from the european budget to encourage first-time job takers for a limited period .
jobs and training for young people must be the centerpiece for the new growth pact , and projects must move ahead in “ crisis mode , ” rather than according to business as usual .
finally , while monetary union obviously requires greater sharing of sovereignty , there should also be a “ greater europe ” that includes the united kingdom and others .
this implies two-tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries : the “ euro-@@ ins ” and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values .
these interconnected visions can and must be realized if europe is to thrive again .
together , they form a compelling narrative that european leaders must begin to articulate .

brussels – at high-level gatherings of the european union elite , one often hears the following type of statement : “ europe must integrate and centralize economic governance in order to defend its social model in an age of globalization . ”
european commission president josé manuel barroso and his counterpart at the european council , herman van rompuy , are particularly keen on this argument .
but the claim that only deeper eu integration can save the “ european ” social model from the onslaught of emerging markets is not true .
yes , globalization represents a challenge to all eu member states ; but it is not clear how more integration would help them to confront it .
more european economic governance is not a panacea .
in fact , it is not even clear which european social model needs to be saved .
the common elements that are usually identified with the “ european ” social model are a quest for equality and a strong welfare state .
but neither of the main problems confronting europe ’ s social-security systems – slow economic growth and aging populations ( a function of low fertility ) – can be addressed at the european level .
this is obvious for fertility , which is determined by deeper social and demographic trends that cannot really be influenced by government action .
and , while aging could be transformed into an opportunity if the elderly could be made more productive , this requires action at the national and societal levels , not more european integration .
it is understandable that european leaders talk so much about globalization , given that the european economy is rather open for its size , with exports amounting to about 20 % of gdp , compared to just 12 % in the us .
the ( re- ) emergence of big economies like china is thus bound to have a greater impact on europe than on the us .
economists long ago recognized that it is theoretically possible that the emergence of new growth poles abroad does more harm than good to an economy .
this can happen if the new economic powers are more important as competitors than they are as customers .
but this does not seem to be the case , even with respect to china .
the eu does have a bilateral trade deficit with china , but it also exports a lot to the chinese market – much more than the us does .
more important , even if one accepts the view that globalization constitutes a threat to europe ’ s social model , there is little scope for further integration , given that trade policy is already fully unified at the eu level .
in any case , the eu has generally contributed constructively to all major rounds of global trade liberalization .
with the eu helping to keep global markets open , european exports have held up rather well , with the eu maintaining its market share .
although it has lost ground relative to the emerging markets ( especially china ) , it has far outperformed other developed economies like the us and japan .
this is true even in services , despite slow productivity growth in europe .
it is thus wrong to assume that economies based on cheap labor are massively outcompeting the eu .
moreover , this relatively good trade performance has been achieved with a much lower increase in wage inequality in europe than in the us .
the various european social models have thus been , on average , quite robust – most likely because of the absence of a master plan from brussels on how to respond to globalization . each member country has had to adapt in its own way , knowing that it could not bend the rules of the game in its own favor .
not all succeeded ; but the successes ( germany , for example ) far outweigh the failures ( see greece ) .
the key to ensuring the future of europe ’ s social-security systems , and thus its social model , is faster growth .
and , again , it is difficult to see how more europe would improve the situation .
the obstacles to growth are well known , and have existed for a long time without being removed .
the reason is quite simple : if there were a politically easy way to generate growth , it would have been implemented already .
moreover , most national policymakers have a tendency to blame “ brussels ” for all of their difficult choices , thus creating the impression at home that the economy would improve if economic affairs could be managed without eu interference .
more integration is preached at the european level , but implicitly portrayed at home as an obstacle to growth .
this double-speak on the part of national political elites is perceived as such by voters , whose trust in both national and eu institutions is naturally declining .
the claim that europe needs more integration to save its social model has long lost credibility .
integration is irrelevant to that question , and , in those areas where deeper integration really would benefit europe , it appears to be the last thing that national leaders want .

why eurobonds are un-american
brussels – the emerging consensus in europe nowadays is that only “ debt mutualization ” in the form of eurobonds can resolve the euro crisis , with advocates frequently citing the early united states , when alexander hamilton , president george washington ’ s treasury secretary , successfully pressed the new federal government to assume the revolutionary war debts of america ’ s states .
but a closer look reveals that this early us experience provides neither a useful analogy nor an encouraging precedent for eurobonds .
first , taking over a stock of existing state debt at the federal level is very different from allowing individual member states to issue bonds with “ joint and several ” liability underwritten by all member states collectively .
hamilton did not have to worry about moral hazard , because the federal government did not guarantee any new debt incurred by the states .
second , it is seldom mentioned that us federal debt at the time ( around $ 40 million ) was much larger than that of the states ( about $ 18 million ) .
thus , assuming state debt was not central to the success of post-war financial stabilization in the new country ; rather , it was a natural corollary of the fact that most of the debt had been incurred fighting for a common cause .
moreover , the most efficient sources of government revenues at the time were tariffs and taxes collected at the external border .
even from an efficiency point of view , it made sense to have the federal government service public debt .
federal assumption of the states ’ war debts also yielded an advantage in terms of economic development : once states no longer had any debt , they had no need to raise any revenues through direct taxation , which might have impeded the growth of america ’ s internal market .
indeed , after the federal government assumed the states ’ debt ( already a small part of the total ) , state revenues fell by 80-90 % .
the states then became for some time fiscally irrelevant .
finally , the key to the success of financial stabilization was a profound restructuring .
hamilton estimated that the federal government could raise enough revenues to pay approximately 4 % interest on the total amount of debt to be serviced – significantly less than the 6 % yield on the existing obligations .
holders of both state and federal bonds were thus offered a basket of long-dated bonds , some with an interest rate of 3 % , and others with 6 % ( with a ten-year grace period ) .
the basket was designed in such a way as to result in an average debt-service cost of 4 % .
in modern terms , the “ net present value ” of the total debt ( federal and state ) was reduced by about one-half if one were to apply the usual exit yield of 9 % .
moreover , the new federal bonds ’ very long maturities meant that there was no rollover risk .
it would have been very dangerous to expose the federal government to this danger , given that the operation was rightly perceived at the outset as extremely risky .
for the country ’ s first few years , debt service swallowed more than 80 % of all federal revenues .
the slightest negative shock could have bankrupted the new federal government .
fortunately , the opposite happened : federal revenues tripled under the impact of a rapid post-war reconstruction boom , and continued to grow rapidly , aided by the country ’ s ability to remain neutral while wars ravaged the european continent .
by contrast , growth prospects in europe today are rather dim , and interest payments , even for greece or italy , account for less than 20 % of total revenues .
the real problem is the rollover of existing debt in a stagnating economy .
for example , italy will soon have a balanced budget in structural terms , but must still face the problem of refinancing old debt as it matures each year .
assuaging doubt about the sustainability of public debt in the eurozone would thus probably require a deep restructuring as well .
the eurozone crisis could certainly be resolved if all existing public debt were transformed into 20-year eurobonds with a yield of 3 % , and a five-year grace period on debt service .
one can easily anticipate the impact that this would have on financial markets .
more interesting in view of the current situation in the eurozone is what followed roughly a half-century after hamilton acted .
in the 1830 ’ s and 1840 ’ s , a number of states had over-invested in the leading transport technology of the time – canals .
when the can@@ al-@@ building boom ended , eight states and the territory of florida ( accounting for about 10 % of the entire us population at the time ) were unable to service their debt and defaulted on their , mostly british , loans .
british bankers threatened that they would never again invest in these untrustworthy americans .
they could point to the precedent set by hamilton , and had probably invested on the implicit understanding that , if necessary , the federal government would bail out the states again .
but , despite foreign creditors ’ threats , the federal government did not come to the rescue .
the bailout request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states ( represented by the senate ) and the population ( represented by the house of representatives ) under the normal decision-making procedure ( the “ community method , ” in european union jargon ) .
the defaults proved to be costly .
the 1840 ’ s were a period of slow growth , and continued pressure from foreign creditors forced most of the official debtors to resume payments after a while .
default was not an easy way out , and all us states ( with the exception of vermont ) have since embraced balanced-budget amendments to their constitutions as a way to shore up their fiscal credibility .
are eu members prepared to take a similar step ?

the world bank , the open society institute , and the european commission are co-sponsoring a conference , roma in an expanding europe : challenges for the future , from june 30-@@ july 1 in budapest , with the government of hungary as host .
here , the president of the world bank and the chairman of the osi discuss the problems that must be addressed .
too often in the countries of central and eastern europe , roma teens and children spend their days at the garbage dump .
unable to afford school , they scavenge for paper and other scraps for recycling , earning just enough to eat .
too often roma families live in tiny cramped wooden or tin shacks with no power or running water and dim prospects for the future .
a similar picture , though on a smaller scale , exists in many european union member countries that are home to roma minorities .
a wide socioeconomic disparity exists between europe &apos;s majority population and roma , or &quot; gypsies &quot; , many of whom live in extreme poverty .
left unchanged , this persistent poverty threatens to become a permanent drag on european prosperity , which would be a tragedy for roma and non-roma alike .
the situation of the 7-9 million roma living on the continent deserves the urgent attention of government leaders as they shape the policies of an enlarged eu .
roma are the continent &apos;s fastest growing and most vulnerable minority .
boosting their prospects will be crucial to sustained prosperity on the continent , and will require implementing inclusive policies to ensure that roma enjoy the post-@@ transition benefits of open , free-market economies .
indeed , roma have been among the biggest losers in the transition from communism since 1989 .
they were often the first to lose their jobs in the early 1990 &apos;s , and they have been persistently blocked from re@@ entering the labor force due to their often inadequate skills and pervasive discrimination .
even in the more prosperous countries of central and eastern europe , roma poverty is strikingly high-@@ -@@ sometimes more than ten times that of non-roma .
while accession countries such as hungary , the czech republic , and slovakia have made impressive progress in economic and political transformation during the 1990 &apos;s , dealing with the plight of the roma remains one of the most critical issues on their path to eu membership next year and over the next decade .
in 2000 , nearly 80 % of roma in bulgaria and romania were living on less than $ 4.@@ 30 per day , in comparison with 37 % of the total population of bulgaria and 30 % in romania .
in better-off hungary , 40 % of roma were living on incomes below this level , compared with 7 % of the non-roma population .
poverty , combined with higher birth rates , means that the magnitude of roma hardship will grow in coming years .
roughly 25-30 % of roma are under 15 years of age , in contrast with 10 % of the majority population .
high unemployment , particularly among young people , locks roma in a vicious cycle of impoverishment and exclusion , further driving down living standards and leaving many in marginalized settlements without access to electricity , clean water , or other basic utilities .
lack of education keeps roma out of work and limits their future opportunities .
an estimated 600,000 roma children of primary school age living in the eu accession countries are not attending school at all .
of those that go , most do not complete primary school , and less than 1 % across central and eastern europe go on to higher education .
many students who are in class are stuck in inferior segregated schools .
others are wrongly placed in schools for the mentally and physically disabled , merely because they had no access to preschool , or because they do not speak the majority language .
nonetheless , there is reason for optimism .
over the past decade , a range of initiatives have been launched to keep roma children in school , expand access to jobs , and overcome discrimination .
while such interventions by governments , non-government groups and international agencies have helped , the time has now come to scale up the effort .
most importantly , a small but growing core of experienced and dedicated young roma leaders is emerging who can work both within their communities and with governments to overcome poverty and discrimination .
at the end of this month , many of these young people will join us in budapest , along with prime ministers and other senior officials from central and eastern european countries and eu member states .
for the first time , government and roma leaders will tackle the roma issue as a core social and economic concern .
such an integrated policy approach is needed to ensure that the basic rights of roma are truly realized in an expanded europe .
we cannot afford to leave the roma behind .

why fair trade ?
london – historically , the term “ fair trade ” has meant many things .
the fair trade league was founded in britain in 1881 to restrict imports from foreign countries .
in the united states , businesses and labor unions use “ fair trade ” laws to construct what economist joseph stiglitz calls “ barbed-wire barriers to imports . ”
these so called “ anti-dumping ” laws allow a company that suspects a foreign rival of selling a product below cost to request that the government impose special tariffs to protect it from “ unfair ” competition .
such dark protectionist thoughts are far from the minds of the benevolent organizers of the united kingdom ’ s annual “ fairtrade fortnight , ” during which i just bought two bars of fair-trade chocolate and a jar of fair-trade chunky peanut butter .
their worthy aim is to raise the price paid to developing-country farmers for their produce by excluding the inflated profits of the middlemen on whom they depend for getting their goods to distant markets .
fair-trade products like cocoa , coffee , tea , and bananas do not compete with domestic european production , and therefore do not have a protectionist motive .
this is how it works : in exchange for being paid a guaranteed price and meeting “ agreed labor and environmental standards ” ( minimum wages , no pesticides ) , poor-country farming cooperatives receive a fairtrade mark for their products , issued by the fairtrade labeling organization .
this certification enables supermarkets and other retailers to sell the products at a premium .
third-world farmers get a boost to their income , while first-world consumers get to feel virtuous : a marriage made in heaven .
the fair-trade movement , launched in the 1980 ’ s , has been growing rapidly .
in a notable breakthrough in 1997 , the british house of commons decided to serve only fair-trade coffee .
by the end of 2007 , more than 600 producers ’ organizations , representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries , were selling fair-trade products .
today , a quarter of all bananas in uk supermarkets are sold under a fairtrade mark .
but fairtrade-@@ labeled products still represent a very small share – typically less than 1 % – of global sales of cocoa , tea , coffee , etc .
the economic rationale for guaranteed prices is well known : stabilizing the prices of primary products , which are subject to sharp fluctuations , stabilizes their producers ’ incomes .
this argument inspired proposals – most famously by john maynard keynes in 1942 – to create “ buffer stocks ” for the main commodities , which would take supply off the market when prices fell , and add to supply when prices rose .
keynes ’ s proposal never made it into the bretton woods agreement of 1944 , and , while buffer@@ -@@ stock schemes re-@@ surfaced in the 1970 ’ s , they , too , went nowhere .
left-wing economists like raúl prebisch , moreover , later advanced the theory of “ declining terms of trade ” for primary products : their prices ’ long-run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods .
this tendency seemed to be at work from the mid-1980 ’ s , as commodity producers experienced a persistent decline in prices .
in addition , price fluctuations throughout that decade were huge , with dire effects on sub-saharan african and other developing countries that were largely dependent on commodities for export earnings .
since then , however , the price decline has been reversed .
food commodity prices have increased by 150 % since 2001 .
this has raised farm producers ’ income independently of the fair-trade movement ’ s efforts .
the “ declining terms of trade ” argument has collapsed .
but primary-@@ product prices remain much more volatile than the prices of manufactured goods and services , causing large fluctuations in producers ’ incomes .
this exaggerates the effects of booms and busts .
so the issue of price stabilization has not gone away .
it is difficult to see how the fair-trade movement can contribute much to solving this problem , because the only serious policy for stabilizing producers ’ incomes is to control supply .
but that is beyond the scope of fair trade .
the target of all versions of fair trade is “ free trade , ” and the most damaging attacks on fairtrade have come from free traders .
in unfair trade , a pamphlet published in 2008 by the adam smith institute , mark sidwell argues that fairtrade keeps uncompetitive farmers on the land , holding back diversification and mechanization .
according to sidwell , the fairtrade scheme turns developing countries into low-@@ profit , labor-intensive agrarian ghettos , denying future generations the chance of a better life .
this is without considering the effect that fairtrade has on the poorest people in these countries – not farmers but casual laborers – who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards .
in other words , fairtrade protects farmers against their rivals and against agricultural laborers .
consumers , sidwell argues , are also being duped .
only a tiny proportion – as little as 1 % – of the premium that we pay for a fairtrade chocolate bar will ever make it to cocoa producers .
nor is fairtrade necessarily a guarantee of quality : because producers get a minimum price for fair-trade goods , they sell the best of their crop on the open market .
but , despite its shaky economics , the fair-trade movement should not be despised .
while cynics say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purchases – rather like buying indulgences in the old catholic church – this is to sell fair trade short .
in fact , the movement represents a spark of protest against mindless consumerism , grass-roots resistance against an impersonal logic , and an expression of communal activism .
that justification will not convince economists , who prefer a dr@@ yer sort of reasoning .
but it is not out of place to remind ourselves that economists and bureaucrats need not always have things their own way .

why finance can save the planet
paris – most people hate finance , viewing it as the epitome of irresponsibility and greed .
but , even after causing a once-in-a-century recession and unemployment for millions , finance looks indispensable for preventing an even worse catastrophe : climate change .
action is urgently needed to contain global warming and prevent a disaster for humanity ; yet the global community is desperately short of tools .
there is not much support for the most desirable solutions advocated by economists , such as a global cap on greenhouse-gas emissions , coupled with a trading system , or the enforcement of a worldwide carbon price through a global tax on co2 emissions .
instead , negotiations for the united nations climate change conference in paris in december are being conducted on the basis of voluntary , unilateral pledges called intended nationally determined contributions .
although the inclusion of voluntary targets has the merit of creating global momentum , this approach is unlikely to result in commitments that are both binding and commensurate to the challenge .
that is why climate advocates are increasingly looking for other means of triggering action .
finance is at the top of their list .
for starters , finance provides an accurate yardstick to gauge if deeds are consistent with words .
in 2011 , “ unburnable carbon , ” a path-breaking report by the nongovernmental carbon tracker initiative , showed that the proven fossil-fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exceed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees celsius .
reserves held just by the 200 top publicly listed fuel companies – thus excluding state-owned producers such as saudi arabia ’ s aramco – exceed this carbon budget by one-third .
and that means that these companies ’ stock-market valuation is inconsistent with containing global warning .
this realization prompted a campaign to convince investors to divest from carbon-rich assets .
individuals and institutions representing a $ 2.6 trillion portfolio have already joined the divestment movement .
furthermore , bank of england governor mark carney has highlighted the threat represented by potentially stranded carbon assets .
investors are being warned that , from the standpoint of financial stability , “ brown ” securities bear specific risk .
the amount of divestment may look big – and it is , particularly given that the campaign started recently .
yet $ 2.6 trillion amounts to less than 5 % of global private non-financial securities .
the trend is real , but it is still too little to trigger significant changes in fossil-fuel companies ’ valuation and behavior .
a second reason why finance matters is that the transition to a low-carbon economy requires huge investments .
according to the international energy agency , global investment in energy supply currently amounts to $ 1.6 trillion annually , and 70 % of it is still based on oil , coal , or gas .
green investment amounts to only 15 % of the total , and investment in energy efficiency – in buildings , transport , and industry – totals a meager $ 130 billion .
containing the increase in average surface temperature to two degrees requires developing clean technologies , and even more important , a four-fold increase in investment in energy efficiency over the next ten years .
yet such investment will not be financed easily : its return depends on a still-@@ elusive carbon price and will often materialize only in the long run , while improving energy efficiency implies replacing hundreds of millions of outdated vehicles and refitting hundreds of millions of energy-@@ voracious buildings .
adequate financing instruments are required for the right purpose at the right place and at the right scale .
development banks and green banks have a huge role to play .
for example , dedicated long-term loans , coupled with a tax break or a subsidy , would help households decide to modernize their homes .
but the real hope among climate specialists is that innovative finance could help provide the planning clarity that is currently missing .
to elicit the investments that are necessary to mitigate climate change and green the economy , the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a credible , fast-rising path for the price of carbon are vital .
but , because high fuel prices are unpopular with consumers and raise competitiveness concerns among businesses , governments are reluctant to take action today – and may renege on their commitments to act tomorrow .
to overcome such trepidation , advocates for climate action are turning to incentives .
some have recommended that governments issue co2 performance bonds , whose yield would be reduced if companies exceed their carbon target .
another idea , put forward in a recent paper by michel aglietta and his colleagues , is to map out a path for an indicative price of carbon called its “ social value ” and provide green project developers a government-guaranteed carbon certificate representing the value of the corresponding emissions reduction .
central banks , they suggest , would then refinance loans to such developers , up to the value of the carbon certificate .
this would amount to a calculated bet .
if the price of carbon in , say , ten years , actually corresponds to the announced social value , the project will be profitable and the developer will repay the loan .
but if the government reneges on its commitment , the developer will default , leaving the central bank with a claim on the government .
failure to increase the price of carbon would result either in higher public debt or , in the case of monetization , inflation .
the idea is to force governments to have skin in the game , by balancing the risk of inaction on the carbon tax with the risk of insolvency or inflation .
there would be no procrastination .
action against global warming would take place without delay .
but a decade or so later , governments – and societies more broadly – would need to choose between taxation , debt , and inflation .
undertaking massive investment now and deciding only later how to finance it looks irresponsible – and so it is .
but not acting at all would be even more irresponsible .

why financial pay shouldn ’ t be left to the market
cambridge – although some financial firms are reforming how they pay their employees , governments around the world are seriously considering regulating such firms ’ compensation structures .
the basel committee on banking supervision has recently come out in favor of such regulations , and the united states house of representatives has voted to require regulators to set compensation rules .
perhaps not surprisingly , many financial bosses are up in arms over such moves .
they claim that they need the freedom to set compensation packages in order to keep their most talented people – the ones who will revive the world ’ s financial system .
so , should governments step back and let financial firms reform themselves ?
the answer is clearly no .
in the post-crisis financial order , governments must take on the role of monitoring and regulating pay in financial firms ; otherwise , the perverse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily recur .
it is important to distinguish between two sources of concern about pay in financial firms .
one set of concerns arises from the perspective of shareholders .
figures recently released by new york ’ s attorney general , andrew cuomo , indicate that nine large financial firms paid their employees aggregate compensation exceeding $ 600 billion in 2003-2008 – a period in which their aggregate market capitalization substantially declined .
such patterns may raise concerns among shareholders that pay structures are not well designed to serve their interests .
even if financial firms have governance problems that produce pay decisions deviating from shareholder interests , however , such problems do not necessarily warrant government regulation of those decisions .
such problems are best addressed by rules that focus on improving internal governance processes and strengthening investors ’ rights , leaving the choices that determine compensation structures to corporate boards and the shareholders who elect them .
but pay in financial firms also raises a second important source of concern : even if compensation structures are designed in the interests of shareholders , they may produce incentives for excessive risk-taking that are socially undesirable .
as a result , even if corporate governance problems in financial firms are fully addressed , a government role in regulating their compensation structures may still be warranted .
suppose that most financial firms could be relied upon by regulators to be run in the interest of their shareholders .
would this justify exempting these firms from existing regulations that constrain their decisions with respect to lending , investment , or capital reserves ?
clearly not , because shareholders do not bear the full costs of a firm ’ s collapse , and , as the recent crisis demonstrates , the bill for such a downfall must be picked up , at least in part , by taxpayers and the economy .
so shareholders ’ interests might sometimes be served by business decisions that are too “ risky , ” and regulating such decisions is justified – indeed , necessary .
regulation of pay in financial firms is called for by the same reasons that justify the traditional regulations of the firms ’ business decisions .
the incentives generated by compensation structures determine how firms ’ managers behave within the boundaries permitted by such traditional , direct regulations .
and as traditional regulation of business decisions is bound to be imperfect , regulating compensation structures can be a useful additional tool to control the risks posed by financial firms ’ behavior .
if choices of compensation structures can be expected to affect financial firms ’ stability , regulating these choices can also be useful for protecting this stability .
financial firms opposed to pay regulation will likely warn against “ micro-@@ managing ” compensation , and argue that compensation choices must take into account information about each individual manager that regulators are almost certain to lack .
but pay regulation can improve matters without micro-management by setting general standards from which firms may not deviate but that still leave them with significant freedom to account for the individual circumstances of managers .
for example , regulatory standards could require equity-based plans to preclude managers from cashing out awarded shares and options during a certain minimum period after vesting .
in such a case , firms could still remain free to choose the number of shares and options awarded to any given manager , as well as to adjust somewhat the length of the post-@@ vesting period during which cashing out would be precluded .
finally , those opposing pay regulation are certain to warn us about “ unintended consequences . ”
but this warning should not carry the day .
we have experienced over the last several years the real and costly consequences of a compensation regime that left financial firms free to set their own pay structures .
are we to believe that those consequences are preferable to the unintended consequences of pay regulation ?
the effort to avoid the harm of flawed compensation decisions in the future should not be deterred by speculative arguments about unintended consequences .
financial firms should not retain the freedom to create perverse incentives that put all of us at risk .

banking reform ’ s fear factor
washington , dc – nearly five years after the worst financial crisis since the 1930 ’ s , and three years after the enactment of the dodd-frank financial reforms in the united states , one question is on everyone ’ s mind : why have we made so little progress ?
new rules have been promised , but very few have actually been implemented .
there is not yet a “ volcker rule ” ( limiting proprietary trading by banks ) , the rules for derivatives are still a work-in-progress , and money-market funds remain unreformed .
even worse , our biggest banks have become even larger .
there is no sign that they have abandoned the incentive structure that encourages excessive risk-taking .
and the great distortions from being “ too big to fail ” loom large over many economies .
there are three possible explanations for what has gone wrong . one is that financial reform is inherently complicated .
but , though many technical details need to be fleshed out , some of the world ’ s smartest people work in the relevant regulatory agencies .
they are more than capable of writing and enforcing rules – that is , when this is what they are really asked to do .
the second explanation focuses on conflict among agencies with overlapping jurisdictions , both within and across countries .
again , there is an element of truth to this ; but we have also seen a great deal of coordination even on the most complex topics – such as how much equity big banks should have , or how the potential failure of such a firm should be handled .
that leaves the final explanation : those in charge of financial reform really did not want to make rapid progress .
in both the us and europe , government leaders are gripped by one overriding fear : that their economies will slip back into recession – or worse .
the big banks play on this fear , arguing that financial reform will cause them to become unprofitable and make them unable to lend , or that there will be some other dire unintended consequence .
there has been a veritable avalanche of lobbying on this point , which has resulted in top officials moving slowly , for fear of damaging the economy .
but this is a grave mistake – based on a failure to understand how big banks can damage the economy .
higher equity-capital requirements , for example , require banks to fund themselves with relatively more equity and relatively less debt .
this makes them safer , because they are more able to absorb losses , and less likely to become zombie banks ( which do not make sensible loans ) .
the banks claim that higher capital requirements and other regulations will drive up the cost of credit .
but there is no sign of any such effect – a point made , rather belatedly , in the federal reserve ’ s monetary policy report to the us congress last week .
on the contrary , the biggest us banks are reporting very healthy profits for the last quarter .
unfortunately , a big part of these banks ’ profits stems from trading securities – exactly the sort of high-risk activity that got them into trouble in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis .
these are highly leveraged businesses , typically funding their balance sheets with no more than 5 % equity ( and thus 95 % debt ) .
to understand why this is a problem , consider what happens when you buy a house with just 5 % down ( or less than 3 % down , which is a better analogy for some european banks ) .
if house prices go up , you make a good return on your equity ( and a better return than if you had put 20 % down ) .
but if house prices go down , your equity may well be wiped out ( which is what it means to be underwater on your mortgage ) .
higher equity-capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy – they make financial crises ( and the zombie-@@ syndrome ) less likely , less severe , or both .
us banks are currently funded with more equity than was the case before the financial crisis , and they are doing fine .
nonetheless , we should still worry about their ability to blow themselves up in a novel and creative fashion – hence the need for the volcker rule , derivatives reform , and new rules for money-market funds .
and equity-capital requirements for large , systemically important financial institutions remain too low .
the latest indications are that us policymakers are finally starting to focus on this point .
many european banks , however , have less equity than their us counterparts , which creates an important source of vulnerability going forward .
if there is to be a broad-based european recovery , the banks must raise more equity , thereby strengthening their ability to absorb potential losses .
unfortunately , there is little sign that european policymakers understand this point .
instead , senior officials in europe think and talk like us policymakers did three years ago .
they are wary of rocking the financial boat , so they go easy on financial reform and refuse to insist on more equity capital for banks .
this is a mistake that they – and possibly all of us – may come to regret .

models behaving badly
london – “ why did no one see the crisis coming ? ” queen elizabeth ii asked economists during a visit to the london school of economics at the end of 2008 .
four years later , the repeated failure of economic forecasters to predict the depth and duration of the slump would have elicited a similar question from the queen : why the overestimate of recovery ?
in its 2011 forecast , the international monetary fund predicted that the european economy would grow by 2.1 % in 2012 .
in fact , it looks certain to shrink this year by 0.2 % .
in the united kingdom , the 2010 forecast of the office for budget responsibility ( obr ) projected 2.6 % growth in 2011 and 2.8 % growth in 2012 ; in fact , the uk economy grew by 0.9 % in 2011 and will flat-line in 2012 .
the oecd ’ s latest forecast for eurozone gdp in 2012 is 2.3 % lower than its projection in 2010 .
likewise , the imf now predicts that the european economy will be 7.8 % smaller in 2015 than it thought just two years ago .
some forecasters are more pessimistic than others ( the obr has a particularly sunny disposition ) , but no one , it seems , has been pessimistic enough .
economic forecasting is necessarily imprecise : too many things happen for forecasters to be able to foresee all of them .
so judgment calls and best guesses are an inevitable part of “ scientific ” economic forecasts .
but imprecision is one thing ; the systematic overestimate of the economic recovery in europe is quite another .
indeed , the figures have been repeatedly revised , even over quite short periods of time , casting strong doubt on the validity of the economic models being used .
these models , and the institutions using them , rely on a built-in theory of the economy , which enables them to “ assume ” certain relationships .
two key mistakes stand out .
the models used by all of the forecasting organizations dramatically underestimated the fiscal multiplier : the impact of changes in government spending on output .
second , they overestimated the extent to which quantitative easing ( qe ) by the monetary authorities – that is , printing money – could counterbalance fiscal tightening .
until recently , the obr , broadly in line with the imf , assumed a fiscal multiplier of 0.6 : for every dollar cut from government spending , the economy would shrink by only 60 cents .
this assumes “ ricardian equivalence ” : debt-financed public spending at least partly crowds out private spending through its impact on expectations and confidence .
if households and firms anticipate a tax increase in the future as a result of government borrowing today , they will reduce their consumption and investment accordingly .
on this view , if fiscal austerity relieves households of the burden of future tax increases , they will increase their spending .
this may be true when the economy is operating at full employment – when state and market are in competition for every last resource .
but when there is spare capacity in the economy , the resources “ freed up ” by public-sector retrenchment may simply be wasted .
forecasting organizations are finally admitting that they underestimated the fiscal multiplier .
the obr , reviewing its recent mistakes , accepted that “ the average &#91; fiscal &#93; multiplier over the two years would have needed to be 1.3 – more than double our estimate – to fully explain the weak level of gdp in 2011-12 . ”
the imf has conceded that “ multipliers have actually been in the 0.9 and 1.7 range since the great recession . ”
the effect of underestimating the fiscal multiplier has been systematic misjudgment of the damage that “ fiscal consolidation ” does to the economy .
this leads us to the second mistake .
forecasters assumed that monetary expansion would provide an effective antidote to fiscal contraction .
the bank of england hoped that by printing £ 375 billion of new money , ( $ 600 billion ) , it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £ 50 billion , or 3 % of gdp .
but the evidence emerging from successive rounds of qe in the uk and the us suggests that while it did lower bond yields , the extra money was largely retained within the banking system , and never reached the real economy .
this implies that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit – reluctance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market .
these two mistakes compounded each other : if the negative impact of austerity on economic growth is greater than was originally assumed , and the positive impact of quantitative easing is weaker , then the policy mix favored by practically all european governments has been hugely wrong .
there is much greater scope for fiscal stimulus to boost growth , and much smaller scope for monetary stimulus .
this is all quite technical , but it matters a great deal for the welfare of populations .
all of these models assume outcomes on the basis of existing policies .
their consistent over-optimism about these policies ’ impact on economic growth validates pursuing them , and enables governments to claim that their remedies are “ working , ” when they clearly are not .
this is a cruel deception .
before they can do any good , the forecasters must go back to the drawing board , and ask themselves whether the theories of the economy underpinning their models are the right ones .

hollande in mali
paris – while hundreds of thousands demonstrated in paris against the right of homosexual couples to marry and adopt children , french troops were arriving in mali to stop a coalition of islamist and rebel forces from taking control of its capital , bamako , and creating in the sahel a sanctuary for terrorists .
these are trying times for french president françois hollande .
besieged economically at home , where his popularity is at its lowest since his election last year , can he regain credibility , if not support , as supreme commander of french forces ?
once upon a time , “ i intervene , therefore i am ” might as well have been a french motto , particularly in africa .
but , while french national identity is intimately bound up with france ’ s international standing – how it is perceived in the world – enthusiasm for intervention has receded .
the benefits have become more dubious , while the costs and risks have grown increasingly evident .
if france has again become a regional gendarme by default , it is largely for three reasons .
american enthusiasm for intervention in africa has greatly diminished since the operation in somalia in 1992-1993 – and more globally following the long wars in iraq and afghanistan .
european interest in military intervention in africa is as low as ever .
and , as for the region ’ s governments , it would be an understatement to say that they are not yet ready militarily to take their fate into their own hands .
while france is not alone – manifestations of support have come from its western and african partners , as well as from the middle east – it will bear the primary responsibility and the risks .
for islamic fundamentalists , france is now the “ great satan . ”
indeed , the conflict in mali is taking place geographically in africa , but in many ways its causes and ramifications lie in the middle east .
when france intervened in an african country in the past , there was no risk of terrorist attacks on its territory or on its citizens elsewhere in the world .
that is no longer the case .
it is too early to say what will happen in mali or the sahel – or , for that matter , in france itself .
for the moment , the french are standing , overwhelmingly , behind hollande . they would have criticized him had he remained passive while bamako fell into the hands of terrorists .
yet this support may be fragile , and could collapse if something goes wrong on the ground – or , worse , in france .
before the intervention , mali was not a french priority .
rising unemployment at home seemed to be a more urgent task than did addressing instability in africa .
while the french public agrees that mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists , the way afghanistan did in the late 1990 ’ s , attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades .
in the early 1980 ’ s , after a particularly bloody terrorist attack on french and american forces in lebanon , france ’ s tolerance for military casualties seemed much higher than that of the united states .
but this has changed .
the french now find themselves on the front line at a time when they have much less appetite for it .
moreover , budget restrictions have severely constrained french military capabilities .
french and british military intervention was successful in libya in 2011 at least in part as a result of us military procurement .
of course , from a french perspective , the us role is somewhat ironic .
in the years after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the americans always had to be on the front line – battling the enemy abroad to avoid having to battle him at home , in the parlance of the time – while the european allies were perceived as the cleaning staff .
but imperial fatigue after iraq and afghanistan has left its imprint .
americans are starting to enjoy – probably too much for their allies – what president barack obama , describing the us role in libya , called “ leading from behind . ”
for hollande , war in mali is both an opportunity and a risk .
if nicolas sarkozy , whom he defeated , was widely regarded as “ too ” presidential , hollande has given the impression of not being presidential “ enough . ”
his fall from public grace – too statist and fiscally intrusive for the right , but too moderate and social democratic for the true left – was more rapid than that of any president of the fifth republic .
of course , with unemployment rising every month , it is difficult to remain popular for long .
as the supreme commander of an army at war , hollande can now try to reinvent himself .
but , successive presidents since jacques chirac have failed to reconcile the french with politics .
france ’ s citizens have tended to expect too much from their state , and now they may be expecting too little from politics and politicians at a time when deep divisions on fundamental economic and social issues run not only between the traditional right and left , but also within both camps .
will foreign intervention reunite the french ?
will war in africa be the defining moment of hollande ’ s presidency ?
will he be remembered as the french harry truman – a discreet , uncharismatic man who , when faced with urgent and dramatic circumstances , ended up doing the right things for lack of a better alternative ?
this is a portentous moment both for mali and for security in the sahel and europe .
it is no less significant for hollande and france .

paris – in less than two years , france has carried out three decisive foreign military interventions .
in march 2011 , its airstrikes in libya ( alongside those of great britain ) thwarted colonel muammar el-qaddafi ’ s troops as they prepared to retake the city of benghazi .
a month later , french forces in côte d ’ ivoire arrested president laurent gbagbo , who had refused to recognize his rival ’ s election victory , putting the country at risk of civil war .
now france has intervened in mali .
the latest intervention was initially planned as part of a european mission to support african forces , but france abruptly decided to act unilaterally to blunt the advance of islamists who threatened to overrun mopti , the last barrier before reaching the capital , bamako .
beyond that objective , france seeks to protect its many nationals in the region ; maintain stability in the sahel , where states are very weak ; and prevent mali ’ s transformation into a base of islamist terrorism directed at europe .
a lot is at stake – all the more so because french intervention is likely to be extensive .
while the islamists have been temporarily defeated , they are well armed and receive supplies from libya via algeria , which has suppressed islamists at home but seems to turn a blind eye to their transit through its territory .
moreover , the capabilities of the malian army and those of other west african countries that are supposed to join the operation are too weak to turn the tide .
the united states tried to train the malian army , but failed miserably .
so , with the security of europe as a whole at stake , why is france the only country involved ?
one explanation is to view the intervention as a neo-colonial bid to protect a french preserve .
this is a profound error .
france has no interest in protecting a malian regime that it knows to be corrupt and incompetent ; indeed , france recently refused to support a request from president françois bozizé ’ s regime in the neighboring central african republic for aid in dealing with rebels .
france ’ s motivations are broader .
in particular , france has always considered sub-saharan africa and the arab world to be natural spheres of political and strategic influence that are necessary to maintaining its position as a global power .
the second explanation is more credible : france , aside from great britain , is europe ’ s only true military power .
it believes that operational military capability is a condition of power – a view that is not shared by the overwhelming majority of european states , which continue to display a collective aversion to war .
to be sure , europe has the means for joint action .
in 2003 , following the start of the iraq war , europe embraced a strategy prepared by javier solana , then the european union ’ s high representative for the common foreign and security policy .
but , while a large number of europeans naively believed that this was the prelude to a joint european strategy , the proposal was drafted in terms that were so vague as to allow any outcome – or none .
the eu ’ s lisbon treaty mentions “ permanent structured cooperation ” in security and defense policy , and an entire institutional apparatus of political and military committees exists to anticipate , prepare for , and implement military operations at the european level .
but this mechanism lacks the common political will needed to activate it ; the less it is used , the less usable it will become .
during the libyan crisis , solana ’ s successor , catherine ashton , deliberately sought to limit the eu ’ s role to that of a super-ngo focused on humanitarian aid and economic development .
recently , during the vote on palestinian representation at the united nations , the eu called for its members to abstain – an odd way to affirm europe ’ s commitment to global leadership .
for great britain , europe-wide defense is a nonstarter .
britain has deviated from this principle only once , when it agreed to participate in the atalanta anti-piracy operation off the horn of africa – probably because it was placed in command .
as a result , those who want a common european defense capability lack the means to create it , while those who have the means to create it do not want it ( with the possible exception of france ) .
britain ’ s bilateral cooperation with france – highlighted during the libyan crisis – is sometimes very strong .
but , despite the two countries ’ 2010 treaty on defense and security cooperation , the british have decided , for budgetary reasons , to acquire aircraft that will not be compatible with french aircraft carriers .
even spain and italy , the two countries most affected by developments in the mediterranean and the sahel , have reduced their military expenditures significantly .
unlike germany , both participated in the libyan intervention , but with highly limiting rules of engagement for their forces .
for example , italian naval forces were instructed to avoid the waters off the coast of tripoli , and spanish tanker aircraft were forbidden to refuel fighter jets .
europe as a whole currently devotes only 1.6 % of its gdp to defense , compared to 4.8 % for the us .
it is the only world region where military expenditures are decreasing .
its deployed forces are extremely small , accounting for 4 % of all military personnel worldwide , versus 14 % for the us .
industrial cooperation , which could constitute an economic and military asset , is also weakening , as demonstrated by germany ’ s successful opposition to the proposed eads / bae merger , which was officially canceled in october .
germany had seemed to embark on a more robust policy since its participation in military operations in afghanistan .
now , however , it recoils at any prospect of military intervention , even as it remains the world ’ s third-largest arms exporter .
europe is reluctant to develop a substantial military force , because the european project was created in opposition to the idea of power .
yet this stance has become untenable .
europe faces real threats , which france alone cannot contain .
moreover , the international system is increasingly coalescing around national powers that consider military force to be an essential prerequisite of influence . europe does not face a choice between soft and hard power .
it must combine both if it is to survive .

the french disconnection
paris – dire conditions can permit what was once unthinkable to push its way into public debate .
in france , the idea that now dares to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever-deeper economic malaise unless it regains its monetary sovereignty .
two striking statements on economic policy by france ’ s leaders in the first weeks of this year have highlighted the force of this logic .
first , president françois hollande , worried about the euro ’ s appreciation against other major world currencies , called for an exchange-rate target .
then , pierre moscovici , the finance minister , said that europe might grant france a delay in meeting the 3 % -of-gdp budget-deficit target mandated from this year onward under the eurozone ’ s newly ratified fiscal compact .
these positions imply a desire to exercise sovereign power over the economic and monetary union ’ s rules and decisions .
back in 1989-1991 , exactly the same motive underlay president françois mitterrand ’ s imposition of the euro on germany – that is , to harness the bundesbank ’ s monetary power to a framework in which france could be confident of wielding decisive influence . since the single currency was france ’ s condition for accepting german reunification , germany played along .
two decades later , germany may be in a different mood .
the sovereign-debt-@@ and-@@ banking crisis that has roiled the monetary union since 2010 has steadily exposed the realities at play here , as irrevocably fixed exchange rates lock in and deepen differences in eurozone members ’ competitiveness .
in france ’ s case , the loss of competitiveness and resulting sharp decline in export performance has been aggravated by relying on crushing taxation of labor to finance generous welfare programs and top-@@ drawer public services ( a practice exacerbated by stifling labor-market regulation ) .
in a monetary union , there are only two ways to close a competitiveness gap between countries : transfers from the more competitive to the less competitive , or internal devaluation , which means real wage cuts .
not surprisingly , the preference has been for transfers , which , until the 2008 financial crash , took the form of cross-border private-sector lending to governments and banks .
following the credit-@@ bubble burst in 2008 , fiscal transfers replaced these private financial flows , causing budget deficits to balloon .
and now , with the german government , as chief creditor , calling the shots on cross-border transfers to weaker eurozone countries , all such transfers are conditional on austerity ( that is , internal devaluation ) .
bailouts from the european stability mechanism represent the clearest example of this , with the fiscal compact now committing signatories to tight deficit targets and structural adjustment .
and more austerity is a vital , if less well remarked on , condition of the european central bank ’ s declared willingness to buy unlimited quantities of troubled countries ’ short-term government debt .
so far , the “ bazooka ” represented by the ecb ’ s “ outright monetary transactions ” program has had the desired effect – without having to be used .
eurozone financial markets have stabilized , and the euro has appreciated against the dollar and the yen .
but , as hollande ’ s recent declarations indicate , currency appreciation is the last thing that an uncompetitive country like france needs .
although the french government , unlike its spanish and italian counterparts , has not yet had any difficulty financing itself at low interest rates , currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an un@@ lit bonfire .
unless growth is restored , france ’ s already large public debt will expand unsustainably , heightening the risk that investors will shun french government bonds .
from this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity , because this would boost economic growth , in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run . it is no surprise that moscovici is beginning to push for a “ collective european decision ” to relax the fiscal treaty ’ s terms , given that french compliance would require massive new spending cuts .
will germany agree to such a relaxation – or , for that matter , to hollande ’ s implicit demand that the ecb follow japan ’ s example and loosen monetary policy to drive the exchange rate back down ?
unlike japan ( and , of course , the united states ) , france , as a member of a monetary union , cannot pursue domestic goals unilaterally .
to avoid disaster , france has only two options : somehow force a change in german policy or go it alone .
there are two reasons why , until now , the second option – leaving the monetary union – has been unthinkable .
the first has to do with economic and financial risks . ditching the euro might trigger a banking crisis , capital flight , inflation , and perhaps even sovereign default .
on the other hand , higher competitiveness and erosion of the real value of debt would quickly outweigh these costs by restoring confidence in the french economy ’ s prospects .
this strategy ’ s success , starting with the speed of restored access to external financing , would depend on the credibility of government policies – monetary , fiscal , and , above all , the radical and indispensable supply-side reforms for which there would now be breathing space .
the specter of continuing economic stagnation and ever-rising unemployment ( with the young and older workers being the worst hit ) should remove the second , geopolitical obstacle to a french exit from the eurozone .
for french elites since world war ii , alignment with germany has been central to projecting french power and influence .
such ambitions must now be sacrificed for the sake of the french public ’ s well-being .
france will not regain its economic strength without setting aside the euro .
even during that adjustment , there is no reason why relations with european partners should suffer in any fundamental sense .
on the contrary , the sustainable prosperity that would result from that adjustment would create a much healthier long-term foundation for continuing the quest for an “ ever closer union ” in europe .

why france will sink europe ’ s constitution
if public opinion polls are to be believed , on may 29 the french will reject the european union ’ s draft constitutional treaty . because all eu member countries must ratify the constitution , a french “ non ” will , in effect , kill it .
amazing as this turn of events seems , it has been long in the making .
it is amazing because france is not just a founding member of the european community , but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward “ ever closer union . ”
but french opposition was also predictable because , for over a decade now , france has veered away from europe and now finds itself increasingly isolated .
of course , europe has also moved away from france through successive enlargements , but the main roots of the estrangement lie in france itself .
the french regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige – not only in world politics , but also in culture , science and , importantly , language .
europe , in their view , was always a way of reclaiming world influence .
for three decades , this worked .
france and germany had forged an alliance that called the shots in europe .
not interested in geopolitical power – a legacy of its nazi past – germany was content to back france ’ s ambitions as long as the common market allowed it to be europe ’ s economic powerhouse .
but that alliance is unraveling as germany ’ s own status declines , owing to its mediocre economic performance and the loss of its prestigious deutschemark .
moreover , germany is increasingly interested in exercising political influence on its own ; as a result , it is no longer happy with what it gets from the alliance with france .
at the same time , successive eu enlargements over the decades have brought in other powerful contenders , chiefly spain and the uk , as well as smaller countries who are unwilling to bow before french-german leadership .
in short , france has lost control of europe .
this is not new , but it has only recently started to sink in , and it hurts .
france is also economically wounded .
here is a country that has long cherished its “ exception ” from the normal rules of market economics , a foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets and claims to offer a well-balanced middle ground .
the french do not care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a “ third way , ” for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets in order to defend “ higher ” values from the single-minded pursuit of materialism .
this view , propagated since world war ii by a quasi-marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the french do not even bother to understand how markets operate .
they look upon economics as an ideological battleground , where all views can be entertained without being confronted with logic , much less with facts .
yet facts have been hitting hard .
growth has been lackluster for a quarter of a century and unemployment remains stubbornly high .
urban crime , once described as the wages of unfettered individualism , now resembles what is found in the united states , the french model ’ s bête noire .
what has this to do with europe ?
the eu , by design , increases economic competition , but france is ill equipped .
one after the other , most european countries have reformed their economies , shedding the cozy arrangements that used to protect every interest group from the pressure of competition .
even germany , after even worse performance than france , has now taken decisive steps .
unable to reform their labor markets because of the fear of street protests , french governments of all political stripes seek to protect their ailing firms , only to face limits imposed by the rules of the common market .
the bloated french public sector , which many see as the employer of last resort , cannot afford its expensive personnel .
while many private french firms are thriving , they do so by economizing on manpower and , increasingly , by outsourcing production , often to new eu member countries where labor costs are considerably lower .
public education is in shambles and france ’ s higher education system now faces competition from other european countries .
humbled by economic malaise and loss of influence , the french are scared .
they fear the future , because the future means either market-oriented reforms or further economic and political downgrading , both of which are seen as unacceptable , if only because they clash with french self-esteem .
the european constitution has little to do with any of these challenges , but a majority of french people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked france ’ s diminishing status .
they are alarmed by what they see as the domination of anglo-saxon economic principles – the last nail in the coffin of france ’ s mythical “ exception . ”
so the eu is now seen as the trojan horse that threatens the myriad of state-sanctioned benefits and handouts that every citizen enjoys .
of course , most french people would ultimately benefit from doing away with this inefficient web of big and small privileges , but most voters , depressed by poor economic prospects and unnerved by high unemployment , are simply unwilling to take the risk .
they do not understand the roots of their economic troubles and are nostalgic for better times .
they mistakenly see the european constitution as one more challenge , at a time when they want to be nursed and protected .
scared people rarely make wise choices .

why free trade matters
new york – contrary to what skeptics often assert , the case for free trade is robust .
it extends not just to overall prosperity ( or “ aggregate gnp ” ) , but also to distributional outcomes , which makes the free-trade argument morally compelling as well .
the link between trade openness and economic prosperity is strong and suggestive .
for example , arvind panagariya of columbia university divided developing countries into two groups : “ miracle ” countries that had annual per capita gdp growth rates of 3 % or higher , and “ debacle ” countries that had negative or zero growth rates .
panagariya found commensurate corresponding growth rates of trade for both groups in the period 1961-1999 .
of course , it could be argued that gdp growth causes trade growth , rather than vice versa – that is , until one examines the countries in depth .
nor can one argue that trade growth has little to do with trade policy : while lower transport costs have increased trade volumes , so has steady reduction of trade barriers .
more compelling is the dramatic upturn in gdp growth rates in india and china after they turned strongly towards dismantling trade barriers in the late 1980 ’ s and early 1990 ’ s .
in both countries , the decision to reverse protectionist policies was not the only reform undertaken , but it was an important component .
in the developed countries , too , trade liberalization , which started earlier in the postwar period , was accompanied by other forms of economic opening ( for example , a return to currency convertibility ) , resulting in rapid gdp growth .
economic expansion was interrupted in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , but the cause was the macroeconomic crises triggered by the success of the opec cartel and the ensuing deflationary policies pursued by then-federal reserve chairman paul volcker .
moreover , the negative argument that historical experience supports the case for protectionism is flawed .
the economic historian douglas irwin has challenged the argument that nineteenth-century protectionist policy aided the growth of infant industries in the united states .
he has also shown that many of the nineteenth century ’ s successful high-@@ tariff countries , such as canada and argentina , used tariffs as a revenue source , not as a means of sheltering domestic manufacturers .
nor should free traders worry that trade openness resulted in no additional growth for some developing countries , as critics contend .
trade is only a facilitating device .
for instance , if your infrastructure is bad , or you have domestic policies that prevent investors from responding to market opportunities ( such as south asia ’ s stifling licensing restrictions ) , you will see no results .
to gain from trade openness , you have to ensure that complementary policies are in place .
but then critics shift ground and argue that trade-driven growth benefits only the elites and not the poor ; it is not “ inclusive . ”
in india , however , the shift to accelerated growth after reforms that included trade liberalization has pulled nearly 200 million people out of poverty .
in china , which grew faster , it is estimated that more than 300 million people have moved above the poverty line since the start of reforms .
in fact , developed countries benefit from trade ’ s effect on poverty reduction as well .
contrary to much popular opinion , trade with poor countries does not pauperi@@ ze rich countries .
the opposite is true .
it is unskilled , labor-saving technical change that is putting pressure on the wages of workers , whereas imports of cheaper , labor-intensive goods from developing countries help the poor who consume these goods .
if freer trade reduces poverty , it is presump@@ tuous for the critics to claim greater virtue .
in truth , the free traders control the moral high ground : with at least a billion people still living in poverty , what greater moral imperative do we have than to reduce that number ?
talk about “ social justice ” is intoxicating , but actually doing something about it is difficult .
here the free traders have a distinct edge .
as the historian frank trentmann has demonstrated , the case for free trade was made in nineteenth-century britain in moral terms : it was held to promote not just economic prosperity , but also peace .
it is also worth recalling that us secretary of state cordell hull was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1945 for policies that included his tireless efforts on behalf of multilateral free trade .
it is time for the norwegian nobel committee to step up again .

rule , ger@@ mania
princeton – a persistent theme – indeed the leitmotif – of the way that german leaders discuss the eurozone is their insistence on the importance of following the rules .
that refrain is followed by a chorus from the rest of the monetary union demanding to know why germany is taking such an inflexible approach .
the answer , it turns out , reflects the way germany ’ s federal system of government has shaped its decision-making , as well as germany ’ s historic experience with debt crises .
germany ’ s obsession with rules long predates the current eurozone crisis .
the country ’ s policymakers always insisted that europe could not have a common currency without first achieving economic convergence .
but that looked like it would never happen .
so , in the 1990s , as the eurozone was being established , germany argued for rigorous enforcement of the “ convergence criteria , ” the requirements necessary for adopting the euro .
economists in every other country ridiculed the teutonic fixation on firm rules .
there is no reason , for example , why a debt-to-gdp ratio of 59 % should be considered safe , but 62 % regarded as irresponsibly dangerous .
but the germans insisted – and ultimately got what they wanted .
that approach stemmed in part from germany ’ s political structure .
the more federal a country ’ s system of government is , the more rules are needed to ensure its smooth functioning .
when the responsibilities of different levels of government are not clearly de@@ limited , there is the danger that officials will try to pass burdens to higher levels .
in order to avoid this , federations often adopt a legalistic approach .
indeed , there is a strong correlation , historically , between successful federations and a stable monetary policy undergirded by clear rules .
in the late twentieth century , switzerland , germany , and the united states – all federal countries – were pioneers in applying a stability-oriented monetary policy .
given that the eurozone is in many ways federal in its structure , a clear commitment to the rules seemed to germany to be a prerequisite for its success .
to be sure , even germans know that rules sometimes need to be bent .
thinkers as far back as aristotle have argued that rules fail when they are too rigid .
in the nicomachean ethics , aristotle pointed to the use by sculp@@ tors on the island of lesbos of rulers made from flexible lead – rather than rigid iron – for cutting curved lines in stone .
the ability to reshape the rulers to fit the stone served as a metaphor for the need to adjust laws when circumstance change .
but when it comes to debt , germans have insisted on using the most rigid of rulers .
since the beginning of the eurozone crisis , the german government dug in its heels on european treaty provisions that it interprets as forbidding bailouts and monetary financing of government debt .
recently , germany reacted to a proposal to forgive a portion of greece ’ s debt by maintaining that the treaty provision that proscribes bailouts also rules out state bankruptcies and debt forgiveness .
the lesson that germany has taken from its history is that debt is an area in which flexibility must be steadfastly avoided .
this might come as a surprise to american commentators , who have argued that germany is acting hypocritically , having defaulted on its debts in 1923 , 1932-1933 , 1945 , and 1953 , only to insist today that others do differently .
the truth is that germans viewed nearly all of those defaults as destabilizing .
the internal default in 1923 , conducted via hyperinflation , weakened the german financial system and helped cause the great depression .
the defaults in the early 1930s became inevitable when germany could not access private capital markets and the country had lost faith in its future .
rather than set the stage for a sustainable economic recovery , deflation and default fanned the flames of nationalism – to disastrous effect .
the default of 1945 was the consequence of losing world war ii .
indeed , the tradition of so-called ordo@@ liberalism that has shaped germany ’ s post-war economic policy was a response to the nazis ’ destructive arbitrariness .
only the debt cancellation of 1953 is viewed in a positive light in germany , and a look at the circumstances in which it occurred reveals much about the country ’ s approach to the eurozone crisis .
as the yale economist timothy guinnane has shown , the debt that was canceled was not the principal , but accumulated interest arrears that had not been paid between the great depression and wwii .
more important , from germany ’ s perspective , was the political context in which the negotiations took place .
for starters , there had been a complete regime change in germany .
the victorious allies had removed those responsible for the destructive , destabilizing policies of the past , providing the country with a clean break and its debtors with confidence that germany was on a new course .
furthermore , germany ’ s new policymakers had demonstrated their financial seriousness .
in 1950 , the country had undergone a severe balance-of-payments crisis .
some officials were in favor of capital controls , but the government instead implemented monetary austerity .
this experience explains another of germany ’ s obsessions : reforms in debtor countries .
germany needed a complete change of its domestic regime to break out of its cycle of debt and default .
that might be a bit much to ask in the context of the eurozone ; but , without a fundamental reorientation of a country ’ s politics , the thinking in germany goes , debt forgiveness will always remain a futile exercise .

why germany should lead or leave
new york – europe has been in a financial crisis since 2007 .
when the bankruptcy of lehman brothers endangered the credit of financial institutions , private credit was replaced by the credit of the state , revealing an unrecognized flaw in the euro .
by transferring their right to print money to the european central bank ( ecb ) , member countries exposed themselves to the risk of default , like third world countries heavily indebted in a foreign currency .
commercial banks loaded with weaker countries ’ government bonds became potentially insolvent .
there is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982 .
back then , the international monetary fund saved the global banking system by lending just enough money to heavily indebted countries ; default was avoided , but at the cost of a lasting depression .
latin america suffered a lost decade .
germany is playing the same role today as the imf did then .
the setting differs , but the effect is the same .
creditors are shifting the entire burden of adjustment on to the debtor countries and avoiding their own responsibility .
the euro crisis is a complex mixture of banking and sovereign-debt problems , as well as divergences in economic performance that have given rise to balance-of-payments imbalances within the eurozone .
the authorities did not understand the complexity of the crisis , let alone see a solution . so they tried to buy time .
usually , that works .
financial panics subside , and the authorities realize a profit on their intervention .
but not this time , because the financial problems were combined with a process of political disintegration .
when the european union was created , it was the embodiment of an open society – a voluntary association of equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good .
the euro crisis is now turning the eu into something fundamentally different , dividing member countries into two classes – creditors and debtors – with the creditors in charge .
as the strongest creditor country , germany has emerged as the hegemon .
debtor countries pay substantial risk premiums for financing their government debt .
this is reflected in their cost of financing in general .
to make matters worse , the bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in germany ’ s traumatic experience with inflation .
as a result , it recognizes only inflation as a threat to stability , and ignores deflation , which is the real threat today .
moreover , germany ’ s insistence on austerity for debtor countries can easily become counterproductive by increasing the debt ratio as gdp falls .
there is a real danger that a two-tier europe will become permanent . both human and financial resources will be attracted to the center , leaving the periphery permanently depressed .
but the periphery is seething with discontent .
europe ’ s tragedy is not the result of an evil plot , but stems , rather , from a lack of coherent policies .
as in ancient greek tragedies , misconceptions and a sheer lack of understanding have had unintended but fateful consequences .
germany , as the largest creditor country , is in charge , but refuses to take on additional liabilities ; as a result , every opportunity to resolve the crisis has been missed .
the crisis spread from greece to other deficit countries , eventually calling into question the euro ’ s very survival .
since a breakup of the euro would cause immense damage , germany always does the minimum necessary to hold it together .
most recently , german chancellor angela merkel has backed ecb president mario draghi , leaving bundesbank president jens weidmann isolated .
this will enable the ecb to put a lid on the borrowing costs of countries that submit to an austerity program under the supervision of the troika ( the imf , the ecb , and the european commission ) .
that will save the euro , but it is also a step toward the permanent division of europe into debtors and creditors .
the debtors are bound to reject a two-tier europe sooner or later .
if the euro breaks up in disarray , the common market and the eu will be destroyed , leaving europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began , owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility .
the later the breakup , the worse the ultimate outcome .
so it is time to consider alternatives that until recently would have been inconceivable .
in my judgment , the best course of action is to persuade germany to choose between either leading the creation of a political union with genuine burden-sharing , or leaving the euro .
since all of the accumulated debt is denominated in euros , it makes all the difference who remains in charge of the monetary union@@ .@@ if germany left , the euro would depreciate .
debtor countries would regain their competitiveness ; their debt would diminish in real terms ; and , with the ecb under their control , the threat of default would disappear and their borrowing costs would fall to levels comparable to that in the united kingdom .
the creditor countries , by contrast , would incur losses on their claims and investments denominated in euros and encounter stiffer competition at home from other eurozone members .
the extent of creditor countries ’ losses would depend on the extent of the depreciation , giving them an interest in keeping the depreciation within bounds .
after initial dislocations , the eventual outcome would fulfill john maynard keynes ’ dream of an international currency system in which both creditors and debtors share responsibility for maintaining stability .
and europe would avert the looming depression .
the same result could be achieved , with less cost to germany , if germany chose to behave as a benevolent hegemon .
that would mean implementing the proposed european banking union ; establishing a more or less level playing field between debtor and creditor countries by establishing a debt reduction fund , and eventually converting all debt into eurobonds ; and aiming at nominal gdp growth of up to 5 % , so that europe could grow its way out of excessive indebtedness .

why greece declined a euro holiday
brussels – for the entire first half of this year , since the far-left , anti-austerity syriza party came to power in january , the greek saga virtually monopolized the attention of european policymakers .
even as their country ’ s economy crashed , greece ’ s new government remained adamant in demanding debt relief without austerity – that is , until mid-july , when they suddenly agreed to the creditors ’ terms .
indeed , as of july 13 , greece ’ s staunchly anti-austerity government has been obliged to impose even tougher austerity and pursue painful structural reforms , under its creditors ’ close supervision .
why did the greek government concede to terms that not only controver@@ ted its own promises , but also closely resembled those that voters had overwhelmingly rejected in a popular referendum barely a week earlier ?
many believe that greek prime minister alexis tsipras was responding to an ultimatum from his european partners : accept our demands or leave the euro .
the question is why a greek exit from the euro ( “ grexit ” ) amounted to such a potent threat .
in fact , from an economic perspective , grexit no longer represents the potential catastrophe that it once did .
after all , the main short-term cost – financial-system disruption – has already materialized in greece : banks and the stock market have been shut down , and capital controls have been imposed .
while those actions were needed to stem large-scale capital flight and prevent the banking system ’ s collapse , they also caused the greek economy to contract sharply .
in this context , greek negotiators might have considered another proposal , circulated informally by the german finance ministry , recommending that greece receive immediate debt forgiveness , in exchange for leaving the euro temporarily .
if greece remained in the euro , no relief would be granted – a proviso consistent with the german position that debt restructuring for eurozone countries would be illegal .
while the legal argument is probably spurious , an outright debt reduction for a eurozone country remains politically impossible .
the german proposal , spearheaded by finance minister wolfgang schäuble , highlights the fundamental change that has occurred in greece ’ s relationship with its european partners since its last bailout package three years ago . in 2012 , greece was offered hundreds of billions of euros in financial support , and its creditors , including greek commercial banks , were pushed to accept substantial “ voluntary ” haircuts .
tellingly , when george papandreou , greece ’ s prime minister at the time , proposed a referendum on the existing adjustment program and his country ’ s continued eurozone membership in 2011 , he was warned off in no uncertain terms by france ’ s then-president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel .
though papandreou would have campaigned for the adjustment program and the euro , a referendum was a risk that his european partners were unwilling to take .
tsipras ’ s government , by contrast , was able to hold its referendum , and even campaign against the creditors ’ proposed adjustment program ( which , it should be noted , was no longer on the table ) .
even the resounding “ no ” delivered by greek voters could not strengthen the government ’ s negotiating position , for a simple reason : grexit is no longer considered a threat to the euro ’ s stability .
that is why german officials – especially schäuble – have been encouraging greece to leave .
one can only speculate about schäuble ’ s motivation in pushing for grexit .
he seems to believe that a more integrated eurozone , though certainly desirable , is not feasible with a country that cannot be trusted to abide by the terms to which its government has agreed .
whatever schäuble ’ s reasons , his proposal could have represented a way out for greece , whose economy had been squeezed dry by austerity and whose banking system was already closed .
immediate debt reduction and the recovery of economic sovereignty – even at the expense of exiting the euro , at least temporarily – would seem to have offered significant long-term benefits .
in a sense , it amounted to a golden opportunity , with germany offering to pay for something that many believe greece should be doing anyway .
nonetheless , the greek government rejected an exit , and instead accepted the creditors ’ tough terms .
this suggests that , during the negotiations , greece ’ s leaders were driven by more than economics .
perhaps , contrary to popular belief , countries ’ political attachment to europe via the euro remains very strong , even where , as in greece , people have endured unprecedented hardship since joining the monetary union .
the monetary union ’ s rationale , as many have noted , was always more political than economic .
for precisely that reason , it may well be too early to write off the single currency .

why greece will default
cambridge – greece will default on its national debt .
that default will be due in large part to its membership in the european monetary union .
if it were not part of the euro system , greece might not have gotten into its current predicament and , even if it had gotten into its current predicament , it could have avoided the need to default .
greece ’ s default on its national debt need not mean an explicit refusal to make principal and interest payments when they come due .
more likely would be an imf-@@ organized restructuring of the existing debt , swapping new bonds with lower principal and interest for existing bonds .
or it could be a “ soft default ” in which greece unilaterally services its existing debt with new debt rather than paying in cash .
but , whatever form the default takes , the current owners of greek debt will get less than the full amount that they are now owed .
the only way that greece could avoid a default would be by cutting its future annual budget deficits to a level that foreign and domestic investors would be willing to finance on a voluntary basis .
at a minimum , that would mean reducing the deficit to a level that stops the rise in the debt-to-gdp ratio .
to achieve that , the current deficit of 14 % of gdp would have to fall to 5 % of gdp or less .
but to bring the debt-to-gdp ratio to the 60 % level prescribed by the maastricht treaty would require reducing the annual budget deficit to just 3 % of gdp – the goal that the eurozone ’ s finance ministers have said that greece must achieve by 2012 .
reducing the budget deficit by 10 % of gdp would mean an enormous cut in government spending or a dramatic rise in tax revenue – or , more likely , both .
quite apart from the political difficulty of achieving this would be the very serious adverse effect on aggregate domestic demand , and therefore on production and employment .
greece ’ s unemployment rate already is 10 % , and its gdp is already expected to fall at an annual rate of more than 4 % , pushing joblessness even higher .
depressing economic activity further through higher taxes and reduced government spending would cause offsetting reductions in tax revenue and offsetting increases in transfer payments to the unemployed .
so every planned euro of deficit reduction delivers less than a euro of actual deficit reduction .
that means that planned tax increases and cuts in basic government spending would have to be even larger than 10 % of gdp in order to achieve a 3 % -of-gdp budget deficit .
there simply is no way around the arithmetic implied by the scale of deficit reduction and the accompanying economic decline : greece ’ s default on its debt is inevitable .
greece might have been able to avoid that outcome if it were not in the eurozone .
if greece still had its own currency , the authorities could devalue it while tightening fiscal policy .
a devalued currency would increase exports and would cause greek households and firms to substitute domestic products for imported goods .
the increased demand for greek goods and services would raise greece ’ s gdp , increasing tax revenue and reducing transfer payments .
in short , fiscal consolidation would be both easier and less painful if greece had its own monetary policy .
greece ’ s membership in the eurozone was also a principal cause of its current large budget deficit .
because greece has not had its own currency for more than a decade , there has been no market signal to warn greece that its debt was growing unacceptably large .
if greece had remained outside the eurozone and retained the drachma , the large increased supply of greek bonds would cause the drachma to decline and the interest rate on the bonds to rise .
but , because greek euro bonds were regarded as a close substitute for other countries ’ euro bonds , the interest rate on greek bonds did not rise as greece increased its borrowing – until the market began to fear a possible default .
the substantial surge in the interest rate on greek bonds relative to german bonds in the past few weeks shows that the market now regards such a default as increasingly likely .
the combination of credits from the other eurozone countries and lending by the imf may provide enough liquidity to stave off default for a while .
in exchange for this liquidity support , greece will be forced to accept painful fiscal tightening and falling gdp .
in the end , greece , the eurozone ’ s other members , and greece ’ s creditors will have to accept that the country is insolvent and cannot service its existing debt .
at that point , greece will default .

why has america ’ s economic recovery stalled ?
cambridge – the united states ’ import bill now exceeds $ 2.4 trillion a year , more than twice that of china and greater than that of the 27 european union countries combined .
since the volume of us imports varies with the overall strength of the american economy , so does the volume of other countries ’ exports .
so it was good news for everyone when the us economy began expanding in the summer of 2009 , 19 months after falling into the recession that officially started in december 2007 .
unfortunately , the recovery has turned out to be very anemic .
now , 15 months into the expansion , the level of real gdp is still lower than it was when the recession started .
even more worrying , the rate of gdp growth has been declining almost from the start of the recovery .
real gdp rose by 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , reflecting the end of the decline in inventories .
gdp growth then fell to 3.7 % in the first quarter of 2010 and to only 1.7 % in the second quarter .
the third quarter is shaping up to be much like the second .
this recovery has been much weaker than previous ones because of fundamental differences in the cause of the downturn and in the policies chosen to achieve recovery .
previous downturns were caused by the central bank ’ s efforts to reverse or prevent inflation by hiking short-term interest rates .
when the central bank succeeded , it lowered those rates and the economy bounced back .
but this time the downturn was not caused by higher interest rates , and reducing those rates did not produce a strong rebound .
this recession was caused by a mispricing of risk , leading to excessive leverage and high prices for a wide range of assets .
when those price bubbles burst , households lost substantial wealth and financial markets became dysfunctional .
because the downturn was not caused by high interest rates , lowering them could not lift the economy out of recession .
the obama administration therefore turned to fiscal policy – tax cuts and a range of spending programs .
unfortunately , the fiscal stimulus was not well enough designed to get the economy onto a strong , self-sustaining growth path .
and , now that those stimulus programs are coming to an end , there is a danger that the economy will slide back into slow growth or even recession .
one key to the us economy ’ s future is household demand .
although consumer spending has increased during the past four quarters , helped by substantial government transfer payments , the pace of spending growth by households was less than the overall pace of gdp growth , because households were increasing their rate of saving .
indeed , household saving rose from 2 % of after-tax incomes in 2007 to about 6 % in recent months .
if the saving rate continues to rise at the same pace in the future as it has over the past three years , the overall gdp growth rate could turn negative after a few quarters .
of course , there is no way to be certain of what will happen to saving .
but it is worth remembering that the saving rate averaged 9 % in the quarter-century from 1960 to 1985 .
if the saving rate now rises quickly to that level , it will be hard to keep overall gdp growing .
a significantly higher saving rate would help the us economy in the long run , but it would be a barrier to robust growth in the next few years .
a major obstacle to higher consumer spending is the current condition of the housing market .
the rapid rise in house prices until 2006 caused households to increase their spending , financed in part by converting home equity into cash .
but house prices have since fallen some 40 % on average , leaving one-third of homeowners with mortgages owing more than their house is worth .
the resulting fall in wealth has reduced consumer spending , while the decline in homeowners ’ equity prevents borrowing to finance any increase .
and the recent end of a special tax subsidy for first-time homebuyers has caused house prices to start falling again .
if that decline continues , it will inevitably reduce the pace of consumer spending .
earlier this year , economic forecasters were predicting that annual gdp growth would reach 3 % or more in the second half of 2010 .
now those projections have been cut to less than 2 % , which is too slow to make a dent in the very high rate of unemployment .
the forecasters have now shifted their predictions of 3 % -plus growth to 2011 .
let ’ s hope that they are right this time .

whereas putin is reveling in the attention that russia is receiving as host of the 2018 world cup , emanuel has informed the us soccer federation and fifa that chicago has no interest in serving as a host city when the event comes to north america in 2026 .
canada and mexico will each host ten matches , and the united states will host another 60 . so why is the third-largest us city taking a pass ?
to understand what it means to host a global sporting event , consider the fact that putin ’ s government spent $ 51-@@ 70 billion to stage the 2014 winter olympics in sochi , and is projected to spend at least $ 14 billion hosting the current world cup , which runs through july 15 .
russia ’ s budget provided for the construction of seven new stadiums – including one in st. petersburg that cost around $ 1.7 billion – and renov@@ ations to five other venues .
and that does not even account for the additional expenses for training facilities , lodging , expanded infrastructure , and security .
chicago , having already hosted the opening ceremony and first match of the 1994 world cup , has adopted quite a different mindset .
emanuel ’ s spokesperson , matt mcgrath , recently issued a statement explaining that , “ fifa could not provide a basic level of certainty on some major unknowns that put our city and taxpayers at risk . ” fifa , mcgrath alleges , was demanding something tantamount to a “ blank check , ” including an “ open-ended ability to modify the agreement … at any time and at their discretion . ”
moreover , fifa would have required that soldier field – home to the chicago bears football team – be taken out of use for two months prior to the tournament .
in the end , emanuel ’ s office concluded that , “ the uncertainty for taxpayers , coupled with fifa ’ s inflexibility and unwillingness to negotiate , were clear indications that further pursuit of the bid wasn ’ t in chicago ’ s best interests . ”
in addition to holding anywhere from two to six games – potentially over the course of a number of weeks – world cup host cities are expected to throw a “ fan fest , ” furnish training facilities for the teams , and provide extensive tax exemptions for a range of activities .
in fact , fifa prohibits both direct and indirect taxation on all income from the event , exempting continental soccer confederations , host-country broadcasters , and fifa member associations , service providers , and contractors .
it is little wonder , then , that minneapolis and vancouver have joined chicago in declining the hosting honor .
to justify its imperi@@ ous behavior , fifa points out that , “ &#91; the &#93; world cup is a major sporting event that attracts global attention to the host country / host countries and provides the opportunity for significant financial investment in sporting and public infrastructure . ” and that added attention and investment , fifa claims , “ may contribute to significant mid- and long-term socioeconomic benefits … as well as economic growth . ”
but note the carefully qualified language .
fifa only goes so far as to promise an “ opportunity for significant financial investment ” in infrastructure , as well as attention and investment that “ may contribute ” to growth .
in reality , scholarly evidence shows that the world cup rarely benefits host countries and cities as much as fifa would like the public , and public officials , to think .
for example , consider what russia gets in exchange for its $ 14 billion-plus investment in this year ’ s event .
while all of the revenue from ticket sales , international broadcasting rights , and sponsorships will go directly to fifa , russia will be left with seven new stadiums and five refurbished facilities that it does not need .
and unless it demolishes these venues , it will have to spend tens of millions of dollars every year to maintain them .
to be sure , images of sleek new facilities are being disseminated worldwide .
but the optics are not necessarily working in russia ’ s favor .
apparently , there was no hiding the 6,000 empty seats at the uruguay-@@ egypt match on june 15 .
if history is any guide , it is highly unlikely that the 2018 world cup will increase russia ’ s international investment or trade , boost its tourism industry , or strengthen its people ’ s commitment to physical fitness .
what it will do is instill a fleeting sense of national pride among a significant portion of russians , while offering an ephemeral distraction from the country ’ s mounting problems .
with or without the world cup , oil-price volatility and international sanctions imposed in response to putin ’ s 2014 annexation of crimea will continue to darken russia ’ s economic prospects and diminish ordinary russians ’ standard of living .
so , whom should you trust ?
i ’ m going with emanuel .

why i am challenging putin
russia is living through the deepest , most prolonged crisis in modern history .
it is a man-made crisis that has struck every sphere of society and the state .
this crisis is not a natural disaster but one engineered by the choice of a false doctrine of reform , one that is leading the country to degradation .
few people believe in the putin regime &apos;s ability to achieve serious change .
the corruption and inefficiency of the state apparatus and the government &apos;s incompetence and inertia leave no hope for a real improvement in living standards .
instead of the state being strengthened , it is being reborn as a police-@@ bureaucratic apparatus to suppress social protest , extort bribes , and assure political repression .
i am running for president in order to cleanse the state apparatus of corruption and bureaucratic arbitrariness and to summon competent and responsible people into state service .
russia cannot withstand another four years of plunder and destruction .
i am running so as to implement a real program to rebuild the economy .
the current regime will not implement such a program and will continue to serve the oligarchic clans that have grown fat by plundering state property .
putin &apos;s corrupt and irresponsible regime has become part of the system of oligarchic parasi@@ tism , with its pathologically unjust distribution of incomes and property .
the current regime is ignoring an immutable law of governance : a state &apos;s effectiveness is indivisible from its responsibility for social justice .
by abandoning this responsibility , today &apos;s state has become not only ineffective but dangerous .
the impoverishment of great masses of the population has destroyed the structures of civil society , giving rise to a &quot; civilization of slums . &quot;
roughly half of russia &apos;s population , primarily children , is not getting enough to eat .
child neglect and homelessness are growing .
towns and villages are swamped by violence and banditry .
poverty , psychological stress , and the collapse of health care have led to an anomalously high death rate , a mass decrease in health , and the wasting of colossal labor resources .
many people cannot buy the most basic medicines and have no access to modern medical services .
the prospects for modernizing or even preserving the national health care system are shrinking with every year .
i am running in the election in order to guarantee everyone living in our country , which is the richest in the world , the constitutional right to a decent life and to develop freely .
in order to do this , we must take back as state revenue the profits from the exploitation of our natural wealth , double the budget , and guarantee everyone &apos;s real right to free education and healthcare .
the &quot; reforms &quot; that have been conducted over the last 15 years have denied a large proportion of the work-@@ fit population , primarily young people , of jobs and the right to a decent life .
but they are the backbone of our country .
continuing on the current path will only destroy the nation &apos;s workers .
implementing our program of social justice and economic growth will allow wages to be doubled in the course of a year by bringing them into line with labor &apos;s contribution to the national income , expanding workers &apos; rights to stand up for their interests , and increasing the minimum wage by three times .
real wages should grow fourfold by 2010 ; pensions must also grow accordingly .
economic growth must encompass all regions of the country , and people must have equal social guarantees , rights , and opportunities regardless of their place of residence .
at the moment , revenues are diverted away from the regions to the center and then dispatched abroad ­ - the oligarchs &apos; wealth of billions comes from fleecing the russian provinces .
i will put an end to this .
to improve the economy we will direct lending to manufacturing and entrepreneurial activity , protect the right to honestly earned and legally acquired property , rebuild savings , and stimulate scientific-technical innovation and investment .
markets will be purged of criminals and monopolies ; honest competition will begin to operate .
those who work well and benefit society will get high incomes , not those who take what belongs to other people .
the prices of basic commodities and charges for electricity , heating , and other vital services will be reduced to their actual production costs .
the geopolitical legacy of the ussr as a great power has been squandered over the years of &quot; reform . &quot;
reform of the armed services has boiled down to disarmament alone .
combat capability has fallen to an unprecedented low level .
russia is being threatened with losing its status as a power .
russia will not be reborn without the rebirth of a powerful , modern army .
afflicted by corruption , the law-enforcement authorities are not in a position to prevent the threat of terrorism or to crush organized crime .
i will purge these bodies of corruption , eradicate organized crime , and liberate our towns from terrorists and bandits .
under the slogan of the market , the current regime has allowed depravity to flourish on television and in mass culture .
the profound values of russian culture are being systematically destroyed , stripping life of its meaning and joy , and sowing an enmity of each against all .
to give russians back a feeling of pride in their homeland , and to create the conditions for a revival of our historical spiritual and cultural traditions , we must revive our schools , eradicate the spirit of depravity and violence in the media , provide everyone with access to masterpieces of russian culture , and create the conditions for a social partnership between the state and the church .
now is the moment for russians to take russia back !

why india is riskier than china
new haven – today , fears are growing that china and india are about to be the next victims of the ongoing global economic carnage .
this would have enormous consequences .
asia ’ s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.5 % average annual rate over 2010-11 – nearly triple the 3 % growth elsewhere in the world .
if china and india are next to fall , asia would be at risk , and it would be hard to avoid a global recession .
in one important sense , these concerns are understandable : both economies depend heavily on the broader global climate .
china is sensitive to downside risks to external demand – more relevant than ever since crisis-torn europe and the united states collectively accounted for 38 % of total exports in 2010 .
but india , with its large current-account deficit and external funding needs , is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets .
yet fears of hard landings for both economies are overblown , especially regarding china .
yes , china is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus undertaken in the depths of the subprime crisis .
the banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending , and thus is exposed to any deterioration in credit quality that may have arisen from such efforts .
there are also concerns about frothy property markets and mounting inflation .
while none of these problems should be minimized , they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing . long fixated on stability , chinese policymakers have been quick to take preemptive action .
that is particularly evident in chinese officials ’ successful campaign against inflation .
administrative measures in the agricultural sector , aimed at alleviating supply bottlenecks for pork , cooking oil , fresh vegetables , and fertilizer , have pushed food-price inflation lower .
this is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate receded from 6.5 % in july 2011 to 4.2 % in november .
meanwhile , the people ’ s bank of china , which hiked benchmark one-year lending rates five times in the 12 months ending this october , to 6.5 % , now has plenty of scope for monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate .
the same is true with mandatory reserves in the banking sector , where the government has already pruned 50 basis points off the record 21.5 % requi@@ red-@@ reserve ratio .
relatively small fiscal deficits – only around 2 % of gdp in 2010 – leave china with an added dimension of policy flexibility should circumstances dictate .
nor has china been passive with respect to mounting speculative excesses in residential property .
in april 2010 , it implemented tough new regulations , raising down-payments from 20 % to 30 % for a first home , to 50 % for a second residence , and to 100 % for purchases of three or more units .
this strategy appears to be working .
in november , house prices declined in 49 of the 70 cities that china monitors monthly .
moreover , it is a serious exaggeration to claim , as many do today , that the chinese economy is one massive real-estate bubble .
yes , total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50 % of gdp , but residential and non@@ residential real estate , combined , accounts for only 15-20 % of that – no more than 10 % of the overall economy .
in terms of floor space , residential construction accounts for half of china ’ s real-estate investment .
identifying the share of residential real estate that goes to private developers in the dozen or so first-tier cities ( which account for most of the chinese property market ’ s fiz@@ z ) suggests that less than 1 % of gdp would be at risk in the event of a housing-market collapse – not exactly a recipe for a hard landing .
as for chinese banks , the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt , which , according to the government , totaled $ 1.7 trillion ( roughly 30 % of gdp ) at the end of 2010 .
approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis .
some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired , but ongoing urbanization – around 15-20 million people per year move to cities – provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction .
that tempers the risks to credit quality and , along with relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios of around 65 % , should cushion the chinese banking system .
india is more problematic .
as the only economy in asia with a current-account deficit , its external funding problems can hardly be taken lightly .
like china , india ’ s economic-growth momentum is ebbing .
but unlike china , the downshift is more pronounced – gdp growth fell through the 7 % threshold in the third calen@@ dar-@@ year quarter of 2011 , and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1 % in october .
but the real problem is that , in contrast to china , indian authorities have far less policy leeway .
for starters , the rupee is in near free-fall .
that means that the reserve bank of india – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-@@ serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy .
moreover , an outsize consolidated government budget deficit of around 9 % of gdp limits india ’ s fiscal-policy discretion .
while china is in better shape than india , neither economy is likely to implode on its own .
it would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in asia .
one obvious possibility today would be a disruptive breakup of the european monetary union .
in that case , both china and india , like most of the world ’ s economies , could find themselves in serious difficulty – with an outright contraction of chinese exports , as in late 2008 and early 2009 , and heightened external funding pressures for india .
while i remain a euro-skeptic , i believe that the political will to advance european integration will prevail .
consequently , i attach a low probability to the currency union ’ s disintegration .
barring such a worst-case outcome for europe , the odds of a hard landing in either india or china should remain low .
seduced by the political economy of false prosperity , the west has squandered its might .
driven by strategy and stability , asia has built on its newfound strength .
but now it must reinvent itself .
japanese-like stagnation in the developed world is challenging externally dependent asia to shift its focus to internal demand .
downside pressures currently squeezing china and india underscore that challenge .
asia ’ s defining moment could be hand .

why i published &apos; the tiananmen paper@@ s@@ &apos;
the chinese leadership ’ s penchant for secretiveness is proverbial .
but the veil that exists over how that omnipotent party makes important decisions is being lifted somewhat because a volume of unique materials about the behind-the-scenes events surrounding the infamous tiananmen massacre of 1989 is being published this month .
taken as a whole , these documents provide a rare glimpse into the modus operandi of china ’ s leaders .
as a witness and participant in the tiananmen events , and as someone with access to the historical archive , i felt it my duty to publish this record of the decisions that lay behind what happened .
the real truth of what happened in l9@@ 89 was locked in secret party archives in beijing for over a decade .
i chose to involve myself in this personally risky project because i believe those who wish to serve china must reflect deeply on the lessons of the tiananmen events .
despite undergoing great changes in the years since 1989 , china needs not only to reverse the verdict on the june 4th movement as &quot; a counter-revolutionary rebellion , &quot; but also to restart its stalled process of political reform and democratization .
although the massacre in tiananmen square of june 4 , 1989 happened over ten years ago , it has not faded from people &apos;s memories .
chinese history seems frozen at that date .
far too many questions about those events remain unanswered .
the first step in achieving an accurate , complete , and objective re-evaluation of what happened must involve , as deng xiaoping famously said , a &quot; search for truth in facts . &quot;
only then can the true face of history be restored .
i believe that the following four lessons should guide those who are working for change in china and have motivated my actions in this case .
first , even though the chinese communist regime has become thoroughly corrupt , it has strengthened itself through economic growth and improvement in people &apos;s lives .
these achievements have enabled it to intensify its organizational penetration into almost every corner of society .
no political force in china can stand up to it .
people who do not like what the party does must realize that they have nowhere else to turn ; they can rely only on themselves .
even though the end of communism in china may seem a foregone conclusion , the fall of the chinese communist party will be accomplished not by an outside force but only by its own members .
second , given the lock that the communist party holds on all the levers of power , the building of democracy in china depends on forces rooted inside china .
those who have worked overseas for democracy , freedom , and the rule of law and who have sought the support of the international community have done necessary work .
but real solutions to china &apos;s problems must be sought at home .
third , change from inside is possible because the chinese communist party today resembles the communist party of the soviet union around 1989 .
what looks on the outside like a solid structure can break into pieces overnight .
the chinese communist party has long since ceased to be a traditional communist party .
it is now a mélange of factions with diverse goals and differing ideologies .
the differences between radicals and conservatives in the party are now sharper than those between the party and its historic rival , the kuomintang .
the key force pushing for political change is the pro-democracy faction within the party .
so what will replace the chinese communist party will probably be a new force that emerges from inside the party ; a group that regrets the errors of the communist system , a group committed to establishing a healthy democracy .
this group will unite with forces of democratization both at home and abroad to establish a truly democratic system .
fourth , reversal of the verdict on june 4th is an historical inevitability , as well as the wish of most of china ’ s people .
june 4th weighs on the spirits of every chinese patriot ; almost every chinese person knows that official reevaluation is just a matter of time .
indeed , the party &apos;s top leadership has been divided about the event ever since it occurred .
today , many of those responsible for the decision to crack down - notably deng xiaoping and others of the party elders – have died .
so calls to reverse the verdict are growing , both inside and outside the party .
these calls will eventually form the mainstream , and the liberal forces within the party will undoubtedly respond by seizing a historic opportunity not only to reverse the verdict but to move toward discarding the communist system .
chinese democracy still has a long , hard road before it .
among other things , it needs a class of well-educated activists it lost when many young people left china to study and build a better life elsewhere .
even if risk and a large degree of self-sacrifice are required , these young people should return to join those in china , including those within the communist party , that are working for change .
as lu xun said , &quot; a true warrior dares to stare the sadness of life in the face and to see the blood that drips there . &quot;

why is america ’ s budget deficit so large ?
cambridge – america ’ s enormous budget deficit is now exceeded as a share of national income only by greece and egypt among all of the world ’ s major countries .
to be sure , the current deficit of 9.1 % of gdp is due in part to the automatic effects of the recession .
but , according to the official projections of the united states congressional budget office ( cbo ) , even after the economy returns to full employment , the deficit will remain so large that america ’ s national debt-to-gdp ratio will continue to rise for the rest of this decade and beyond .
understanding how to achieve us fiscal consolidation requires understanding why the budget deficit is projected to remain so high .
before looking at the projected future deficits , consider what happened in the first two years of president barack obama ’ s administration that caused the deficit to rise from 3.2 % of gdp in 2008 to 8.9 % of gdp in 2010 ( which in turn pushed up the national debt-to-gdp ratio from 40 % to 62 % ) .
the 5.7 % -of-gdp rise in the budget deficit reflected a 2.6 % -of-gdp fall in tax revenues ( from 17.5 % to 14.9 % of gdp ) and 3.1 % -of-gdp rise in outlays ( from 20.@@ 7 % to 23.8 % of gdp ) .
according to the cbo , less than half of the 5.7 % -of-gdp increase in the budget deficit was the result of the economic downturn , as the automatic stabilizers added 2.5 % of gdp to the rise in the deficit between 2008 and 2010 .
the cbo analysis calls the changes in the budget deficit induced by cyclical conditions “ automatic stabilizers , ” on the theory that the revenue decline and expenditure increase ( mainly for unemployment benefits and other transfer payments ) caused by an economic downturn contribute to aggregate demand and thus help to stabilize the economy .
in other words , even without the automatic stabilizers – that is , if the economy had been at full employment in 2008-2010 – the us budget deficit still would have increased by 3.2 % of gdp .
lower revenue and increased outlays each account for about half of this “ full-employment ” rise in the deficit .
looking ahead , the cbo projects that enacting the budget proposed by the obama administration in february would add $ 3.8 trillion to the national debt between 2010 and 2020 , causing the debt-to-gdp ratio to soar from 62 % to 90 % .
that $ 3.8 trillion net debt increase reflects a roughly $ 5 trillion increase in the deficit , owing to higher spending and weaker revenues from middle- and lower-income taxpayers , offset in part by $ 1.3 trillion in tax increases , primarily on high-income earners .
even this enormous increase in the projected deficits and debt underestimates the fiscal damage that the obama administration ’ s budget , if enacted , would inflict .
the annual level of defense spending is projected to decline by about $ 50 billion in each year after 2012 – a very optimistic view of us military needs in the decade ahead .
shrinking america ’ s budget deficit to prevent a further rise in the debt-to-gdp ratio from its current level will require reduced spending and increased revenue .
that increase in revenue can be achieved without raising marginal tax rates , namely by limiting the amount of tax reduction that individuals and businesses can achieve from the various “ tax expenditures ” that form an important part of the us tax code .
but that is a subject for another column .
on the expenditure side , however , the prospect that the national debt could double during the next decade is just the start of the fiscal problem that the us now faces .
the budget outlook in subsequent decades is dominated by the increasing costs of social security and medicare benefits , which are projected to take the debt-to-gdp ratio from 90 % in 2020 to 190 % in 2035 .
fundamental reform of these programs is the primary challenge for america ’ s public finances – and thus for the long-term health of the us economy .

why is china booming ?
providence , r.i. – china is now celebrating the 30th anniversary of the period officially known as “ reform and opening . ”
labeling time in this way echoes china ’ s imperial history .
during moments of political transition – a military victory , for example – the emperor might designate a special “ era name ” to help celebrate the good news .
or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle , in an effort to wipe the slate clean .
the last emperor of the tang dynasty proclaimed seven era names in fourteen years , as he sought in vain to “ re-@@ brand ” his reign and avoid his regime ’ s demise .
deng xiaoping began to champion “ reform and opening ” in 1978 . “ reform ” suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life , undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism , as an antidote to mao zedong ’ s ideology of “ revolution . ”
similarly , “ opening ” heralded the prc ’ s integration into the world community – especially the capitalist west .
deng ’ s principles still guide policy today .
one must go back to the qing dynasty ( 1644-1912 ) and its 60-year era of “ heavenly flourishing ” ( qianlong ) in the eighteenth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy .
the era of “ reform and opening ” has outlived its “ emperor ” by more than a decade , and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from deng to jiang zemin and hu jintao .
even the largest popular challenge the chinese communist party ever faced , the demonstrations of 1989 , now looks like a blip that helped deng consolidate support for his model of development .
if one factor undergirds china ’ s commitment to “ reform and opening , ” it is the extraordinary macroeconomic changes of the past 30 years .
in china , people call it fazhan , or “ development , ” but in much of rest of the world , it is more commonly described simply as the “ china boom , ” or the “ china miracle . ”
the boom began in the countryside in the late 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , and was followed by today ’ s urban , industrial-@@ led growth .
indeed , there have been many smaller “ booms ” – in consumption , foreign direct investment , domestic stock markets , trade , travel , overseas study , military modernization , and international diplomacy .
there is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste , and booming interest in religion – from buddhism to pent@@ eco@@ stal christianity – and in confucian philosophy .
little in china today speaks of moderation .
a leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influx of women into the workforce , particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south .
another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives , he believes , from the fact that chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise .
whatever the cause , the boom seems an unlikely capstone to a century of war , ferment , and revolution , and only adds to the sense of discontinuity that characterizes modern china .
certainly , few observers looking in 1978 at the smoldering embers of the cultural revolution , or at the seeming ru@@ ination of the post-1989 years , thought china would emerge as the lightning rod of the world ’ s developmental hopes .
paradoxically , the apparently discontinuous and contradictory nature of the “ era of reform and opening ” may actually help explain how china ’ s boom came about .
the tumult of the maoist period instilled in a broad cross-section of people a profound appreciation for stability , and a yearning to be left alone .
deng capitalized on this revolution@@ -@@ weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people ’ s private lives and freeing them to release their pent-up energy to pursue their own goals .
revolutionary communism may well have cleared the path for the boom in other ways as well , suggesting that the shift from socialist utopianism to capitalist pragmatism was less a u-turn than a sequential process of “ creative destruction . ”
after all , mao ’ s cultural revolution against “ feudal society ” did raze much of the cultural landscape , denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions , but also of failed socialist efforts , leaving china ready for the seeds of capitalist development .
mao ’ s revolution fueled countless rectification movements and campaigns that inverted the once-@@ inviolate primacy of ruler over ruled , scholar over worker , husband over wife , father over son , and family over individual .
by the time of the reforms of the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , bonds tying individuals to culture , the state , the work unit , and household-registration systems , for example , had largely unraveled .
the path had been cleared for a vast new population of atomized entrepreneurs and laborers , freed from fealty to family and party , to storm the marketplace with newly liberated individual energy .
of course , the boom ’ s costs should not be discounted .
environmental damage has been staggering , the gap between rich and poor has been growing , and urbanization – with all its attendant problems – has surged .
and , at least so far , the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped .
but still , a key question remains unanswered : why did china ’ s boom happen ?
this is one of the great questions of our time , relevant not only to china ’ s future , but to scores of other developing countries enthralled by china ’ s extraordinary , but still largely unexplained , success .

why is france burning ?
the urban disturbances in france have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968 .
the analogy is misleading .
while the 1968 protests challenged the french republican model to live up to its finest aspirations , today ’ s crisis challenges the french revolution ’ s model of citizenship and integration itself .
the french republican model asserts that all french citizens have the same cultural identity . indeed , this is the only acceptable identity .
to achieve this shared identity , all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum .
all this is not only fostered by the state , but also requires the kind of uniformity that only a centralized state can impose .
indeed , the french revolution ’ s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the nineteenth century , advocating federalism was a capital offense .
three components of this model incited today ’ s crisis and make it difficult for the french republic to address it effectively .
the first component is the classic french republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity , religion , and even social class .
collecting these data would , it is argued , violate the republican tenet that france is “ one and indivisible . ”
but the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data , like the uk-style , four-fold class analysis ( plus examination of patterns of unemployment by ethnicity or religion ) , makes it hard for social workers , public heath officials , and economic planners to diagnose new problems .
without the necessary data for analysis , public health policies , for example , cannot be directed toward groups that are especially disadvantaged or otherwise at risk .
like the prohibition of fine-tuned data – without which positive discrimination is in any case impossible – affirmative action is seen as damaging to the republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences .
the third component is the post-@@ welfare state , which is now part of the french model of citizenship and guarantees all full-time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer-paid benefits .
this makes it extremely difficult to let workers go , which makes employers reluctant to hire new people in the first place .
many of the social-democratic countries of europe , like sweden , holland , and denmark , created similar norms in their full-employment eras .
unlike france , however , they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment , and to invest socially and politically , not only in excellent job-training programs , but in job creation , and , just as importantly , in job-placement schemes .
france is now very bad at creating new jobs .
it has few training programs , but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restrictions against firing workers .
put all of this together , and it is like slamming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work .
this is the primary cause of the 30-50 % unemployment rates among minorities aged 16-24 in many french “ urban zones of sensitivity . ”
thus , the riots that france is now seeing emerge from french policies , not from instig@@ ations by islamists .
but few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the french model of citizenship .
indeed , they confidently wait for assimilation to kick in .
but in today ’ s high unemployment , low job-creation , and now multicultural france , assimilation will not occur without big changes .
france is only now beginning to come to grips with the crisis of its republican model of equal citizenship .
a newly created minister of social cohesion has begun to commission studies documenting discrimination .
one study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants , those with an islamic-@@ sounding name , and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb , had only one-fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a french-@@ sounding name and a “ safe ” address .
two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them , for the first time ever , to document , and then redress , their discriminatory employment practices .
fortunately , organized muslim leaders so far have not aggravated the rioting .
of course , the government ’ s reduction of community policing in favor of paramilitary forces stationed in quasi-military barracks , and the minister of interior ’ s description of the young rioters as “ scum ” who should be washed away with an industrial power hose , has not helped .
the french republican model enshrines the laudable abstract principles of liberty , equality , and fraternity .
however , so long as second- and third-generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is french , but are not in fact accepted as french – indeed , are blocked from enjoying the full rights of french citizenship – the republican model will fuel alienation rather than democratic integration .

new york – deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul , dhaka , and baghdad demonstrate the murderous reach of the islamic state ( isis ) in europe , north africa , the middle east , and parts of asia .
the longer isis maintains its strongholds in syria and iraq , the longer its terrorist network will create such carnage .
yet isis is not especially difficult to defeat .
the problem is that none of the states involved in iraq and syria , including the united states and its allies , has so far treated isis as its primary foe .
it ’ s time they do .
isis has a small fighting force , which the us puts at 20,000 to 25,000 in iraq and syria , and another 5,000 or so in libya .
compared to the number of active military personnel in syria ( 125,000 ) , iraq ( 27@@ 1,500 ) , saudi arabia ( 23@@ 3,500 ) , turkey ( 5@@ 10,@@ 600 ) , or iran ( 523,000 ) , isis is minuscule .
despite us president barack obama ’ s pledge in september 2014 to “ degrade and ultimately destroy ” isis , the us and its allies , including saudi arabia , turkey , and israel ( behind the scenes ) , have been focusing instead on toppling syria ’ s bashar al-assad .
israel opposes isis , but israel ’ s greater concern is assad ’ s iranian backing .
assad enables iran to support two paramilitary foes of israel , hezbollah and hamas .
israel therefore prioritizes the removal of assad over the defeat of isis .
for the us , steered by neoconservatives , the war in syria is a continuation of the plan for global us hegemony launched by defense secretary richard cheney and under secretary paul wolfowitz at the cold war ’ s end .
in 1991 , wolfowitz told us general wesley clark :
“ but one thing we did learn &#91; from the persian gulf war &#93; is that we can use our military in the region – in the middle east – and the soviets won ’ t stop us .
and we ’ ve got about 5 or 10 years to clean up those old soviet regimes – syria , iran ( sic ) , iraq – before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us . ”
the multiple us wars in the middle east – afghanistan , iraq , syria , libya , and others – have sought to remove the soviet union , and then russia , from the scene and to give the us hegemonic sway .
these efforts have failed miserably .
for saudi arabia , as for israel , the main goal is to oust assad in order to weaken iran .
syria is part of the extensive proxy war between shia iran and sunni saudi arabia that plays out in the battlefields of syria and yemen and in bitter shia-sunni confrontations in bahrain and other divided countries in the region ( including saudi arabia itself ) .
for turkey , the overthrow of assad would bolster its regional standing .
yet turkey now faces three foes on its southern border : assad , isis , and nationalist kurds .
isis has so far taken a back seat to turkey ’ s concerns about assad and the kurds .
but isis-@@ directed terrorist attacks in turkey may be changing that .
russia and iran , too , have pursued their own regional interests , including through proxy wars and support for paramilitary operations .
yet both have signaled their readiness to cooperate with the us to defeat isis , and perhaps to solve other problems as well .
the us has so far spurned these offers , because of its focus on toppling assad .
the us foreign-policy establishment blames russian president vladimir putin for defending assad , while russia blames the us for trying to overthrow him .
these complaints might seem symmetrical , but they ’ re not .
the attempt by the us and its allies to overthrow assad violates the un charter , while russia ’ s support of assad is consistent with syria ’ s right of self-defense under that charter .
yes , assad is a despot , but the un charter does not give license to any country to choose which despots to depose .
the persistence of isis underscores three strategic flaws in us foreign policy , along with a fatal tactical flaw .
first , the neocon quest for us hegemony through regime change is not only bloody-minded arrogance ; it is classic imperial overreach .
it has failed everywhere the us has tried it .
syria and libya are the latest examples .
second , the cia has long armed and trained sunni jihadists through covert operations funded by saudi arabia .
in turn , these jihadists gave birth to isis , which is a direct , if unanticipated , consequence of the policies pursued by the cia and its saudi partners .
third , the us perception of iran and russia as implacable foes of america is in many ways outdated and a self-fulfilling prophecy . a rapprochement with both countries is possible .
fourth , on the tactical side , the us attempt to fight a two-front war against both assad and isis has failed .
whenever assad has been weakened , sunni jihadists , including isis and al-nusra front , have filled the vacuum .
assad and his iraqi counterparts can defeat isis if the us , russia , saudi arabia , and iran provide air cover and logistical support .
yes , assad would remain in power ; yes , russia would retain an ally in syria ; and yes , iran would have influence there .
terrorist attacks would no doubt continue , perhaps even in the name of isis for a while ; but the group would be denied its base of operations in syria and iraq .
such an outcome would not only end isis on the ground in the middle east ; it could lay the groundwork for reducing regional tensions more generally .
the us and russia could begin to reverse their recent new cold war through shared efforts to stamp out jihadist terrorism .
( a pledge that nato will not offer admission to ukraine or escalate missile defenses in eastern europe would also help . )
there ’ s more .
a cooperative approach to defeating isis would give saudi arabia and turkey reason and opportunity to find a new modus vivendi with iran .
israel ’ s security could be enhanced by bringing iran into a cooperative economic and geopolitical relationship with the west , in turn enhancing the chances for a long-overdue two-state settlement with palestine .
the rise of isis is a symptom of the shortcomings of current western – particularly us – strategy .
the west can defeat isis .
the question is whether the us will undertake the strategic reassessment needed to accomplish that end .

why is rape different ?
new york – as swedish prosecutors ’ sex-crime allegations against wikileaks founder julian assange play out in the international media , one convention of the coverage merits serious scrutiny .
we know assange by name .
but his accusers – the two swedish women who have brought the complaints against him – are consistently identified only as “ miss a ” and “ miss w , ” and their images are blurred .
news organizations argue that the policy is motivated by respect for the alleged victims .
but the same organizations would never report charges of , say , fraud – or , indeed , non-sexual assault – against a suspect who has been named on the basis on anonymous accusations .
in fact , despite its good intentions , providing anonymity in sex-crime cases is extremely harmful to women .
the convention of not naming rape accusers is a relic of the victorian period , when rape and other sex crimes were being codified and reported in ways that prefigure our own era .
rape was seen as “ the fate worse than death , ” rendering women – who were supposed to be virgins until marriage – “ damaged goods . ”
virginia wool@@ f called the ideal of womanhood in this period “ the angel in the house ” : a retiring , fragile creature who could not withstand the rigors of the public arena .
of course , this ideal was a double-edged sword : their ostensible fragility – and their assigned role as icons of sexual purity and ignorance – was used to exclude women from influencing outcomes that affected their own destinies .
for example , women could not fully participate under their own names in legal proceedings .
indeed , one of the rights for which suffra@@ gi@@ sts fought was the right to be convicted of one ’ s own crimes .
nonetheless , even after women gained legal rights – and even as other assumptions about women have gone the way of smelling salts and wh@@ al@@ eb@@ one stays – the condescending victorian convention of not identifying women who make sex-crime charges remains with us .
that convention not only is an insult to women , but also makes rape prosecutions far more difficult .
overwhelmingly , anonymity serves institutions that do not want to prosecute rapists or sexual harassers .
the united states military , for instance , hides rape accusers ’ identities , and the prevalence of rape in the us armed forces today is off the charts .
maintaining anonymous charges enables the military authorities to avoid keeping comprehensive records , which in turn allows officials to evade responsibility for transparent reporting of assaults and of prosecutions – and thus not to prosecute sex crime in any serious , systematic way .
the same is true with universities .
my alma mater , yale , used anonymity in reporting of sex harassment and rape to sweep sex-crime incidents and repeat offenders ’ records under the rug for two decades , thereby protecting its own interest in preventing systematic investigation .
because of the prevalence of universities ’ anonymity policy , at least two alleged serial rapists – whose assaults were reported to their employers separately by more than one victim – are teaching at new universities , with no charges ever brought against them .
the lesson is clear : when charges are made anonymously , no one takes them as seriously as charges brought in public , resulting in institutionalized impunity for sexual predators .
indeed , only when victims have stood up and stated their names – granted , a difficult and often painful thing to do – have institutional change and successful prosecutions been possible .
anita hill ’ s decision in 1991 not to make anonymous accusations against clarence thomas , now a us supreme court justice , spurred a wave of enforcement of equal-@@ employment-@@ opportunity law .
hill knew that her motives would be questioned .
but , as a lawyer , she understood how unethical anonymous allegations are – and how unlikely they are to bring about real consequences .
in fact , the convention of anonymity merely allows rape myths to flourish .
when victims are not kept hidden , it becomes much clearer that rape can happen to anyone – grandmothers and students , homemakers and prostitutes .
instead , we have stereotypes about how “ real ” rape victims must look and act in order to be taken seriously .
and we have the myth of higher false reporting of rape relative to other crimes ( in the us , the rate is no different : 2-4 % ) .
feminists have long argued that rape must be treated like any other crime .
but in no other crime are accusers kept behind a wall of anonymity . treating rape so differently serves only to maintain its mischaracteri@@ zation as a “ different ” kind of crime , loaded with cultural baggage and projections .
finally , there is a profound moral issue at stake .
though children ’ s identities should , of course , be shielded in sex-crime allegations , women are not children .
if one makes a serious criminal accusation , one must wish to be treated – and one must treat oneself – as a moral adult .
that is why justice systems – at least in democracies – typically demand that the accused be able to face his or her accuser .
why , for example , in a case that is so dependent on public opinion – and on which so much depends – must assange face allegations that may have grave consequences for him , while his accusers remain hidden ?
so-called “ rape shield ” laws should be used to protect alleged victims . it is no one ’ s business whom a victim has slept with previously , or what she was wearing when she was attacked .
nor should it be .
after all , motive and context are legitimate questions in any serious criminal allegation .
hill , for example , knew that she would have to explain why she waited years to accuse thomas , her former employer .
likewise , adult accusers of church-@@ protected sex criminals knew that they would have to answer fundamental questions ( notably , many of them have identified themselves , which has helped get real prosecutions ) .
it is wrong – and sexist – to treat female sex-crime accusers as if they were children , and it is wrong to try anyone , male or female , in the court of public opinion on the basis of anonymous accusations .

why is the us presidential race so close ?
washington , dc – many people around the world are probably wondering why hillary clinton – who is obviously more prepared and better suited for the american presidency than her opponent , donald trump – isn ’ t wal@@ tz@@ ing to victory .
many americans share the world ’ s bewilderment .
national opinion polls may well continue to fluctuate until the election on november 8 .
but trump has been closing in on clinton in recent weeks , even threatening to catch up with her in the electoral college vote , where the democrats ’ control of some of the most populous states ( new york and california ) give clinton an advantage .
why is this happening ?
for starters , trump , despite knowing almost nothing about governance or public policy , has managed to consolidate most republicans behind him .
one motivation is republicans ’ long-held hatred of clinton .
another is the supreme court ; the court already has one vacant seat for the next president to fill and is likely to have more over the next four years .
trump has also exploited many americans ’ economic anxieties , tapping the same anti-immigrant , anti-elite rage that is sweeping across european countries .
but trump cannot win by appealing only to white men without a college degree .
so he has been clumsily trying to suggest that he also cares about african americans and latinos – not by talking to african-american and latino voters , but by speaking in exaggerated stereotypes about them to white audiences .
not surprisingly , african-americans and latinos consider his comments insensitive and patronizing ; white women – his real target audience – haven ’ t yet been persuaded , either .
meanwhile , clinton is having her own difficulties reconstructing president barack obama ’ s coalition of women , african americans , latinos , and millennials .
many young people who passionately supported clinton ’ s democratic primary opponent , senator bernie sanders , have ignored sanders ’ s own admonitions to support clinton , and are saying that they ’ ll vote for third-party candidates , which would help trump .
since the two major parties ’ national conventions in july , each candidate has alternately made gains and suffered losses .
this month , just as trump was rising in the polls , he attempted to separate himself from the racist “ birther ” movement , which falsely claims that obama – america ’ s first black president – wasn ’ t born in the united states , and thus was ineligible for the presidency .
trump ’ s remarks , terse and grudging , reminded everyone that he himself was one of the loudest “ bir@@ thers ” of all .
his damage-control effort further backfired , because he falsely claimed that clinton and her 2008 presidential campaign had started the birther rumor .
many news outlets finally used the word “ lie ” in their coverage of trump , who had gone essentially unchallenged on past fabrications .
trump ’ s recent polling gains say less about his improvement as a candidate than they do about clinton ’ s own weaknesses and bad luck .
outside her base of passionate loyalists , clinton has always had a voter-@@ enthusiasm problem .
she comes across to many as a packaged know-it-all , the super-smart girl who put off the boys in school .
and she confronts a fair amount of sexism , even among her supporters .
( a former democratic governor recently declared that she should smile more .
would he have said that about a man ? )
but clinton has also created some of her own problems .
her poor judgment in using a private email server as secretary of state , thereby risking the disclosure of classified material , has become a chronic burden for her campaign .
she compounded the problem when she claimed , falsely , that her predecessors had done the same thing , and that state department security officials had cleared it .
and , unlike trump , she received no deference from the press on this issue .
the email saga added to voters ’ long-held impression that clinton isn ’ t “ honest and trustworthy , ” and it exposed her to attacks from adversaries on the right .
the highly conservative advocacy group judicial watch has continually called attention to the issue , forcing the disclosure of emails that clinton hadn ’ t turned over to the state department .
( the fbi found nearly 15,000 emails on clinton ’ s server that she hadn ’ t provided . )
numerous as-yet-@@ undisclosed emails with the potential to damage clinton may well be released before the election .
while fbi director james comey decided not to recommend prosecution of clinton for the email issue , he hurt her campaign by commenting that she ’ d been “ extremely careless . ”
in any case , the choice not to prosecute had republicans and conservative commentators howling that she ’ d received preferential treatment from the democratic administration .
polls showed that 56 % of respondents agreed that clinton should have been prosecuted .
a new issue for clinton arose in august , when the associated press reported that numerous donors to the clinton foundation had received special treatment by the state department during clinton ’ s tenure there , mainly by winning an appointment with her .
but many of these people would have received an appointment anyway ; and there is no evidence that state department policies were changed as a result .
meanwhile , the washington post has begun to report on questionable – possibly illegal – expenditures by trump ’ s own charitable foundation .
trump , who hadn ’ t donated to his foundation since 2008 , subsequently used its funds to buy personal items ( including a six-@@ foot portrait of himself ) and to pay legal settlements .
previously , it had also been disclosed that funds from the trump foundation had been used to contribute to the election campaigns of attorne@@ y@@ s-general in florida and texas , which would also be illegal .
finally , clinton had the bad luck of falling ill , with cellphone video showing her nearly collapsing as she left early a ceremony in new york city commemorating the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack .
this added further fuel to right-wing media speculation that she is in poor health ; trump added the sexist charge that she lacks the “ stamina ” to be president .
the press covering clinton were furious to learn that two@@ days earlier she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and had kept it to herself .
a later poll showed that the majority of the public agreed .
clinton ’ s four-day convalescence came just as she was preparing to make the case for why people should vote for her , rather than why they shouldn ’ t vote for trump .
just as she resumed campaigning , there were bombings in new york and new jersey , and two more police shootings of unarmed african americans , which spurred demonstrations in north carolina , a swing state .
the events took over the national dialogue , with trump , as usual , playing on racial divisions and blaming obama and clinton .
this is the background against which the candidates will head into face-to-face debates , which tend to play a large ( even excessive ) role in shaping us elections .
it would be unwise to call this election over before it is .

why marx was wrong
stockholm – the bicentennial of karl marx ’ s birth has occasioned a surge of interest in the man ’ s work , complete with the unveiling of a statue in his hometown of trier , germany .
at a celebration of marxism in beijing last week , chinese president xi jinping declared that , “ like a spectacular sunrise , the theory illuminated the path of humanity ’ s exploration of the law of history , and humanity ’ s search for &#91; its &#93; own liberation . ”
he would go on to claim that marx “ pointed out the direction , with scientific theory , toward an ideal society with no oppression or exploitation , where every person would enjoy equality and freedom . ”
given that xi ’ s words were uttered in “ marxist ” china , those in attendance had no choice but to agree with them .
yet , speaking in trier on the same day , european commission president jean-claude juncker offered a somewhat generous appraisal of his own : “ today he stands for things which is he not responsible for and which he didn ’ t cause , because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite . ”
it is not entirely clear what juncker meant by this .
marxism , after all , has inflicted untold misery on tens of millions of people who have been forced to live under regimes waving its banner .
for much of the twentieth century , 40 % of humanity suffered famines , gulags , censorship , and other forms of repression at the hands of self-proclaimed marxists .
in his speech , juncker seemed to be alluding to the standard counterargument : that communist atrocities throughout the twentieth century were due to some sort of distortion of marx ’ s thought , for which the man himself can scarcely be held responsible .
is there anything to this argument ?
marx spent most of his life analyzing the political economy of the industrializing mid-nineteenth-century west .
but his enduring relevance owes more to his ideas for the future , and the implications they would have for society .
in considering his legacy , this area of his thought cannot be ignored .
marx regarded private property as the source of all evil in the emerging capitalist societies of his day .
accordingly , he believed that only by abolishing it could society ’ s class divisions be healed , and a harmonious future ensured .
under communism , his collaborator friedrich engels later claimed , the state itself would become unnecessary and “ wither away . ”
these assertions were not made as speculation , but rather as scientific claims about what the future held in store .
but , of course , it was all rubbish , and marx ’ s theory of history – dialectical materialism – has since been proved wrong and dangerous in practically every respect .
the great twentieth-century philosopher karl popper , one of marx ’ s strongest critics , rightly called him a “ false prophet . ” and , if more evidence were needed , the countries that embraced capitalism in the twentieth century went on to become democratic , open , and prosperous societies .
by contrast , every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of marxism has failed – and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doctrinal misunderstanding on the part of marx ’ s followers .
by abolishing private ownership and establishing state control of the economy , one not only deprives society of the entrepreneurship needed to propel it forward ; one also abolishes freedom itself .
because marxism treats all contradictions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does , dissent after the establishment of communism is impossible .
by definition , any challenge to the new order must be an illegitimate remnant of the oppressive order that came before .
thus , marxist regimes have in fact been logical extensions of his doctrines .
of course juncker is right that marx – who died 34 years before the russian revolution – was not responsible for the gulag , and yet his ideas clearly were .
in his landmark three-volume study main currents of marxism , the polish philosopher leszek kołakowski , who became a leading critic of marxism after having embraced it in his youth , notes that marx showed almost no interest in people as they actually exist .
kołakowski ’ s insight helps to explain why regimes that have embraced marx ’ s mechanical and deterministic doctrine inevitably must turn to totalitarianism when confronting the reality of a complex society .
they have not always fully succeeded ; but the results have always been tragic .
for his part , xi views china ’ s economic development over the past few decades as “ cast iron proof ” of marxism ’ s continued validity .
remember that it was the china of pure communism that produced the famine and terror of the “ great leap forward ” and the “ cultural revolution . ” mao ’ s decision to deprive farmers of their land and entrepreneurs of their firms had predictably disastrous results , and the communist party of china has since abandoned that doctrinaire approach .
under mao ’ s successor , deng xiaoping , the cpc launched china ’ s great economic “ opening-up . ”
after 1978 , it began to restore private ownership and permit entrepreneurship , and the results have been nothing short of spectacular .
if china ’ s development is being held back by anything today , it is the remnants of marxism that are still visible in inefficient state-owned enterprises and the repression of dissent .
china ’ s centralized single-party system is simply incompatible with a modern and diverse society .
two hundred years after marx ’ s birth , it is certainly wise to reflect on his intellectual legacy .
we should do so not in celebration , however , but to inoculate our open societies against the totalitarian temptation that lurks in his false theories .

why mexico is sick
our home is far , far away from us . ”
that ’ s how it feels to live in mexico nowadays : far from democratic normalcy ; far from a health system that inspires confidence ; far from a government that builds trust ; far from home and close to everything that imperils it .
my homeland has become a place where too many people are victims , succumbing to a virus , or gunned down by a drug-@@ trafficker ; assaulted by a robber , shot by an ill-trained policeman , or kidnapped by a member of a criminal gang .
the flu epidemic , which probably began in the southern state of veracruz , is yet another sign that all is not well in mexico .
the country seems to be caught in a permanent , uneasy tug-of-war between the past and the future , between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path .
for example , when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases , it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities , because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations .
mexico faces mid-term elections for congress in the fall , and president felipe calderón ’ s national action party is trailing slightly in the polls over its main rivals , who would like nothing better than to see a health emergency translate into a political defeat .
in the face of a public health system that seemed incapable of diagnosing and treating the outbreak quickly , the government felt it had little choice but to shut down mexico city , dealing a severe blow to an already crippled economy .
in contrast with mexico ’ s authoritarian past , when an “ imperial presidency ” constituted a major obstacle to modernization , power has been dispersed .
what the executive branch has relinquished , or been forced to give up , vested interests have seized .
the problem is no longer too much power in the president ’ s hands , but too much power in the hands of “ veto centers ” – including public-sector unions – that are blocking much-needed reforms , including in the health system .
in all likelihood , the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union recalcitrance .
the flu also revealed some of mexico ’ s other fundamental flaws .
the political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian remnants and newly established mechanisms for transparency .
the electoral process has been unable to guarantee decent democratic governance , rein in predatory practices among the political class , or make public officials follow established rules , keep them responsive to citizen preferences , and deter them from channeling public funds into private hands .
lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished .
impunity , in turn , erodes the credibility of the country ’ s institutions , including public hospitals and clinics .
today , conspiracy theories abound in mexico about the origins of the virus , because government officials are viewed with such ingrained suspicion .
throughout the epidemic , citizens have largely obeyed government guidelines and followed public health prescriptions .
but that doesn ’ t mean they trust the government .
public-opinion polls reveal that more than 50 % of the population believe that political parties are “ not necessary ” for the good of the country .
disapproval of congress is growing , and people ’ s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased .
in the midst of the epidemic , 66 % of mexicans believe that the country is regressing .
seventy-five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities , and 98 % of crimes are never resolved or punished .
public opinion seems disenchanted with a democracy incapable of offering tangible solutions to problems , the flu crisis being the most recent example .
saddled by a viral infection , drug-related insecurity , and rising crime , mexico feels like a besieged place .
the noted columnist miguel angel granados chapa wrote last week : “ all that ’ s missing is for mexico to get pe@@ ed on by a dog . ”
mexico ’ s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu .
over the past ten years , political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform , condemning mexico to move sideways , even as other emerging markets surge ahead .
lately , political battles among key actors have not been about how to build a more effective of representative political system or a more equitable , dynamic economy , but about how to maintain control of accumulated power or distribute it among their allies .
political parties appear far removed from citizen demands , beset by internal divisions , incapable of addressing deep-rooted inequality and lawlessness , and prone to populist or authoritarian leadership that promises quick fixes to entrenched problems .
mexico ’ s current quandary is the flu , but it faces more important challenges than a mutating microbe .
with more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in drug-related violence last year , mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light : a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently insensitive to their plight .
in this national crisis , mexico ’ s people have closed ranks , collaborated , and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest .
but their political and economic elites frequently seem incapable of doing so .
that is why home seems far , far away for so many mexicans .

why more migration makes sense
oxford – in almost every rich country , anti-immigrant fervor is at fever pitch .
but it is a malady that must be resisted if these societies are to continue to prosper and developing countries are to fight poverty and sustain economic growth .
a higher rate of global migration is desirable for four reasons : it is a source of innovation and dynamism ; it responds to labor shortages ; it meets the challenges posed by rapidly aging populations ; and it provides an escape from poverty and persecution .
by contrast , limiting migration slows economic growth and undermines societies ’ long-term competitiveness .
it also creates a less prosperous , more unequal , and partitioned world .
of course , there are short-run , local costs to higher rates of migration that must be addressed if societies are to enjoy the much larger long-term benefits .
and yet , despite domestic opposition in recipient countries , the number of international migrants has doubled over the past 25 years , and will double again by 2030 .
rapid economic and political change – and , increasingly , environmental change – dis@@ lo@@ dges people and encourages them to seek opportunity and security in new homes .
against the backdrop of rapid globalization , the individual risks and costs of moving internationally will continue to fall .
the combination of the estimated increase in the world ’ s population by two billion people , lower transport costs , better connectivity , and growing transnational social and economic networks could and should lead to increased movement of people .
if this process is allowed to take its course , it will stimulate global growth and serve to reduce poverty .
and yet , while the incremental reduction of barriers to cross-border flows of capital , goods , and services has been a major achievement of recent decades , international migration has never been more strictly controlled .
the classical economists such as john stuart mill saw this as both economically illogical and ethically unacceptable .
adam smith objected to anything that obstructed “ the free circulation of labor from one employment to another . ”
by the nineteenth century , the development of steam and other transport meant that one-third of the population of scandinavia , ireland , and parts of italy emigrated .
mass migration gave millions of europeans an escape route from poverty and persecution , and fed the dynamism and development of countries like the united states , the united kingdom , and various colonies .
the rise of nationalism prior to the outbreak of world war i led to the widespread introduction of passports and ushered in stricter controls on the international movement of people .
a hundred years later , despite falling barriers to trade , finance , and information , the walls to free mobility have been built higher .
approximately 200 million people , around 3 % of the world ’ s population , now live in countries in which they were not born .
these are the orphans of the international system .
in our book exceptional people , we demonstrate that , on balance , they bring great benefit to their host societies .
in addition to providing a much-needed source of skilled and unskilled labor , they contribute disproportionately to innovation and wealth creation .
for example , immigrants to the us contribute more than half of the patents and silicon valley start-ups .
they also contribute more in tax than they claim through social-welfare benefits or other payments .
medical and public health advances have increased longevity in developed countries , while persistently low fertility levels and the end of the post-wwii baby boom mean that the number of native-born workers will fall in the coming years .
as countries ’ populations age and their fertility rates collapse , more migration will be necessary to ensure economic competitiveness and finance pension and health-care systems .
the effects of a shrinking labor force will be compounded by rising educational attainment in developed countries , which will leave fewer people interested in taking on low-skilled service jobs or in working in the trades and construction .
between 2005 and 2025 , oecd countries are expected to experience a 35 % increase in the percentage of their workforces with tertiary education .
as education levels rise , so do expectations about work .
for the countries they leave , migrants often represent a brain drain .
even so , they contribute significantly to their home countries .
taiwan and israel are testimony to the role played by migrants abroad , with their diasporas playing a vital role in terms of political support , investment flows , and technology transfer .
moreover , migration has historically been the most effective measure against poverty .
remittances sent home by migrants exceeded $ 440 billion in 2010 , with over two-thirds of these flows going to developing countries .
in a number of small developing countries , remittances contribute more than one-third of gdp , and in a number of larger countries , annual receipts exceed $ 50 billion .
in latin america and the caribbean , more than 50 million people are supported by remittances , and the numbers are even greater in africa and asia .
both rich and poor countries would benefit from increased migration , with developing countries benefiting the most .
it is estimated that increasing migration by just 3 % of the workforce in developed countries between 2005 and 2025 would generate global gains of $ 356 billion , more than two-thirds of which would accrue to developing countries .
opening borders completely could produce gains as high as $ 39 trillion for the world economy over 25 years .
there has been much discussion of the need to complete the doha round of global trade negotiations and increase development assistance to poor countries .
while these actions are vital , putting migration reform on the agenda is as important – a small increase in migration would yield a much greater boon to the global economy and developing countries than the combined benefits of aid and trade reform .
today , powerful countries argue against migration reform and the development of a rules-based global migration organization .
but more migration is in everyone ’ s interest , and the public debate about it is too important to be left to politicians .
deep thinking needs to be followed by bold action .

why musharraf survives
recent threats by the bush administration to cut off billions of dollars in aid to pakistan have sparked panic in government circles .
likewise , according to the pakistani ambassador in washington , military strikes by the united states aimed at al-qaeda and taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas would destabilize pakistan and “ possibly could bring &#91; general pervez musharraf &#93; down . ”
but how worried should the pakistani authorities really be in the face of growing us pressure to root out islamic militants ?
occasional frustrations notwithstanding , it is , in fact , unlikely that the us will turn against a faithful – and dependent – ally , especially one whose leader enjoys cordial personal relations with bush .
nor , due to a lack of organized opposition , will public anger at musharraf ’ s pro-us policy destabilize his regime .
indeed , the wily general-@@ president does not merely survive crisis after crisis , but has thrived in power .
how does he do it ?
the answer lies in a finely honed strategy , perfected over years , that ju@@ ggles us demands and the interests of local intelligence chiefs , mullahs , tribal leaders , venal politicians , and a host of fortune seekers .
webs of intrigue and murky players obscure details , but the priorities are unmistakeable .
first , american impatience must be held in check .
pakistan is expected to deliver results on al-qaeda and the taliban .
however , the pot is not to be emptied all at once .
for example , when us vice-president dick cheney arrived in islamabad in early march , threatening an aid cut and direct us action against islamic militants , his message was not lost .
shortly before his unmarked aircraft landed , pakistan announced the capture in quetta of mullah obaidullah , deputy to the elusive taliban chief , mullah omar .
obaidullah carried a $ 1 million reward and was the most senior taliban captured since november 2001 .
obaidullah ’ s capture – carried out reluctantly – underscores the pakistan military ’ s ambiguous relationship with the taliban .
despite more than 700 pakistani combat deaths , many in musharraf ’ s army wish to retain the taliban as quasi-@@ allies who – when the americans leave afghanistan someday – will give pakistan the “ strategic depth ” it needs against india .
thus , to the chagrin of afghanistan ’ s president , hamid karzai , quetta remains a hub of taliban opposition to his regime .
a second aspect of musharraf ’ s strategy is to create mutually beneficial relations with islamists .
this is a tricky business .
musharraf cannot permit the mullahs to become too strong .
the mullahs , on the other hand , consider musharraf an agent of the great satan , america , and thus a traitor to islam .
nevertheless , musharraf ’ s men have skillfully fractured the main islamic opposition party , muttahida majlis-e-amal ( mma ) , with bribes , blackmail , and internal dissension fomented by agent provocateurs .
as part of the trade-off , terrorist leaders who are officially under house arrest – like maulana masood azhar and hafiz saeed – remain able to open offices , address rallies , and preach jihad freely .
such appeasement carries a price .
this is clear in islamabad , where over the past two months , kalash@@ niko@@ v-@@ toting students have openly challenged the state , following a government order for the demolition of dozens of illegally built mosques and seminaries .
unnerved by the wild-eyed students , the government faltered , then surrendered .
in a dramatic reversal , musharraf ’ s minister of religious affairs , the son of former dictator general zia ul-haq , promised to rebuild damaged mosques and even symbolically laid the first stone at one construction site .
the third element of musharraf ’ s strategy is more positive : he knows that he must do some good – and also be seen doing it .
this is crucial for his image as a newly emerged world leader , promising moderate islam in an ocean of extremism .
some of musharraf ’ s achievements are significant .
relations with india have improved , the kashmir insurgency supported by pakistan has been scaled back , a women ’ s protection bill was passed in the teeth of islamic opposition , and a virulent public school curriculum that emphasized jihad and martyrdom has been toned down .
but men who live by the gun are willing to die by the gun , and musharraf is not taking chances .
he knows that the real threat to his power – and his life – comes from within his constituency , the military .
as a result , he has become obsessed with micromanaging everything from troop movements and special events to postings and promotions , all of which require his personal stamp of approval .
hardline islamists , favored previously , are now out , and soldiers charged with mutiny have received the death penalty .
although this has further deepened pro- and anti-us divisions within the army , among both commissioned and non-commissioned officers , musharraf clearly expects to remain president well beyond the october 2007 elections , as well as to extend further his term of leadership of the army .
to achieve this end , whatever needs to be done will be done ; principles and rules are elastic .
one might have expected the americans to know better than to bet all on a man who might be gone tomorrow .
with the defeat of al-qaeda and the taliban america ’ s only visible goal , it is no surprise that the us remains enormously unpopular among pakistanis , forcing musharraf to maintain his perilous balancing act .

why a sino-american cold war won ’ t happen
oxford – it is often said that the us and china – superpowers at economic , geopolitical , and ideological loggerheads – are heading toward a new cold war .
and the rhetoric – at least from one side – has come to resemble that of winston churchill ’ s 1946 “ iron curtain ” speech , one of the inaugural events of the cold war .
just this month , us vice president mike pence accused china of predatory economic practices , military aggression against the united states , and attempts to undermine us president donald trump .
but despite the media hype , a new cold war is not inevitable – or even likely .
to be sure , chinese leaders , fearing disorder and any weakening of the communist party of china ’ s legitimacy , are determined to prevent the us from forcing changes on china ’ s political and economic system .
china will continue to pursue reforms at its own pace and in its own way .
for chinese president xi jinping , a top priority is to merge the cpc with the machinery of government in order to reduce corruption and burnish the state ’ s ideological credentials .
any attempt to interfere in this process would be crossing a red line .
fortunately for xi , trump has no interest in “ democratizing ” other countries , and he doesn ’ t seem to have been swayed by the us investors , financiers , and technology titans who want his administration to press for more access to the chinese economy .
no doubt , us tariffs threaten the 18 % of chinese exports that go to the us each year .
but the trump administration has more urgent priorities than changing china ’ s system of government , notwithstanding the aggressive rhetoric of us trade representative robert lighthizer and white house national trade council director peter navarro .
trump desperately wants to bolster us manufacturing by repatriating global supply chains and blocking or curbing imports . “ make america great again ” is really about making in america again .
still , even if today ’ s us-china standoff does not evolve into a new cold war , it could weaken both countries and usher in a more multipolar world .
within china , us rhetorical broadsides , tariffs , and sanctions may be empowering xi ’ s domestic critics .
and it doesn ’ t help that china currently has limited options for retaliating .
true , it could start to sell off some of its $ 1 trillion in us dollar reserves . but that would weaken the value of the us treasuries that it continues to hold .
the us now constitutes a minority of one within the g7 , the g20 , and the united nations framework convention on climate change . after trump pulled the us out of the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) , the remaining parties moved ahead on their own .
far from setting the terms of debate on international issues , the trump administration has convinced other countries to reduce their reliance on us leadership .
widespread circumvention of the us will hasten the emergence of a new multipolar order .
for example , by withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal , trump has essentially dared the united kingdom , france , germany , china , russia , and the european union to defy us prerogatives .
for now , countries that rely on iranian oil may have no choice but to go along with the us .
like most traded goods , oil exports are paid for in dollars – largely through the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication ( swift ) in belgium – and the us has the power to shut down such transactions .
most companies and countries have concluded that doing business in iran is not worth losing access to the us market and the international dollar-@@ payments system .
but in the future , they may no longer have to make such tradeoffs .
on august 21 , germany ’ s foreign minister , heiko maas , urged europe to establish payment channels that are independent of the us .
and the following month , the eu ’ s foreign policy chief announced plans to form a “ special purpose vehicle ” to “ assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with iran . ”
meanwhile , russia has said that it is developing its own system for financial transfers , to protect itself from being shut out of the swift system in the event of harsher us sanctions .
and china has been pursuing a similar project at least since 2015 , when the people ’ s bank of china launched a system to facilitate cross-border transactions in renminbi .
none of these alternative systems have yet to match the convenience of swift and the dollar system .
but if a new system were to take hold , it could rapidly shift power away from the us .
rather than a cold war , the world may be heading toward an international system led by four powers , with the us , china , russia , and germany dominating their respective regions and seeking the upper hand in international negotiations .
such a scenario is reminiscent of the world war ii vision of us president franklin d. roosevelt , who proposed that the four victorious allies – the us , the uk , china , and the soviet union – act as “ four policemen , ” each patrolling its own sphere of influence and negotiating with the others on world peace .
today , approximations of the same four powers are once again in the lead , only now we have stronger international institutions to help keep the peace .
whether that peace lasts will depend on the willingness of the four powers to use and adapt those institutions to the emerging international system .

the us with iran in syria
princeton – the prospect of a us military strike on syria has dimmed following president barack obama ’ s embrace of an international initiative to take control of syria ’ s chemical-weapons stockpile .
the eleventh-hour u-turn on the push for military action has come against a backdrop of intensifying diplomatic pressure from the international community to avoid escalation of the violence in syria .
and that outcome is not possible without iran .
in a joint press conference with his syrian counterpart , walid al-moallem , russian foreign minister sergey lavrov tabled a proposal , originally agreed with iran , calling for syria to “ place chemical weapons storage sites under international control . ” the stockpiles would then be destroyed and syria would fully join the international chemical weapons convention .
the second component of the russian-iranian proposal calls for international efforts , under the auspices of the united nations security council , to rein in syrian rebel forces ’ chemical-weapons capabilities .
moallem immediately embraced the proposal .
hours later , un secretary-general ban ki-moon did as well , while obama said that “ i fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way . ”
this initiative would allow obama to escape from a messy political and foreign-policy predicament .
but the matter is far from settled : obama has not ruled out a military strike .
so here are 12 reasons why america should grasp the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution afforded by the russian-iranian plan .
first , there is evidence that the syrian opposition has amassed chemical weapons .
in december 2012 , iran officially informed the us about chemical weapons , including sarin gas , being transferred to syria .
the us declined to cooperate with iran to press ahead on the case .
second , us military strikes on syria have the potential to engulf the entire region – and perhaps the us – in a broader war .
after its experiences in afghanistan and iraq over the past decade , the us can hardly afford a syrian quagmire .
third , with the regional sunni-shia conflict intensifying , the prospect of tens of billions of petrodollars backing terrorist extremists has already destabilized the region .
us military strikes against syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atrocities by the rebels against syrians of all faiths .
reports point to the execution and mutilation of syrian-@@ government prisoners .
there is no doubt that the fate of syria ’ s christian and jewish communities is now extremely precarious .
fourth , america ’ s decision to back extremists in syria contradicts its “ war on terrorism ” and will erode international support for it .
the prospect of iranian cooperation to root out al qaeda extremists , which it provided in afghanistan and iraq , would be unlikely following any intervention .
fifth , it is wrong to assume that without syrian president bashar al-assad , iran would lose its influence in the muslim world as well as its link to hezbollah in lebanon .
america ’ s regional position weakened , and iran ’ s strengthened , following the us-led invasions of afghanistan and iraq ; us intervention in syria could reproduce that pattern .
sixth , a us attack on syria would leave the us isolated internationally and end any hope of a diplomatic resolution .
there is no domestic or international appetite for another us military adventure – nato , the g-20 , the europeans , russia , china , and 60 % of americans oppose a unilateral us military strike .
seventh , the civilian casualties arising from a military strike would be high .
if the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of syrian civilians – us military intervention would do more harm than good .
eighth , us involvement in syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the us and iran .
al qaeda affiliates will target us regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on iran and its militant proxies – providing a pretext for us military confrontation .
ninth , a us military strike against a third muslim-majority country would demolish the credibility of obama ’ s efforts to repair america ’ s image in the islamic world .
indeed , it would most likely prove to be a strategic boon to the “ resistance axis ” – iran and hezbollah .
tenth , any us unilateral military strike against syria would ratchet up tensions between the us and russia .
this , in turn , would strengthen the russia-@@ iran alliance .
eleventh , iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has issued permission for president hassan rouhani ’ s new administration to enter into direct talks with the us .
no better opportunity to end decades of bilateral hostility is likely to come along .
in these circumstances , a us attack on syria would almost certainly dash any hope of a us-iran rapprochement for years to come .
finally , with the moderate rouhani now installed as president , a us military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for america and iran to reach a face-saving solution ( for both sides ) on iran ’ s nuclear program .
both iran and the us consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime .
indeed , iran was a major victim of chemical-weapons attacks during its 1980-1988 war with saddam hussein ’ s iraq .
iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of wmds in syria , the middle east , and beyond .
iran maintains that the security council is the only body legally authorized to verify allegations concerning the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response .
one promising avenue for us-iran cooperation on syria could be joint support for a fact-finding mission by the security council to identify the perpetrators .
obama has his “ red line ” on the use of chemical weapons .
so does khamenei .

why overseas chinese dominate china &apos;s exports
since the early 1990s , more foreign direct investment ( fdi ) has flowed into china than to any country except america .
of this vast capital inflow , overseas chinese – from hong kong , taiwan , macao and southeast asia – delivered the lion ’ s share .
investments from hong kong and macao claimed 70 % of chinese fdi in the early 90s ; since then their share has decreased , yet it still accounts for 50 % of china ’ s total fdi .
that china receives so much capital from expatriates is a global source of envy .
indian officials bemoan the fact that overseas indians lack both the wealth and the propensity to invest back home .
economists and china-@@ watchers celebrate this ready supply of capital , know-how , and marketing channels which enabled china to become – in a short period of time – asia ’ s manufacturing base and export power-@@ house .
lavish praise for this stream of expatriate fdi , however , misses its deep flaws .
yes , expatriate-@@ invested firms produce many chinese exports , but they often do it by seizing control of export-oriented businesses from indigenous chinese .
two ratios tell the story .
one is the export / gdp ratio , which rose from 15 % in 1990 to 20 % in 1999 , an increase of 5 % .
the other is the share of exports by foreign firms of total chinese exports : this rose from 15 % to almost 40 % during the same period .
so , foreign firms may create exports for china , but they also divert a big slice of the export pie away from indigenous chinese entrepreneurs .
expatriate control of so much export-oriented businesses reflects a fundamental failing in china ’ s financial system .
china may have the second highest savings rate in the world , lagging behind only singapore , but these funds are usually wasted on inefficient state-owned enterprises ( soes ) .
these investments have failed to increase the competitiveness of chinese soes , yet have starved efficient local entrepreneurs of the credits they need .
as a result , expatriate chinese investors buy up businesses controlled by indigenous entrepreneurs on the cheap because the money they bring is the only source of funds available for business expansion .
china ’ s ability to attract so much export-oriented fdi is thus a warning that there is something very wrong with the financial system .
discrimination against indigenous private entrepreneurs in china goes beyond finance .
until recently , private chinese firms could not export directly to foreign buyers and could not retain foreign exchange earnings .
but if you are in the export business , you need foreign exchange to import designs or intermediate inputs .
the restriction of access to foreign exchange made it impossible for private entrepreneurs to run independent export businesses .
chinese law also discriminated against local export businesses .
foreign investors often complain that their property rights go unprotected .
true , perhaps , but private chinese entrepreneurs get a far worse deal .
as early as 1982 , china ’ s constitution contained a clause to protect property rights of foreign investors ; domestic private entrepreneurs were not offered the same protection until 1999 !
supposedly , the match between china ’ s cheap labor costs and the entrepreneurship of expatriate chinese investors is made in heaven .
the problem with this view is that it implies that indigenous chinese entrepreneurs are somehow incompetent .
what matters about fdi is not only that foreign money comes into china , but also that it brings foreign control of business .
and foreign control only makes sense if it brings in the management know-how that local entrepreneurs lack .
is this a plausible explanation as to why chinese entrepreneurs cede control to expatriates ?
a look at other countries may be instructive .
native indian and turkish entrepreneurs run successful export garment businesses in their countries and contract with foreign buyers to sell goods .
the foreign buyers provide designs and even raw materials , while domestic entrepreneurs put them together according to required specifications .
unless chinese entrepreneurs are more incompetent than their indian and turkish counterparts - and no one suggests that – there is no reason why expatriate chinese cannot contract with indigenous entrepreneurs to produce goods for export .
the difference is that fdi brings not only a business opportunity but also financing to liquidity-starved chinese entrepreneurs , whereas a contract only brings forth a business opportunity .
china ’ s entrepreneurs lack money , not talent .
in fact , in some areas , chinese entrepreneurs should know more than expatriates . take traditional handicrafts like jade and ivory carving .
in 1995 , there were some 900 foreign-controlled firms producing traditional chinese handicrafts ; the average foreign equity share was 88 % .
thus , in industries in which chinese have excelled for thousands of years , foreign control is now almost absolute .
cheap labor is the least plausible argument why so much export-oriented fdi has gone to china .
fdi is not the only form of cross-border economic transaction .
a hong kong firm can contract out its production in guangdong province to reap the same labor-@@ savings benefits it would gain from investing in china .
cheap labor explains why expatriate chinese seek to produce in china ; it does not explain why their investments are so sought after by the chinese .
as china nears membership in the wto , its political and administrative apparatus is mobilizing to improve the investment environment and property rights for foreign investors .
but why not look after the interests of domestic entrepreneurs as well ?
the most urgent task for china ’ s government is not wto membership , but improving the political , regulatory and financial treatment of chinese entrepreneurs , who are as talented , innovative and hard working as their expatriate counterparts .
there is no compelling reason why they should lose control of their businesses – often at fire-sale prices – to overseas cousins on so massive a scale .

why pay more for fairness ?
marks &amp; spencer , a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout britain , recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea , totaling 38 lines , to fairtrade , a marketing symbol of “ ethical production . ”
the chain already sells only fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 café revive coffee shops .
it is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with fairtrade cotton .
the announcement came during “ fairtrade fortnight , ” a two-week promotion of fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries , telling britons how fairtrade has assisted their communities .
the movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the united states as well , as consumers increasingly turn to organic , locally produced foods , and eggs from hens not kept in cages .
in the uk , a survey has found that half of those shown the fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for third world farmers .
there is no comparable us research , but related data , and discussions with my own students , suggests that the figure would be much lower .
traders seeking fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage .
for example , the minimum price for coffee is $ 1.26 per pound , no matter how low the market price may fall .
if the market price rises above that figure , the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher .
small farmers , for their part , are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation .
plantations and factories can use the fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages , comply with health , safety , and environmental standards , allow unions or other forms of workers ’ associations , provide good housing if workers are not living at home , and do not use child labor or forced labor .
not every one approves of fairtrade .
brink lindsey , director of the pro-market cato institute ’ s center for trade policy studies , believes that the campaign for fairtrade coffee is a “ well-meaning dead end . ”
with some justification , he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals , but big increases in coffee production in brazil and vietnam , combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply .
in lindsey ’ s view , if we want to assist coffee growers , we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations ’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled – or to move into higher-value products , like specialty coffe@@ es , that bring higher prices .
what is curious about lindsey ’ s argument , however , is that the fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends – encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price .
pro-market economists don ’ t object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products .
if people want to pay $ 48 for a pound of jamaican blue mountain coffee because that ’ s what james bond prefers , economists don ’ t object that the market is being distorted .
so why be critical when consumers choose to pay $ 12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals , under shade trees that help birds to survive , by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children ?
economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children , you can pay $ 10 for a pound of non-@@ fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $ 2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children .
that ’ s a possible strategy , but there are advantages to fairtrade .
the growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like , both for its taste and for the way it is grown .
if their product sells well , they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world .
from the growers ’ perspective , receiving a premium by selling a fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce .
paying more for a fairtrade label is no more “ anti-market ” than paying more for a gucci label , and it reflects better ethical priorities .
fairtrade is not a government subsidy .
its success depends on market demand , not political lobbying .
fortunately , in europe , that market demand is growing rapidly .
one hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world , and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending .

the populist war against intelligence
atlanta – despite his seemingly limitless capacity for vindictiveness , it would be a mistake to interpret us president donald trump ’ s decision to withdraw the security clearance of former cia director john brennan as only his latest vendetta for lèse-majesté .
true , brennan has all but labeled trump and his behavior , including his russian connections , a national security threat .
but trump ’ s move is more than personal payback .
as the most recent blow in his two-@@ year-long attack on the intelligence community , his slap at brennan is a harbinger of more to come as he tries to bring his espionage agencies to heel .
more ominously for the health of the democracies of the west , other populists are following trump ’ s example .
in europe , a variety of right-wing parties , having now found themselves in power , are taking on former government antagonists , who have monitored and policed their extremism for decades .
in austria , the country ’ s populist leaders have been intimidating , mu@@ zzling , and purging the country ’ s intelligence services .
in february , on orders from the populist interior minister , austrian police raided the country ’ s main intelligence agency – the very organization charged with monitoring right-wing extremism .
( it should be recalled that the freedom party , the coalition partner in austrian chancellor sebastian kurz ’ s government , was founded by ex-@@ ss officers ) .
and what was the pretext for the raid and subsequent demotion of senior austrian intelligence officials ?
that the agency was running an operation aimed at harming north korea .
no doubt , trump wishes that he could pull off such a stunt , and both halt the investigation of him led by robert mueller and bring to heel all of the us intelligence agencies .
a fan of strongman leaders who “ get it done , ” trump admires diktats and brazen contempt for legal processes .
he almost certainly will pay even closer attention as the intelligence-@@ fueled investigations into his presidential campaign ’ s possible collusion with moscow in 2016 close in on him .
it is this combination of self-interest and contempt for law that makes trump ’ s revocation of the brennan ’ s security clearance so troubling .
the regulations governing clearances are straightforward : the president has the power to deny access to official secrets if someone is found to have compromised classified information or is at risk of doing so .
by all accounts , brennan has done nothing of the sort .
in fact , trump admits that .
buried in the explanatory word salad that accompanied the revocation of brennan ’ s security clearance , the white house claimed that brennan ’ s “ erratic ” behavior was the cause .
that accusation would be laughable if it wasn ’ t so serious .
trump has simply ignored the laws – including laws governing the us intelligence services – that he swore faithfully to execute .
eleven former cia directors and deputy directors , as well as 70 former senior cia officers ( including me ) , said as much last week , criticizing the unprecedented revocation as political coercion and accusing trump of misusing presidential powers , damaging national security , and threatening current and former officials ’ right of free speech .
as if to underscore the point , white house spokespeople say that trump intends to order more re@@ voc@@ ations , including a former national security adviser and deputy attorney general , as well as former directors of national intelligence , the cia and the national security agency .
the hit list is no coincidence .
those in the crosshairs have overseen intelligence collection and analysis that informed the intelligence community ’ s conclusion that russia interfered in the 2016 election , including possible collusion with trump ’ s presidential campaign .
with attacks on the intelligence and law enforcement communities playing well among his supporters , trump could well double down on this demagoguery .
but his willingness to use his presidential powers as a blatantly partisan political weapon breaks ground that no american should want him to tread .
the damage that has resulted from the raid in austria shows why .
while austrian courts ultimately will determine the raid ’ s legality , the effects are already clear .
by stripping austria ’ s spies of their files , the raid has essentially put the intelligence service out of operation and raised doubts among allied intelligence services about the austrians ’ reliability .
internal operations are dead in the water , as is intelligence sharing with european counterparts .
washington is not vienna , but the parallels deserve close attention nonetheless .
trump ’ s attacks on the intelligence community and its former leaders are unprecedented , and it would be naive not to consider their impact , not only on the current intelligence leadership but also on the rank-and-file officers that do the difficult and often dangerous work of intelligence gathering and analysis .
that is why it is so important to adhere to the laws that empower ( and constrain ) intelligence agencies and that underpin the political independence and integrity of their officers .
events in austria should be a warning .
for democracies to thrive , government must be transparent as well as publicly accountable .
when it comes to overseeing intelligence agencies pledged to protect their sources and methods , the challenges are obvious .
but so , too , are the threats , including to the democratic process itself , when politicians violate rather than respect the rules that govern their intelligence services ’ integrity .
in the final analysis , brennan isn ’ t the only victim of trump ’ s unwarranted and vindictive action .
so are all americans when national leaders put their own interests above those of the country and corrupt the political system they are sworn to defend .

why put charles taylor on trial
we petitioned nigeria &apos;s federal high court last may to review the decision of nigerian president olusegun obasanjo to grant refugee status to former liberian president charles taylor , who is a fugitive from war crimes charges brought by a united nations-backed special court in sierra leone .
we are two of taylor &apos;s many victims .
seven years ago , we were young nigerian businessmen trading in electronic hardware and medical equipment on africa &apos;s west coast .
we procured our supplies in nigeria and exported them to liberia and sierra leone .
in the summer of 1997 , david was in monrovia when charles taylor was inaugurated president of liberia following an eight-year civil war .
one year later , the un and the economic community of west african states deployed soldiers as peacekeepers in neighboring sierra leone to guarantee a ceasefire in that country &apos;s near-@@ decade-long conflict , instigated by rebels of the revolutionary united front .
in the fall of 1998 , we traveled separately on business trips to freetown , the capital of sierra leone .
on previous visits , we had heard reports of atrocities committed by ruf rebels , including amputations , rapes , and mutilations of civilians in the countryside .
but the presence of the international community reassured us that it was safe to do business in the country .
both our home government and friends in sierra leone agreed .
we planned to spend the christmas and new year holidays in freetown before returning to nigeria early in 1999 .
then our plans went awry .
shortly before christmas , rumors of an impending rebel assault began to filter into sierra leone &apos;s capital .
first a trickle , then a deluge of internally displaced persons arrived .
we tried to change our flights and return to nigeria , but there were no flights available .
on january 6 , the rebels overran the home where we were staying in freetown .
we were among nine nigerians staying there .
the rebels - over one hundred of them , many young teenagers - surrounded our building , set it on fire , and ordered all nigerians to come out .
their commander , who spoke with a distinct liberian accent , called himself captain goldteeth .
when we tried to escape , the rebels captured us .
captain goldteeth had us brought to a bus terminal next to our residence , where more than 80 other captives were assembled .
he said that he had instructions - from the executive mansion in monrovia - to send a message to nigeria , the leading troop contributor and financier of the regional peacekeeping force , ecomog .
captain goldteeth asked the &quot; cut-@@ hand-@@ cut-@@ foot man &quot; to separate nigerians from the others .
then they began to amput@@ ate us .
their first victim was emmanuel &apos;s younger brother , benedict egbuna .
they cut off his hands from beneath the elbow .
he bled to death in front of his pregnant wife , zainab , and us before he was dumped behind the house .
many of our best friends were also mutilated and killed .
next it was our turn .
the machete cut through emmanuel &apos;s flesh and bones but did not entirely sever them .
with hands dangling from his arms , the rebels dumped emmanuel in the cemetery .
they then cut off david &apos;s arms before setting him ablaze .
neither of us knows how we survived this ordeal .
benedict egbuna &apos;s five-year old son , benedict jr . , born five months after the slaughter of his father , is a source of comfort to both of us and to all who knew his father .
someday , when he grows up , benedict jr. will look to us to reconstruct the memories of the father he will never know .
at a later point , benedict will almost certainly also ask us what happened to those responsible for his father &apos;s killing .
what shall we tell him ?
we have a duty to seek justice for the victims of charles taylor &apos;s crimes .
refugee status is a humanitarian shelter .
nigeria must not let it be used as a tyrant &apos;s shield .

why putin makes a bad ally
stanford – russian president vladimir putin ’ s intervention in the syrian conflict has been welcomed by some as a moment for the kremlin to “ come in from the cold . ”
russia ’ s conflict with the islamic state , the argument goes , has aligned the country ’ s interests with those of the west .
even turkey ’ s downing of a russian warplane does not seem not to have deflated this optimism .
indeed , at a recent press conference , us president barack obama again urged putin to join the alliance against the islamic state .
and french president françois hollande billed his recent visit to moscow as an effort to build a broad international coalition against the terrorist group .
at first blush , the idea that russia is a natural ally against islamist terrorists seems to make sense .
the country has suffered horrific terrorist attacks by islamist extremists , including the bombing in november of a plane above the sinai peninsula , which killed 224 passengers and crew , nearly all of them russian .
around 20 million muslims , most of them sunni , live within the russian federation , and the country ’ s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former soviet republics and russia have joined the islamic state .
on deeper examination , however , it becomes clear that an anti-terror alliance with russia is wishful thinking .
putin has not gone into syria to defeat the islamic state . he has intervened to save the regime of russia ’ s client , syrian president bashar al-assad .
putin may sometimes give the appearance that he is ready to abandon assad , but ultimately he will defend him .
leaving assad to his fate would be a sign of weakness – and thus anathema to putin .
ordinary russians may be in danger of attacks by islamic extremists , but they pose little threat to putin or his allies .
russia has indeed suffered a number of terrorist attacks , including the 2004 beslan massacre , in which 334 people , most of them schoolchildren , were killed .
in nearly every case , the response to the attacks was brutal , inept , and costly in terms of civilian lives lost .
and yet the putin regime has emerged unscathed each time .
indeed , terrorist attacks at the turn of the century solidified public opinion against chechen rebels and gave putin the public support he needed to raze grozny , chechnya ’ s capital .
putin ’ s confidence in dealing with terrorism reflects the design of russia ’ s security state .
russia spends more on internal security than it does on national defense .
it has interior ministry troops , federal security agency ( fsb ) special forces , omon ( mobile special service ) troops , military intelligence troops , and a vast network of internal spies and informants .
regime opponents are not allowed to run for office , their rights to demonstrate are restricted , and they are subject to a legal arbitrariness in the courts .
citizens have virtually no protection from wiretaps or the interception of their electronic communications .
every society must balance civil rights against national security .
putin ’ s russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum , while the united states and europe ( despite the protests of civil libertarians ) have chosen to occupy the other end .
indeed , russia is an example of the upper limit of what state power can do to control terrorist activity .
it would be a rare extremist group that had not been infiltrated with an informant who reports to moscow .
there is even evidence that those who carried out the beslan massacre were infiltrated by russian intelligence .
moreover , any terrorist group knows that their operations will be met with the most extreme use of force .
in beslan , for example , russian special forces used thermo@@ bari@@ c weapons .
as the reaction to the attacks in paris illustrates , the seemingly random murder of 130 civilians has monumental resonance in the west – especially when the religious and ideological motives are difficult to understand .
but the kremlin places a lower value on human lives than western societies do .
in putin ’ s calculations , the loss of lives in extremist attacks is unwelcome , but ultimately acceptable if it does not threaten the regime .
the russian people might be horrified and frightened . but the russian regime is primarily concerned with its own survival – and with how it might use the public ’ s horror to its benefit .
working with the west to combat the islamic state serves neither of those purposes .

new york – the united states federal reserve ’ s decision to undertake a third round of quantitative easing , or qe3 , has raised three important questions .
will qe3 jump-start america ’ s anemic economic growth ?
will it lead to a persistent increase in risky assets , especially in us and other global equity markets ?
finally , will its effects on gdp growth and equity markets be similar or different ?
many now argue that qe3 ’ s effect on risky assets should be as powerful , if not more so , than that of qe1 , qe2 , and “ operation twist , ” the fed ’ s earlier bond-purchase program .
after all , while the previous rounds of us monetary easing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices , the size and duration of qe3 are more substantial .
but , despite the fed ’ s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing , its effects on the real economy and on us equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous qe rounds .
consider , first , that the previous qe rounds came at times of much lower equity valuations and earnings .
in march 2009 , the s &amp; p 500 index was down to 660 , earnings per share ( eps ) of us companies and banks had sunk to a financial-crisis low , and price / earnings ratios were in the single digits .
today , the s &amp; p 500 is more than 100 % higher ( hovering near 1,@@ 430 ) , the average eps is close to $ 100 , and p / e ratios are above 14 .
even during qe2 , in the summer of 2010 , the s &amp; p 500 , p / e ratios , and eps were much lower than they are today .
if , as is likely , economic growth in the us remains anemic in spite of qe3 , top-line revenues and bottom-line earnings will turn south , with negative effects on equity valuations .
moreover , fiscal support is absent this time : qe1 and qe2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip , respectively , because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus .
in contrast , qe3 will be associated with a fiscal contraction , possibly even a large fiscal cliff .
even if the us avoids the full fiscal cliff of 4.5 % of gdp that is looming at the end of the year , it is highly likely that a fiscal drag amounting to 1.5 % of gdp will hit the economy in 2013 .
with the us economy currently growing at a 1.6 % annual rate , a fiscal drag of even 1 % implies near-stagnation in 2013 , though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing , together with qe3 , should keep us growth at about its current level in 2013 .
but there is no broader rebound underway .
in both 2010 and 2011 , leading economic indicators showed that the first-half slowdown had bottomed out , and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of monetary easing .
thus , qe nudged along an economy that was already recovering , which prolonged asset reflation .
by contrast , the latest data suggest that the us economy is performing as sluggishly now as it was in the first half of the year .
indeed , if anything , weakness in the us labor market , low capital expenditures , and slow income growth have contradicted signals in the early summer that third-quarter growth might be more robust .
meanwhile , the main transmission channels of monetary stimulus to the real economy – the bond , credit , currency , and stock markets – remain weak , if not broken .
indeed , the bond-market channel is unlikely to boost growth .
long-term government bond yields are already very low , and a further reduction will not significantly change private agents ’ borrowing costs .
the credit channel also is not working properly , as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from qe , creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending .
those who can borrow have ample cash and are cautious about spending , while those who want to borrow – highly indebted households and firms ( especially small and medium-size enterprises ) – face a credit crunch .
the currency channel is similarly impaired .
with global growth weakening , net exports are unlikely to improve robustly , even with a weaker dollar .
moreover , many major central banks are implementing variants of qe alongside the fed , dampening the effect of the fed ’ s actions on the dollar ’ s value .
perhaps most important , a weaker dollar ’ s effect on the trade balance , and thus on growth , is limited by two factors .
first , a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities , which implies a drag on the trade balance , because the us is a net commodity-importing country .
second , any improvement in gdp derived from stronger exports leads to an increase in imports .
empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker us dollar on the trade balance is close to zero .
the only other significant channel to transmit qe to the real economy is the wealth effect of an equity-market increase , but there is some circularity in the argument that qe3 will lead to a persistent rise in equity prices .
if persistent asset reflation requires a significant gdp growth recovery , it is taut@@ ological to say that if equity prices rise enough following qe , the resulting increase in gdp from a wealth effect justifies the rise in asset prices .
if monetary policy ’ s transmission channels to the real economy are broken , one cannot assume that qe will have a significant effect on economic growth .
fed chairman ben bernanke has recently emphasized the importance of an additional channel : the confidence channel , through which the fed ’ s commitment to maintaining generous monetary conditions for longer could improve private spending .
the issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be .
confidence is fragile in an environment characterized by ongoing deleveraging , macro uncertainties , weak labor-market growth , and a fiscal drag .
in short , qe3 reduces the tail risk of an outright economic contraction , but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful deleveraging process .
in the short run , qe3 will lead investors to take on risk , and will stimulate modest asset reflation .
but the equity-price rise is likely to fizzle out over time if economic growth disappoints , as is likely , and drags down expectations about corporate revenues and profitability .

shinzo abe ’ s monetary-policy delusions
new haven – the politicization of central banking continues unabated .
the resurrection of shinzo abe and japan ’ s liberal democratic party – pillars of the political system that has left the japanese economy mired in two lost decades and counting – is just the latest case in point .
japan ’ s recent election hinged critically on abe ’ s views of the bank of japan ’ s monetary policy stance .
he argued that a timid boj should learn from its more aggressive counterparts , the us federal reserve and the european central bank .
just as the fed and the ecb have apparently saved the day through their unconventional and aggressive quantitative easing ( qe ) , goes the argument , abe believes it is now time for the boj to do the same .
it certainly looks as if he will get his way .
with boj governor masaaki shirakawa ’ s term ending in april , abe will be able to select a successor – and two deputy governors as well – to do his bidding .
but will it work ?
while experimental monetary policy is now widely accepted as standard operating procedure in today ’ s post-crisis era , its efficacy is dubious .
nearly four years after the world hit bottom in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , qe ’ s impact has been strikingly asymmetric .
while massive liquidity injections were effective in unfreezing credit markets and arrested the worst of the crisis – witness the role of the fed ’ s first round of qe in 2009-2010 – subsequent efforts have not sparked anything close to a normal cyclical recovery .
the reason is not hard to fathom .
hobbled by severe damage to private and public-sector balance sheets , and with policy interest rates at or near zero , post-bubble economies have been mired in a classic “ liquidity trap . ”
they are more focused on paying down massive debt overhangs built up before the crisis than on assuming new debt and boosting aggregate demand .
the sad case of the american consumer is a classic example of how this plays out .
in the years leading up to the crisis , two bubbles – property and credit – fueled a record-high personal-consumption binge .
when the bubbles burst , households understandably became fixated on balance-sheet repair – namely , paying down debt and rebuilding personal savings , rather than resuming excessive spending habits .
indeed , notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of fed assets to roughly $ 3 trillion – probably on their way to $ 4 trillion over the next year – us consumers have pulled back as never before .
in the 19 quarters since the start of 2008 , annualized growth of inflation-adjusted consumer spending has averaged just 0.7 % – almost three percentage points below the 3.6 % trend increases recorded in the 11 years ending in 2006 .
nor does the ecb have reason to be gra@@ tified with its strain of quantitative easing .
despite a doubling of its balance sheet , to a little more than € 3 trillion ( $ 4 trillion ) , europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years .
not only is qe ’ s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn , balance-sheet-constrained economies limited ; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy .
central banks that buy sovereign debt issued by fiscal authorities offset market-@@ imposed discipline on borrowing costs , effectively subsidizing public-sector profligacy .
unfortunately , it appears that japan has forgotten many of its own lessons – especially the boj ’ s disappointing experience with zero interest rates and qe in the early 2000 ’ s .
but it has also lost sight of the 1990 ’ s – the first of its so-called lost decades – when the authorities did all they could to prolong the life of insolvent banks and many nonfinancial corporations .
zombie-like companies were kept on artificial life-support in the false hope that time alone would revive them .
it was not until late in the decade , when the banking sector was reorganized and corporate restructuring was encouraged , that japan made progress on the long , arduous road of balance-sheet repair and structural transformation .
us authorities have succumbed to the same japanese-like temptations .
from quantitative easing to record-high federal budget deficits to unprecedented bailouts , they have done everything in their power to mask the pain of balance-sheet repair and structural adjustment .
as a result , america has created its own generation of zombies – in this case , zombie consumers .
like japan , america ’ s post-bubble healing has been limited – even in the face of the fed ’ s outsize liquidity injections .
household debt stood at 112 % of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record highs in 2006 , but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75 % norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century .
similarly , the personal-@@ saving rate , at just 3.5 % in the four months ending in november 2012 , was less than half the 7.9 % average of 1970-@@ 99 .
the same is true of europe .
the ecb ’ s über-@@ aggressive actions have achieved little in the way of bringing about long-awaited structural transformation in the region .
crisis-torn peripheral european economies still suffer from unsustainable debt loads and serious productivity and competitiveness problems .
and a fragmented european banking system remains one of the weakest links in the regional daisy chain .
is this the “ cure ” that abe really wants for japan ?
the last thing that the japanese economy needs at this point is backsliding on structural reforms .
yet , by forcing the boj to follow in the misdirected footsteps of the fed and the ecb , that is precisely the risk that abe and japan are facing .
massive liquidity injections carried out by the world ’ s major central banks – the fed , the ecb , and the boj – are neither achieving traction in their respective real economies , nor facilitating balance-sheet repair and structural change .
that leaves a huge sum of excess liquidity sloshing around in global asset markets .
where it goes , the next crisis is inevitably doomed to follow .

why remember pearl harbor ?
new york – december 7 marks the 67th anniversary of the japanese attack on pearl harbor .
over the years , “ the day of infamy ” has become a classic reference point for galvanizing patriotic sentiment in america .
in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attack , for example , analogies to pearl harbor were made frequently .
but despite its central place in america ’ s collective memory , pearl harbor remains little understood .
why did japan initiate such a seemingly self-destructive war in the first place ?
aside from lessons that japan must learn from its momentous decision , is there something to be learned by the united states as well ?
the decision to attack pearl harbor was reached after five months of deliberations that included numerous official conferences .
it was a gradual process in which more sympathetic , albeit firm , us engagement might have helped sway japan in a different direction .
in fact , japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end .
many in the japanese army initially regarded the soviet union as the main threat facing the country .
others saw the us as the primary enemy .
some were concerned with more abstract , ideological enemies , such as communism and “ americanism , ” while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the “ white race ” ( including japan ’ s allies , germany and italy ) against the “ yellow race . ”
then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all , particularly the us , whose long-term war-making power , the government knew , far surpassed japan ’ s own .
the tactical mastermind of the pearl harbor operation , admiral isoroku yamamoto , was one of them .
over the course of the summer of 1941 , events slowly tilted japan towards the possibility of war with the west .
but pearl harbor was in no way inevitable .
germany ’ s attack on the soviet union compelled japan in july 1941 to prepare a plan of attack .
although it made clear japan ’ s desire to take advantage of the european conflict and gain a foothold in the european colonies in southeast asia , the plan was not clear about who constituted japan ’ s true enemy .
japan ’ s military thrust into southeast asia led president franklin delano roosevelt ’ s administration to impose sanctions .
the us froze japanese assets , an example followed by britain and the dutch east indies .
when japan responded by taking over southern french indochina , the us retaliated by imposing an embargo on oil exports to japan .
rather than telling japan that the us was determined to search for a diplomatic solution , america ’ s categorical reaction confirmed it to the japanese as an arrogant and conceited enemy .
moreover , by transferring its pacific fleet from san diego to pearl harbor , the us encouraged the japanese understanding that the us fully anticipated war with japan .
world war ii in the pacific finally came about for many different reasons .
but it was , above all , the sense of encirclement and humiliation that united the deeply divided japanese government .
feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the us , including an overture to hold direct talks with roosevelt , prime minister fumimaro konoe resigned on october 16 , making hard-line army minister hideki tōjō his successor .
the high-handed tone of the hull note of november 26 , demanding japan ’ s withdrawal of all its troops from china , was a final blow to the moderates in japan ’ s government , who still hoped for diplomatic negotiations .
by this time , many policymakers were convinced that the us was not ready to hear them out .
it was ultimately in the name of saving asia for all asians from what was regarded as western arrogance that the government united to wage war .
on december 1 , it was decided that the war would commence in six days .
there were legitimate historical reasons for japan to feel humiliated on the eve of war .
the gunboat diplomacy that resulted in the opening of japan and unequal treaties in the mid-19th century was but a beginning .
more immediately , the great depression and the subsequent compartmentalization of the world into economic blocs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful .
coupled with the economic hardship of the interwar years were instances of racial prejudice in the us that aimed at preventing japanese immigration .
united by this long-simmering and humiliating sense of exclusion , japanese policymakers , whatever their differences , stumbled toward the december 1 decision to go to war .
with almost 70 years of hindsight , pearl harbor should offer some lessons for us foreign policy today .
despite obvious differences between pearl harbor and recent islamist terrorist tactics , they show the common desire of self-proclaimed davids to topple their goliaths in a clearly lo@@ p-@@ sided battle .
these davids depend on western technologies to overcome imbalances of power , and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humiliation .
but no matter how strong and historically justified such grievances may be those who resort to murderous tactics must be condemned .
however , high-@@ handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response , for this approach further humili@@ ates those who already feel humiliated , and alienates those who might otherwise pro@@ ffer a more moderate voice .
diplomacy no longer works with terrorism , but it can help to prevent it by dealing carefully with potentially hostile states .
with global expectations mounting for a fresh start in us foreign policy , it is vital not just to remember , but to understand the attack on pearl harbor .

new york – most people around the world will not be able to vote in the united states ’ s upcoming presidential election , even though they have a great deal at stake in the result .
overwhelmingly , non-us citizens favor barack obama ’ s re-election over a victory for his challenger , mitt romney .
there are good reasons for this .
in terms of the economy , the effects of romney ’ s policies in creating a more unequal and divided society would not be directly felt abroad .
but , in the past , for better and for worse , others have often followed america ’ s example .
many governments quickly subscribed to ronald reagan ’ s mantra of deregulated markets – policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 1930 ’ s .
other countries that followed america ’ s lead have experienced growing inequality – more money at the top , more poverty at the bottom , and a weaker middle class .
romney ’ s proposed contractionary policies – the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely , while the us economy is still frail – will almost surely weaken america ’ s already anemic growth , and , if the euro crisis worsens , it could bring on another recession .
at that point , with us demand shrinking , the rest of the world would indeed feel the economic effects of a romney presidency quite directly .
that raises the question of globalization , which entails concerted action on many fronts by the international community .
but what is required with regard to trade , finance , climate change , and a host other areas is not being done .
many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of american leadership .
but , while romney may summon bravado and strong rhetoric , other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him , owing to the belief ( correct in my judgment ) that he would take the us – and them – in the wrong direction .
american “ exceptionalism ” may sell well at home , but it does poorly abroad .
president george w. bush ’ s iraq war – arguably a violation of international law – showed that though america spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined , it could not pacify a country with less than 10 % of its population and less than 1 % of its gdp .
moreover , it turned out that us-style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable .
with most americans ’ incomes stagnating for a decade and a half , it was clear that the us economic model was not delivering for most citizens , whatever official gdp data said .
indeed , the model blew up even before bush left office .
together with the abuses of human rights under his administration , the great recession – the predictable ( and predicted ) consequence of his economic policies – did as much to weaken america ’ s soft power as the wars in iraq and afghanistan did to weaken the credibility of its military power .
in terms of values – namely , the values of romney and his running mate , paul ryan – things are not much better .
for example , every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care , and obama ’ s affordable care act represents a significant step toward that goal .
but romney has criticized this effort , and has offered nothing in its place .
america now has the distinction of being among the advanced countries that afford the least equality of opportunity to their citizens .
and romney ’ s drastic budget cutbacks , targeted at the poor and middle class , would further impede social mobility .
at the same time , he would expand the military , spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist , enriching defense contractors like halliburton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education .
while bush is not on the ballot , romney has not really distanced himself from the bush administration ’ s policies .
on the contrary , his campaign has featured the same advisers , the same devotion to higher military spending , the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem , and the same fuzzy budget math .
consider , for example , the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier : climate change , financial regulation , and trade .
romney has been silent on the first , and many in his party are “ climate deniers . ”
the world cannot expect genuine leadership from romney there .
as for financial regulation , while the recent crisis has highlighted the need for stricter rules , agreement on many issues has proven to be elusive , partly because the obama administration is too close to the financial sector .
with romney , though , there would be no distance at all : metaphorically speaking , he is the financial sector .
one financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank havens , which exist mainly for purposes of tax evasion and avoidance , money laundering , and corruption .
money does not go to the cayman islands because sunshine makes it grow faster ; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine .
but , with romney unapologetic about his own use of cayman banks , we are unlikely to see progress even in this area .
on trade , romney promises to launch a trade war with china , and to declare it a currency manipulator on day one – a promise that gives him little wiggle room .
he refuses to note the renminbi ’ s large real appreciation in recent years , or to acknowledge that , while changes in china ’ s exchange rate may affect the bilateral trade deficit , what matters is america ’ s multilateral trade deficit .
a stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the us from china to lower-cost producers of textiles , apparel , and other goods .
the irony – again lost on romney – is that other countries are accusing the us of currency manipulation .
after all , one of the main benefits of the federal reserve ’ s policy of “ quantitative easing ” – perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy – derives from the depreciation of the us dollar .
the world has a lot riding on america ’ s election .
unfortunately , most people who will be affected by it – almost the entire world – will have no influence on the outcome .

why shoot down ryanair ?
competition policy is the european union &apos;s biggest success .
the reason is simple : decisions in this area have been removed from the jurisdiction of individual nations , thus making them more difficult to influence .
the result is that the many lobbies that oppose increased competition , or fight to protect state aid , have been hugely weakened .
but has the anti-trust fight gone too far ?
the executive powers that the european commission enjoys over competition policy allow it to circumvent the national vetoes and compromises that are common in other areas .
for example , implementation of rules governing the single market are subject to a unanimity rule , or at the very least a qualified majority of member states , with the result that progress is usually slow .
the european commission recently lost much of its standing in the eyes of ordinary europeans with the vitriolic fights between the council and the commission over the defunct stability pact and the failure to approve the draft constitution .
so it is vital that the commission &apos;s reputation in the area of competition policy shine because this reputation is the union &apos;s most precious capital ; this is no time to waste it .
however , excessive zeal and pursuit of cases with dubious economic justification , as has sometimes happened in merger cases , can do serious damage .
those who argue for the protection of state aid , for instance , immediately use an unfortunate decision in the merger area : see , they say , how stupid the commission is at economics !
examples of this include the decisions to veto the merger between airtours and first choice , and also between tetra laval and sidel - decisions that where based on dubious arguments and were eventually reversed by the european court of justice , with serious damage to the commission &apos;s credibility .
the recent decision to fine ryanair , europe &apos;s main budget airline , for its arrangement with local officials in using charleroi as its main airport in belgium , is another example of an unfortunate decision that could undermine the commission &apos;s reputation .
here are the facts : charleroi was a small dusty airport with less than 200,000 passengers per year .
ryanair proposed a deal : the airport for@@ goes its landing fees , and in exchange ryanair flies in two million people per year .
the deal was signed and almost everybody was happy : passengers who fly cheaply ; the airport , where the number of shops increased along with the number of passengers ; the local community , where new jobs were created .
the unhappy exceptions , of course , were the big airlines that charge ten times as much as ryanair and were losing business .
state-owned , said brussels ?
then foregoing landing fees is tantamount to giving ryanair state aid - the presumption being that the lost revenue must be coming at the expense of belgian taxpayers .
so the commission asked ryanair to pay back most of the forgone fees , and announced that it will review the airline &apos;s terms of operation at other european airports as well .
the outcome may well be the demise of ryanair .
michael o &apos;@@ leary , the ceo of ryanair , is a visionary .
in an interview last summer , he depicted a world in which people would fly free and airlines would charge airports in exchange for the millions of passengers they deliver to their shops .
this is the best possible world for passengers , since nobody forces anyone to spend money in an airport ; people do it only because it is convenient .
even leaving aside this vision , ryanair succeeded in providing cheap fares in a european travel market that not long ago was prohibitively expensive .
ryanair has been a champion of increasing competition in the airline industry , forcing other carriers to reduce fares .
punishing this airline will only reduce competition in the airline industry , an outcome that , mario monti , the eu competition commissioner , and loyola de palacio , the eu transport commissioner , cannot possibly want .
obviously , one may object that if the commission lowers its guard on state aid once , then &quot; everything may go . &quot;
so how can the commission distinguish between cases ?
our answer is that there should be a presumption that state aid to any industry or specific company must be subject to prohibition .
this simple principle should guide commission competition decisions .
only in exceptional cases can this presumption be overturned .
ryanair is probably one of these exceptional cases .
after all , there was a far better solution than punishing the airline : force belgium to privati@@ se the airport .
once private , charleroi airport could sign any agreement it wishes , with ryanair or any other airline .
here , however , we hit a soft spot : european treaties protect competition , but are neutral vis-à-vis state ownership of companies .
brussels cannot force a member country to privatize : it can only force it to run a state-owned company as if it were a private corporation .
this is difficult , because getting rid of the implicit guarantee enjoyed by a state-owned company is virtually impossible .
drafters of the next rendition of the european constitution should take notice .

long live china ’ s slowdown
new haven – at 7.7 % , china ’ s annual gdp growth in the first quarter of this year was slower than many expected .
while the data were hardly devastating relative to a consensus forecast of 8.2 % , many ( including me ) expected a second consecutive quarterly rebound from the slowdown that appeared to have ended in the third quarter of 2012 .
china doubters around the world were quick to pounce on the number , expressing fears of a stall , or even a dreaded double dip .
but slower gdp growth is actually good for china , provided that it reflects the long-awaited structural transformation of the world ’ s most dynamic economy .
the broad outlines of this transformation are well known – a shift from export- and investment-led growth to an economic structure that draws greater support from domestic private consumption .
less well known is that a rebalanced china should have a slower growth rate – the first hints of which may now be evident .
a rebalanced china can grow more slowly for one simple reason : by drawing increased support from services-led consumer demand , china ’ s new model will embrace a more labor-intensive growth recipe .
the numbers seem to bear that out .
china ’ s services sector requires about 35 % more jobs per unit of gdp than do manufacturing and construction – the primary drivers of the old model .
that number has potentially huge implications , because it means that china could grow at an annual rate in the 7-8 % range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction .
china has struggled to attain these goals with anything less than 10 % growth , because the old model was not generating enough jobs per unit of output .
as chinese manufacturing moved up the value chain , firms increasingly replaced workers with machines embodying the latest technologies .
as a result , its economic model spawned a labor-saving , capital-intensive growth dynamic .
on one level , that made sense .
but it left china in a deepening hole : increasingly deficient in jobs per unit of output , it needed more units of output to absorb its surplus labor .
the old manufacturing model , which fueled an unprecedented 20-fold increase in per capita income relative to the early 1990 ’ s , also sowed the seeds of excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation .
services-led growth is , in many ways , the antidote to the “ unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and ultimately unsustainable ” growth model that former premier wen jiabao ’ s famously criticized in 2007 .
yet services offer more than just a labor-intensive growth path .
compared to manufacturing , they have much smaller resource and carbon footprints .
a services-led model provides china with an alternative , environmentally friendlier , and ultimately more sustainable economic structure .
it is premature , of course , to conclude that a services-led transformation to slower growth is now at hand .
the latest data hint at such a possibility , with the tertiary sector ( services ) expanding at an 8.3 % annual rate in the first quarter of this year – the third consecutive quarter of acceleration and a half-@@ percentage point faster than the 7.8 % first-quarter gain recorded by the secondary sector ( manufacturing and construction ) .
but it will take more than a few quarters of mildly encouraging data to validate such an important shift in the chinese economy ’ s underlying structure .
not surprisingly , china skeptics are putting a different spin on the latest growth numbers .
fears of a shado@@ w-@@ bank-@@ induced credit bubble now top the worry list , reinforcing longstanding concerns that china may succumb to the dreaded “ middle-income trap ” – a sustained growth slowdown that has ensnared most high-growth emerging economies at the juncture that china has now reached .
china is hardly immune to such a possibility .
but it is unlikely to occur if china can carry out the services-led pro-consumption rebalancing that remains the core strategic initiative of its current ( 12th ) five-year plan .
invariably , the middle-income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early-stage development models for too long .
for china , the risk will be highest if it sticks with the timeworn recipe of unbalanced manufactur@@ ing@@ - and construction-led growth , which has created such serious sustainability problems .
if china fails to rebalance , weak external demand from a crisis-battered developed world will continue to hobble its export machine , forcing it to up the ante on a credit@@ - and investment-led growth model – in effect , doubling down on resource-intensive and environmentally damaging growth .
but i remain hopeful that china ’ s new leadership team will move quickly to implement its new model .
there are no viable alternatives .
financial markets , as well as growth-starved developed economies , are not thrilled with the natural rhythm of slower growth that a rebalanced chinese economy is likely to experience .
resource industries – indeed , resource-based economies like australia , canada , brazil , and russia – have become addicted to china ’ s old strain of unsustainable hyper-growth .
yet china knows that it is time to break that dangerous habit .
the united states is likely to have a different problem with consumer-led growth in china .
after all , higher private consumption implies an end to china ’ s surplus saving – and thus to the seemingly open-ended recycling of that surplus into dollar-based assets such as us treasury bills .
who will then fund america ’ s budget deficit – and on what terms ?
just as china must embrace slower growth as a natural consequence of its rebalancing imperative , the rest of the world will need to figure out how to cope when it does .

milan – until recently , relatively little attention was paid to states ’ balance sheets .
measurement and reporting were neglected .
even today , states ’ liabilities receive considerable attention , while their asset sides receive significantly less .
in an earlier era , states owned substantial industrial assets .
this “ commanding heights of the economy ” model was rejected largely because it seriously under-performed , especially when state-owned sectors were protected from competition ( as was the norm ) .
but , more important , the absence of entry and exit by firms , a key ingredient of innovation , caused dynamism to suffer and losses to grow over time .
the model ’ s shortcomings led to privatization in many developed and developing countries .
in europe , privatization was viewed as a key step in the integration process .
the theory , in europe and elsewhere , was that states could not be impartial owners of industrial assets .
through regulation , public procurement , and hidden subsidies , they would favor their own assets .
of course , state ownership is not the only way to impede efficiency and dynamism .
regulations in a range of countries , from japan to italy , create sectors that are sheltered from competition , with detrimental effects on productivity .
this pattern is particularly pronounced in the non-tradable sectors ( which account for two-thirds of the economy ) , where the discipline of foreign competition is absent by definition .
even here , foreign-based domestic competitors could improve performance .
it is important that more attention is now paid to public liabilities – not only growing sovereign debt , but also larger , non-debt liabilities embedded in social-insurance programs .
a combination of defective growth models , rising longevity , and unanticipated increases in costs ( such as health care in america ) have caused these longer-term liabilities to explode .
reining in debt and other liabilities has substantially reduced governments ’ scope for sustaining demand in the face of severe negative shocks , thus reducing their ability to buy time for structural adjustment in the private sector .
shifting consumption to investment via tax increases is possible , but too problematic politically , with the burden-sharing issue usually leading to impasse and inaction .
meanwhile , the asset side of states ’ balance sheets remains largely invisible .
states own land , mineral rights , and infrastructure .
some have sovereign wealth funds .
many have public pension funds of substantial magnitude , consisting of diversified portfolios of assets .
these assets are , in a sense , spoken for – there are claims on them in the form of liabilities , which have grown as expected risk-adjusted returns on assets decline ; but they do represent a partial funding of public liabilities and are an element of resilience .
by contrast , in china , the asset side of the state balance sheet is very large : land , foreign-currency reserves of $ 3.5 trillion , and around an 85 % stake in state-owned enterprises that account for about 40 % of output .
this balance-sheet configuration has helped china to respond to shocks and sustain high levels of public-sector investment .
the liability side will expand as social insurance grows – but slowly , owing to a fear of underestimating the liabilities being created .
in the best case – without a sharp decline in financial assets accelerating an economic downturn , a sudden collapse of a defective growth model , or even rapid increases in liabilities associated with demographic shifts or health-care technology – it might make sense to focus only on controlling liabilities .
but a best-case scenario provides a poor policy framework in our imperfect world .
in fact , states are routinely called upon to deal with a wide range of market failures or limitations : unsustainable growth patterns and regulatory myopia ; distributional problems associated with the evolution of technology and globalization ; accelerating concentration of national income ; and major structural transitions associated with shocks and secular trends in technology and the global economy .
here is the dilemma : governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act , but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism .
in china , where the asset side of the balance sheet is large , the strategy of shrinking it via privatization has been largely rejected , at least for now .
the loss of resilience would be too great .
that leads to the challenge of effective management of public assets – management that promotes rather than impedes market efficiency and innovation .
here , what might be called the pension / sovereign-wealth-fund model – in which a public entity holds and manages a diversified portfolio of assets as a financial investor with appropriately specified duties and governance – seems to be the right way to go .
the asset side of the balance sheet is maintained in the aggregate , but the management of the assets , particularly the diversification of holdings , can be thought of as prudent and de facto privatized .
for developed countries , increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long-term priority .
periodic systemic risk affects entire economies and public finances , not only financial markets , and governments should be able to respond during periods of rapid structural change .
in practice , this means two things .
first , once a collective choice is made about the desired levels of social insurance , the implied liabilities should be fully funded over time .
the alternative is a poor intergenerational burden-sharing choice .
second , governments , like individuals , households , and businesses , need to save for a rainy day .
that is all the more important in periods – like the current one – of rapid change , high volatility , and only partly predictable systemic instability .

why talk to iran ?
washington , dc – june 12 marks the first anniversary of mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s disputed re-election as iran ’ s president .
meanwhile , the crisis over iran ’ s nuclear program is escalating .
the iranian regime continues to defy the international community ’ s efforts to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons .
in response , us president barack obama ’ s administration has been working through the united nations security council to impose tougher economic sanctions . nonetheless , iran edges toward mastering the process of enriching uranium to weapons-grade purity .
the closer iran gets to developing a nuclear weapon , the greater the likelihood that israel , with or without us help , might attack iran ’ s nuclear facilities .
the iranian government ’ s intransigence , its blatant efforts to mislead nuclear inspectors , its odious calls for the destruction of israel , its brutal repression of political opponents – all provide good reason for obama to slam the door shut on dialogue .
with diplomacy having failed to curb iran ’ s nuclear ambitions , critics of engagement charge , it is time to resort to coercion before iran crosses the nuclear rubicon .
a rising chorus of voices now forswears engagement with iran ’ s rulers , insisting that it is time for the regime to go .
but closing off dialogue with iran would be a precipitous and dangerous mistake .
as my new book , how enemies become friends , confirms , even fierce adversaries can settle their differences through negotiation .
for four compelling reasons , the us and its allies should keep the door open to dialogue until the eleventh hour .
first , tighter sanctions make sense only as a diplomatic tool , not as a blunt instrument of coercion .
the new sanctions simply are not severe enough to intimidate iran into submission , and more restrictive ones would not pass muster within the security council .
accordingly , if tougher sanctions prove to be useful , they will do so by confronting iran with a united diplomatic front , thereby encouraging its government to make a deal in order to end the country ’ s isolation .
new sanctions are warranted , but as a complement , not an alternative , to diplomacy .
second , the costs of abandoning diplomacy are so high that continued engagement makes sense even as iran refuses to budge .
to give up on diplomacy is to leave the international community with two ugly options : living with a nuclear iran or carrying out a preventive military strike against iran ’ s nuclear installations .
should iran possess the ultimate weapon , it might embrace a new restraint in its foreign policy ; nuclear-weapons states , precisely because they confront the prospect of nuclear retaliation , have historically tread with caution .
but the iranian regime is no ordinary government ; it may not adhere to the normal practices of nuclear restraint .
even if it does , a nuclear iran may trigger an arms race in the region and embolden an iranian government that already supports extremist movements throughout the middle east .
an american security umbrella over the persian gulf and israel might calm nerves , but it would do little to counter increased iranian support of islamic radicals .
a military strike would likely have worse consequences .
even if a strike was an operational success , it would only set back iran ’ s nuclear program by several years – while giving the regime a new incentive to acquire a nuclear deterrent and build better hidden and defended nuclear facilities .
in response to an attack , iran might well seek to obstruct shipping in the persian gulf , potentially triggering oil shortages and soaring prices .
and it could launch attacks on us , european , and israeli targets on a global basis .
such prospects make continued diplomacy , however elusive the prospects of success , nothing short of mandatory .
the third reason for pursuing dialogue is that factional infighting and political intrigue within the iranian regime make for considerable political fluidity .
admittedly , turmoil in tehran brings in@@ constancy to iran ’ s foreign policy , warranting caution about the prospects for a meaningful diplomatic breakthrough .
but internal jockeying for power also means that a coali@@ tional alignment favoring a negotiated settlement just might fall into place .
ahmadinejad himself , after all , late last year voiced enthusiasm for a western proposal to break the logjam by exporting iran ’ s uranium for processing abroad , only to reverse course soon thereafter . then last month , he reversed course again , working with brazil and turkey to craft a watered-down version of the original proposal .
ahmadinejad may be bo@@ bbing and weaving . but his mercurial ways make it plausible that he may find it politically advantageous to strike a serious bargain on the nuclear issue . just in case , the diplomatic door should remain ajar .
finally , even as stalemate continues on iran ’ s uranium enrichment , continued engagement may offer a round@@ about means of arriving at a bargain on the nuclear issue .
dialogue with the us could focus on areas , such as iraq and afghanistan , where the two parties share a measure of common ground .
joint efforts to combat drug trafficking in afghanistan , for example , could help dilute the mutual antagonism and distrust that contribute to blockage on the nuclear front .
iran remains several years away from mastering the technology needed to build nuclear weapons , which provides time to search for such diplomatic openings .
with iran having spurned obama ’ s offers of compromise , it is tempting for the us administration to turn its back on dialogue .
but the stakes are too high to abandon engagement .
even with new sanctions in the offing , dialogue still offers the best prospect for peacefully resolving what may be the world ’ s most dangerous dispute .

why target big banks ?
london – it seemed that a new model for global governance had been forged in the white heat of the financial crisis .
but now that the ashes are cooling , different perspectives on bank regulation are emerging on either side of the atlantic .
the emphasis in europe has been on regulating financial markets with a view to moderating future crises .
credit mistakes are made during the boom , not during the crash , so the argument goes .
better regulation and monetary policy during the boom years , therefore , could limit the scale of any bust .
by contrast , the emphasis in the united states has been on finding market-friendly ways to contain spillovers from bank failure .
policy debates in the us are chiefly preoccupied with ensuring that banks are never “ too big to fail ” ; that private investors rather than taxpayers hold “ contingent capital , ” which in a crash can be converted into equity ; and that “ over-the-counter ” markets ’ functioning be improved through greater reliance on centralized trading , clearing , and settlements .
the chief point of intersection between the european and us approaches is major banks .
this convergence has less to do with regulatory thinking on bank size or function than with a common need to play to the political gallery and raise more tax revenue .
banks ’ balance sheets are systemically dangerous when bloated by leverage , and it is this that regulatory or fiscal policy should address through liquidity buffers and leverage ratios .
after all , it is the contagi@@ ousness of financial crises , not banks ’ size , that matters .
any list conjured up in 2006 of institutions that were “ too big to fail ” would not have included northern rock , bradford &amp; bingley , ikb , bear sterns , or even lehman brothers .
banks lend to banks , so while some are more illiquid than others , they are all intrinsically illiquid institutions .
small failures can give birth to large panics , which means that in a crisis almost everyone is “ too big to fail . ”
the reality is that we can have as large a financial boom and subsequent bust as we just experienced , resulting in the same economic misery , in a world made up only of small banks .
many argue that bankers ’ belief that their institutions are too big to fail and that their jobs are safe encourages them to underestimate the risks that they assume .
but if that belief dominated bankers ’ thinking , they would still worry about their savings .
in other words , they would not wrap themselves up in their institutions ’ equity and the leveraged products they were selling .
yet they did .
the revealed preference of banks ’ and bankers ’ behavior is that they did not lend more because they thought they could get away with it , but because they thought it was safe .
they were fools more than kna@@ ves .
the main driver of excessive lending and leverage is a mistaken view of risk that is shared by everyone .
the riskiest institutions were not the largest : firms like j. p. morgan and hsbc proved safer than others , and neither sought nor needed state funding .
those that failed were relatively small , like ikb , bear sterns , and so on .
big banks like the idea that regulation should care less about banks ’ size and more about their riskiness , and so champion a “ risk-sensitive ” approach – not least because they have the bigger risk-management operations and databases , so risk-sensitive regulation is more onerous for their smaller competitors .
but this approach suffers from a fatal fallacy : if booms are fueled by underestimation of risks , and regulation is made more sensitive to the estimation of risks , booms will be bigger and busts deeper .
a better argument for curbing bank size is the excessive influence of big banks on policy@@ .@@ what policymakers should therefore be looking for is regulation that makes the financial system less sensitive to error in markets ’ estimation of risk , not more so .
there are two ways to do this .
the first is to observe that this error is correlated with the boom-bust cycle .
booms have similar characteristics – strong growth in banks ’ balance sheets and credit , and therefore a rise in leverage .
these trends imply an increased probability that the market is underestimating risk , so systemic risk regulators should raise minimum capital requirements as soon as they spot them .
counter-cyclical capital requirements fit with this idea , and a range of indicators could be used to calibrate the increase in capital requirements , coupled perhaps with some discretion .
there are many reasons why the market fails to correct systemic error , including that booms are always founded on a belief by both regulators and bankers that “ this time it is different . ”
let ’ s not forget the essays in central banks ’ stability reports on how credit derivatives were benefiting the financial sector .
the second way to reduce the financial system ’ s sensitivity to risk-@@ estimation errors is to limit the flow of risks to institutions with a structural , rather than a statistical , capacity for holding that risk .
that way , when the risk modelers get it wrong , we will be in less trouble .
credit risk is best hedged through diversification across uncorrelated credits .
liquidity risk is best hedged through diversification across time .
market risk is best hedged through a combination of diversification across assets and enough time to decide when to sell .
in the past , risks with volatility of similar statistical magnitudes were considered to be fungible , and , could flow to whomever was prepared to bear them .
but , while banks with short-term funding and many branches originating loans have a deep capacity for holding credit risks , they have a limited capacity for holding market risks , and little capacity for holding liquidity risk .
the lesson for regulators is simple : capacity for risk is related to the maturity of funding , not to what an institution is called .

brussels – as europe picks over the ruins of the mega-@@ merger that would have created a world-beating new aerospace and defense giant , questions are being asked about the inglorious role that the european union played in the fiasco .
the european commission ’ s failure to champion the $ 50 billion merger of the franco-german european aeronautic defence and space company ( eads ) , owner of airbus , and the united kingdom ’ s bae systems is being seen as a crucial factor in the deal ’ s collapse .
the integration of the two high-tech aviation and avionics leaders had looked like an eu-@@ inspired blueprint for industrial success .
for several years , eu leaders have been urging the consolidation of europe ’ s defense industries , so the proposed deal – which originated in the corporate boardrooms of eads and bae systems – looked like an answer to their calls .
yet both the commission and the european parliament kept silent and withheld the political support that might have ensured that the deal went through .
a timely reminder by eu leaders of the strategic importance of the aerospace sector would have helped allay many of the misgivings in berlin , and to a lesser degree in london , that ultimately sank the deal .
aviation , like defense , is the sharpest of the r &amp; d cutting edges available to advanced countries , and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs .
nationalist squabbles over the details of the merger would surely have been attenuated by a statesmanlike intervention from the commission in brussels .
it was therefore a bizarre coincidence that the merger ’ s collapse came on the day that the commission unveiled its new industrial strategy for regaining europe ’ s competitive edge in the face of asian and north american competition .
one of the most powerful arguments for the eads-bae marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years china will challenge airbus and boeing in the global aviation market , while also creating a powerful new defense industry .
that scenario now looks all the more likely .
why , then , did the european commission remain silent ?
the answer appears to be that it feared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the merger talks , and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public rebuff .
the persistent rumor circulating among defense company executives is that soon after news of the proposed merger leaked , the weekly commissioners ’ meeting chaired by commission president josé manuel barroso was enjo@@ ined to keep silent on the matter in order to avoid any potential dangers .
whether true or not , the important point is that the merger transcended national considerations , and the european commission had a duty to involve itself .
the eu ’ s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind europe ’ s efforts to revive laggard industries and fight to reverse the long-term economic decline that the eurozone crisis appears to presage .
nobody is arguing that the commission is responsible for the deal ’ s unhappy end – only that it should have rallied support for it .
the significance of the merger ’ s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across europe , especially in germany , where the media have been extremely critical of how “ negative politics ” sealed the proposed merger ’ s fate .
with the eu in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign-debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision-making architecture , the collapse of the eads-bae merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books .
but it may be said to mark the point when the european commission openly acknowledged that it has become little more than a secretariat to eu governments .
that is a far cry from the political powerhouse that some europeans fear – and for which others still hope .

should central banks target employment ?
washington , dc – on december 12 , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke announced that the fed will keep interest rates at close to zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 % , provided inflation expectations remain subdued .
while the fed ’ s governing statutes , unlike those of the european central bank , explicitly include a mandate to support employment , the announcement marked the first time that the fed tied its interest-rate policy to a numerical employment target .
it is a welcome breakthrough , and one that should be emulated by others – not least the ecb .
central banks ’ statutes differ in terms of the objectives that they set for monetary policy .
all include price stability .
many add a reference to general economic conditions , including growth and employment or financial stability .
some give the central bank the authority to set an inflation target unilaterally ; others stipulate coordination with the government in setting the target .
there is no recent example , however , of a major central bank setting a numerical employment target .
this should change , as the size of the employment challenge facing the advanced economies becomes more apparent .
weak labor markets , low inflation , and debt overhang suggest that a fundamental re-ordering of priorities is in order .
in japan , shinzo abe , the incoming prime minister , is signaling the same set of concerns , although he seems to be proposing a “ minimum ” inflation target for the bank of japan , rather than a link to growth or employment .
the spread of global value-chains that integrate hundreds of millions of developing-country workers into the global economy , as well as new labor-saving technologies , imply little chance of cost-@@ push wage inflation .
likewise , the market for long-term bonds indicates extremely low inflation expectations ( of course , interest rates are higher in cases of perceived sovereign default or re-denomination risk , such as in southern europe , but that has nothing to do with inflation ) .
moreover , the deleveraging underway since the 2008 financial implosion could be easier if inflation were moderately higher for a few years , a debate the international monetary fund encouraged a year ago .
together with these considerations , policymakers should take into account the tremendous human and economic costs of high unemployment , ranging from the millions of shattered lives , skills erosion , and disappearance of opportunities for an entire generation , to the dead-@@ weight loss of idle human resources .
is the failure to ensure that millions of young people acquire the skills required to participate in the economy not as great a liability for a society as a large stock of public debt ?
nowhere is this reordering of priorities more needed than in the eurozone .
yet , strangely , it is the fed , not the ecb , that has set an unemployment target .
the us unemployment rate has declined to around 7.7 % and the current-account deficit is close to $ 500 billion , while eurozone unemployment is at a record high , near 12 % , and the current account shows a surplus approaching $ 100 billion .
if the ecb ’ s inflation target were 3 % , rather than close to but below 2 % , and germany , with the world ’ s largest current-account surplus , encouraged 6 % wage growth and tolerated 4 % inflation – implying modest real-wage growth in excess of expected productivity gains – the eurozone adjustment process would become less politically and economically costly .
indeed , the policy calculus in northern europe greatly underestimates the economic losses due to the disruptions imposed on the south by excessive austerity and wage deflation .
the resulting high levels of youth unemployment , health problems , and idle production capacity also all have a substantial impact on demand for imports from the north .
contrary to conventional wisdom , the ecb ’ s legal mandate would allow such a re-ordering of priorities , as , with reference to the ecb , the treaty on the functioning of the european union states that “ the primary ( emphasis added ) objective of the european system of central banks … shall be to maintain price stability , ” and there is another part of the treaty dealing with general eurozone economic policies that emphasizes employment .
this would seem not to preclude a temporary complementary employment objective for the ecb at a time of exceptional challenge .
moreover , the ecb has the authority to set the eurozone-wide inflation target , and could set it higher for two or three years , without any treaty violation .
the real problem is the current political attitude in germany .
somehow , the memory of hyperinflation in the early 1920 ’ s seems scarier than that of massive unemployment in the early 1930 ’ s , although it was the latter that fueled the rise of nazism .
maybe the upcoming german elections will allow progressive forces to clarify what is at stake for germany and europe – indeed , the entire world .
in a more global context , none of this is to dismiss the longer-term dangers of inflation .
in most countries , at most times , inflation should be kept very low – and central banks should anchor inflation expectations with a stable long-term target , although the alternative of targeting nominal gdp deserves to be discussed .
moreover , monetary policy cannot be a long-term substitute for structural reforms and sustainable budgets .
long periods of zero real interest rates carry the danger of asset bubbles , misallocation of resources , and unintended effects on income inequality , as recent history – not least in the us and japan – demonstrates .
for the coming 2-3 years , however , particularly in europe , the need for deleveraging , the costs of widespread joblessness , and the risk of social collapse make the kind of temporary unemployment target announced by the fed highly desirable .

china ’ s american bailout ?
zurich – the twenty-first-century economy has thus far been shaped by capital flows from china to the united states – a pattern that has suppressed global interest rates , helped to reflate the developed world ’ s leverage bubble , and , through its impact on the currency market , fueled china ’ s meteoric rise .
but these were no ordinary capital flows .
rather than being driven by direct or portfolio investment , they came primarily from the people ’ s bank of china ( pboc ) , as it amassed $ 3.5 trillion in foreign reserves – largely us treasury securities .
the fact that a single institution wields so much influence over global macroeconomic trends has caused considerable anxiety , with doomsayers predicting that doubts about us debt sustainability will force china to sell off its holdings of us debt .
this would drive up interest rates in the us and , ultimately , could trigger the dollar ’ s collapse .
but selling off us treasury securities , it was argued , was not in china ’ s interest , given that it would drive up the renminbi ’ s exchange rate against the dollar , diminishing the domestic value of china ’ s reserves and undermining the export sector ’ s competitiveness .
indeed , a us defense department report last year on the national-security implications of china ’ s holdings of us debt concluded that “ attempting to use us treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to china than to the &#91; us &#93; . ”
to describe the symbiotic relationship between china ’ s export-led gdp growth and america ’ s excessive consumption , the economic historians niall ferguson and moritz schularick coined the term “ chimerica . ”
the invocation of the chimera of greek mythology – a monstrous , fire-breathing amalgam of lion , goat , and dragon – makes the term all the more appropriate , given that chimerica has generated massive and terrifying distortions in the global economy that cannot be corrected without serious consequences .
in 2009 , these distortions led ferguson and schularick to forecast chimerica ’ s collapse – a prediction that seems to be coming true .
with the reserves ’ long-term effects on china ’ s internal economic dynamics finally taking hold , selling off foreign-exchange reserves is now in china ’ s interest .
over the last decade , the vast quantities of short-term capital that were being pumped into china ’ s banking system drove commercial banks and other financial institutions to expand credit substantially , especially through the shadow-banking system , leading to a massive credit bubble and severe over-investment .
in order to manage the resulting increase in risk , china ’ s new leaders are now refusing to provide further liquidity injections , as well as curbing loans to unprofitable sectors .
but these efforts could trigger a financial crisis , requiring china to initiate a major recapitalization of the banking system .
in such a scenario , non-performing loans in china ’ s banking system would probably amount to roughly $ 1 trillion .
the most obvious means of recapitalizing china ’ s banks would be to inject renminbi-denominated government debt into the banking sector .
but china ’ s total public debt , including off-balance-sheet local-government financing vehicles , probably amounts to around 70 % of gdp already .
despite debate over the details , the conclusion of carmen reinhart and kenneth rogoff – that a high debt / gdp ratio can inhibit economic growth – remains widely accepted ; so it is unlikely that raising the debt ratio to 100 % would be in china ’ s long-term interest .
even if china ’ s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal latitude to pursue such a strategy , they probably would not , owing to the risk of inflation , which , perhaps more than any other economic variable , tends to lead to social unrest .
fortunately for china , the negative consequences of such a move would probably be far less severe than previously thought .
to be sure , an injection of us treasuries into the banking sector , and their subsequent conversion to renminbi , would still strengthen china ’ s currency .
but the rise would most likely be offset by capital outflows , as looser capital controls would enable savers to escape the financial crisis .
moreover , even if the renminbi became stronger in the short term , china is no longer as dependent on maintaining export competitiveness as it once was , given that , excluding assembly and reprocessing , exports now contribute less than 5 % of china ’ s gdp .
against this background , the us federal reserve , rather than focusing only on “ tapering ” its monthly purchases of long-term securities ( quantitative easing ) , must prepare itself for a potential sell-off of us debt .
given that a fed-@@ funded recapitalization of china ’ s banking system would negate the impact of monetary policy at home , driving up borrowing costs and impeding gdp growth , the fed should be ready to sustain quantitative easing in the event of a chinese financial crisis .
after spending years attempting to insulate the us economy from the upshot of its own banking crisis , the fed may ultimately be forced to bail out china ’ s banks , too .
this would fundamentally redefine – and , one hopes , rebalance – us-china relations .

why the fed should postpone rate hikes
jackson hole , wyoming – as central bankers from around the world gather this week in jackson hole for the federal reserve ’ s annual economic policy symposium , one key topic of discussion will be the current global stock-market turmoil .
there are many reasons for these gyrations , but the expectation that the fed will start to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as september – is clearly one of them .
the arguments for a rate hike are valid .
the united states ’ economy is gaining traction .
the international monetary fund forecasts 3 % annual growth in 2015 and 2016 , accompanied by inflation rates of 0.1 % and 1.5 % , respectively .
when an economy is normalizing , it is reasonable to reduce expansionary measures , such as those introduced after the crisis of 2008 .
because the fed has clearly communicated that it will move gradually toward less expansionary policies , its credibility would be damaged if it did not follow through .
but there are strong reasons for the fed to postpone interest-rate hikes and to keep monetary policy expansionary over the coming quarters .
for starters , the us recovery remains weak .
historically , 3 % growth during a recovery is far from impressive .
in other recent recoveries , growth often hit 4 % or even 5 % when increased capacity utilization pushed up productivity and investment .
over the past three decades , the us has been able to grow at an average annual rate of around 2.5 % .
some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors , which have reduced the labor force , as well as to weak productivity levels , which have been low .
but america ’ s potential output may be underestimated , and its inflation propensity exaggerated .
the us labor market works well .
unemployment is down to 5 % , with no signs of overheating .
the employment cost index suggests that wage increases so far have been surprisingly low .
one reason for this is that labor-market flexibility increased during the recovery .
self-employment , short-term contracts , or part-time arrangements account for many of the jobs that have been created over the past few years .
full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits are now much rarer .
this ongoing “ uberization ” of the us labor market means that the balance in the wage-setting process has shifted .
as a result , it will take longer for demand to feed through to wages and inflation than in the past .
moreover , the economy is undergoing an ongoing technological shift stemming from digitization and globalization .
estimates from citigroup indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrupted in the coming decades .
jobs that require lower skills and less training are particularly vulnerable ; but it is also clear that many other occupational categories – including administration , accounting , logistics , banking , and various service activities – are likely to be affected .
companies will be able to reduce their head@@ count and production costs while improving customer service , which , like uberization , will affect the wage-setting process .
central bankers , i believe , are underestimating the impact of this structural shift .
in the more tech-@@ oriented economies , like the us , the united kingdom , and the nordic countries , there is a risk that traditional macroeconomic models will overestimate the cost pressure from labor .
another reason why the fed should postpone a rate hike is that financial turmoil in emerging markets , particularly china , could have a substantial impact on the global economy , with some clear implications for the us economy .
in particular , lower energy and commodity prices are likely to dampen inflationary pressure .
when inflation is low for a long period , inflation expectations also tend to be low .
add falling commodity and energy prices to the mix and there is a risk that inflation expectations will remain too low to sustain a balanced recovery .
the global implications of lower emerging-market currencies are also likely to be deflationary .
the direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods .
the indirect effect , which might be substantial , is that cost-competitive light manufacturing in emerging markets increases .
that would reinforce the deflationary pressure from globalization for years to come .
there is also a risk of greater currency-market volatility if the fed jumps the gun in raising rates .
but , because they flooded global markets with liquidity , large portfolio flows have moved into emerging-market countries , whose currencies often are not as liquid as the dollar .
when investment moves back into dollars , the currency fluctuations in these less liquid markets can become excessive .
the fed clearly has a responsibility to consider how its policy decisions affect the global financial system .
excessive currency volatility is not in america ’ s interest , not least because large exchange-rate depreciations in emerging markets would amplify the effects of globalization on us jobs , wages , and inflation , particularly as weaker foreign currencies make outsourcing a more economically viable solution .
another reason for the fed to reconsider hiking rates is that the legitimacy of the bretton woods institutions depends on a well-functioning global financial system .
the global economy ’ s center of gravity is moving to asia , latin america , and africa , but the imf and the world bank still seem to mirror the reality of the 1950s .
if the fed is seen as unleashing a major crisis in emerging markets , this will almost certainly do long-term damage to the global financial system .
the fed should regard lower commodity prices , reduced inflationary pressures , changes in the labor market , and further disruptive technological shifts as sufficiently convincing arguments to postpone a rate hike .
including the risk of excessive volatility in the global financial system tips the balance even further .
there is plenty of time for the fed to signal that its policy stance has shifted , and the conclave in jackson hole is an excellent opportunity to start that communication .
if the facts have changed , the policy implications must also change .
the greatest loss of credibility always comes when policymakers try to ignore changing realities .

why the greek bailout failed
even if negotiators overcome the most recent sticking points , it will be difficult to trust in their implementation if the greek people remain unconvinced .
that has certainly been the experience so far .
and without structural reform , there is little chance that the greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay . ( this has been the case through most of the crisis , even if one would never know it from the world press coverage . )
greece ’ s membership in the european union gives its creditors significant leverage , but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus .
greece remains very much a sovereign country , not a sub-@@ sovereign state .
the “ troika ” of creditors – the international monetary fund , the european central bank , and the european commission – simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over greece that , say , the municipal assistance corporation wielded over new york city when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s .
the best structural-adjustment programs are those in which the debtor country ’ s government proposes the policy changes , and the imf helps design a bespoke program and provides the political cover for its implementation .
imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option .
so , for reforms to take hold , the greek government and its electorate must believe in them .
that a country must take ownership of its reform program is not a new lesson .
the imf ’ s rocky relationship with ukraine began long before the latest round of negotiations .
back in 2013 , imf staff wrote a sobering report on the organization ’ s experience in the country .
their conclusion , in essence , was that the government ’ s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed that its program would not work .
if a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments , the report argued , the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented , as is now being done in greece .
unfortunately , that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there .
structural-reform conditions often tilt the balance between competing domestic factions , for better or for worse .
if there is no will inside the country to maintain the reforms , they will quickly be undermined .
left-wing ideologues have long viewed structural-reform programs with deep suspicion , accusing international lenders like the imf and the world bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists .
this critique has some truth in it , but is overblown .
to be sure , structural reforms often favor policies like labor-market flexibility .
but one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black-and-white terms .
breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers ( as they do in much of southern europe , including italy and , to some extent , france ) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers .
making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stin@@ gier .
making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes .
recently , opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections – most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero .
if structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices , it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand .
but a similar critique could be made of any other change in policy : if it is poorly designed , it will be counter-productive .
the truth is that the way forward in europe requires achieving greater productivity .
the lessons from greece and other unsuccessful bailout programs are sobering .
if a debt bailout program requires a wholesale change in a country ’ s economic , social , and political model , the best course of action might be to write off the private losses , rather than pour in public money to cover them .
in cases like greece , the creditors ’ passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home – particularly toward improving financial regulation .
the vast majority of greeks want to stay in the eu .
in an ideal world , offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern european state .
but given the difficulty greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal , it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely .
in place of a program providing the country with further loans , it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid – regardless of whether greece remains fully within the eurozone .

why the greek deal will work
london – now that greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the european central bank and the international monetary fund , does greece ’ s near-death experience mark the end of the euro crisis ?
the conventional answer is a clear no .
according to most economists and political commentators , the latest greek bailout was little more than an analgesic .
it will dull the pain for a short period , but the euro ’ s deep-seated problems will metastasize , with a dismal prognosis for the single currency and perhaps even the european union as a whole .
but the conventional wisdom is likely to be proved wrong .
the deal between greece and the european authorities is actually a good one for both sides .
rather than marking the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis , the agreement may be remembered as the culmination of a long series of political compromises that , by correcting some of the euro ’ s worst design flaws , created the conditions for a european economic recovery .
to express guarded optimism about the greek deal is not to condone the provocative arrogance of former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis or the pointless vindictiveness of german finance minister wolfgang schäuble .
neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives like joseph stiglitz and conservatives like hans-werner sinn .
the arguments against creating a european single currency and then allowing greece to cheat its way into membership were valid back in the 1990s – and , in theory , they still are .
but this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be desirable , or even tolerable .
joining the euro was certainly ruinous for greece , but there is always “ a great deal of ruin in a nation , ” as adam smith remarked 250 years ago , when losing the american colonies seemed to threaten britain with financial devastation .
the great virtue of capitalism is that it adapts to ruinous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to advantage .
the united states in the mid-nineteenth century was badly suited for a single currency and a single economic structure , as evidenced by the civil war , which was provoked as much by single-currency tensions as by moral abhorrence to slavery .
italy would probably be better off today if garibaldi had never launched unification .
but once unification has happened , the pain of dismantling the political and economic settlement usually overwhelms the apparent gains from a break-up .
this seems to be the case in europe , as clear majorities of voters are saying in all eurozone countries , including germany and greece .
thus , the question was never whether the single currency would break up , but what political reversals , economic sacrifices , and legal subterfuges would occur to hold it together .
the good news is that europe now has some persuasive answers .
indeed , europe has overcome what could be described as the “ original sin ” of the single-currency project : the maastricht treaty ’ s prohibition of “ monetary financing ” of government deficits by the ecb and the related ban on mutual support by national governments of one another ’ s debt burdens .
in january , ecb president mario draghi effectively sidestepped both obstacles by launching a program of quantitative easing so enormous that it will finance the entire deficits of all eurozone governments ( now including greece ) and mutualize a significant proportion of their outstanding bonds .
moreover , european governments have belatedly understood the most basic principle of public finance .
government debts never have to be repaid , provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money , issued by a credible central bank .
but for this to be possible , interest payments must always be made on time , and the sanctity of debt contracts must always take precedence over electoral promises regarding pensions , wages , and public spending .
now that prime minister alexis tsipras ’ s government has been forced to acknowledge the unqualified priority of debt servicing , and can now benefit from unlimited monetary support from the ecb , greece should have little problem supporting its debt burden , which is no heavier than japan ’ s or italy ’ s .
finally , germany , spain , italy , and several northern european countries required , for domestic political reasons , a ritual humiliation of radical greek politicians and voters who openly defied eu institutions and austerity demands .
having achieved this , eu leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout .
instead , they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their “ tough love ” policies by easing austerity to accelerate economic growth , not only in greece but throughout the eurozone .
this raises a key issue that the tsipras government and many others misunderstood throughout the greek crisis : the role of constructive hypocrisy in europe ’ s political economy .
gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems , but these become huge in a complex multinational structure like the eu .
on paper , the greek bailout will impose a fiscal tightening , thereby aggravating the country ’ s economic slump .
in practice , however , the budget targets will surely be allowed to slip , provided the government carries out its promises on privatization , labor markets , and pension reform .
these structural reforms are much more important than fiscal targets , both in symbolic terms for the rest of europe and for the greek economy .
moreover , the extension of ecb monetary support to greece will transform financial conditions : interest rates will plummet , banks will recapitalize , and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010 .
if budget targets were strictly enforced by bailout monitors , which seems unlikely , this improvement in conditions for private borrowers could easily compensate for any modest tightening of fiscal policy .
in short , the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in greece .
conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points ; so the near-universal belief today that greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair .

transatlantic free trade ?
madrid – this month , the united states national intelligence council released a sobering report entitled global trends 2030 : alternative worlds .
most important , according to the authors , if current trends continue , asia could soon surpass north america and europe in global power .
it will have a higher gdp , larger population , higher military spending , and more technological investment .
in this geopolitical context , europe and the us need each other more than ever , making greater transatlantic cooperation crucial .
this seems to be the approach that inspired outgoing us secretary of state hillary clinton ’ s recent speech at the brookings institution on us-european relations .
given the shift in global power and the prospect of us energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms , america is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order .
and , although asia is now america ’ s strategic priority , europe is still the partner with which americans have the most in common .
“ i want to be clear , ” clinton noted .
“ our reorientation toward asia is not a withdrawal from europe . ”
the us , according to clinton , hopes that europe will follow suit , so that asia is seen not only as a market , but also as a focus of common strategic action .
but , beyond that , as the us and europe seek to ensure their global roles , cooperation between them is more important than ever .
so now is the time for a bold initiative : the launch of a us-european union free-trade agreement .
clinton has already hinted at america ’ s readiness for this , mentioning the possibility of negotiating a complete agreement that would increase trade and stimulate growth on both sides of the atlantic .
the journalist david ignatius even dared to give it a name in a recent article in the washington post : taf@@ ta ( transatlantic free-trade agreement ) .
edward luce , writing in the financial times , preferred “ transatlantic partnership . ”
the us and the eu ( taken as a whole ) are not only the world ’ s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies ; they also maintain the world ’ s largest bilateral trade relationship .
american investment in europe is three times higher than it is in asia .
european investment in the us is eight times larger than its investments in china and india combined .
so transatlantic trade is crucial for both economies , particularly for job creation .
indeed , it is estimated that one-third of all bilateral us-eu trade consists of internal transfers by companies that operate in both markets .
although us and eu tariffs on each other ’ s marketed manufactured goods are already low ( below 3 % , on average ) , a free-trade agreement would be enormously beneficial in promoting further investment , thereby boosting economic growth and creating more jobs .
such an agreement could include trade in goods , services , financial instruments , and agriculture , and would necessitate greater compatibility of european and american regulations and legal norms , implying substantial savings .
moreover , the effects of such an agreement would be felt far beyond the us and europe .
for example , both have already signed free-trade treaties with various latin american countries , implying the creation of a geographically enormous free-trade area , which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis .
indeed , regional free-trade agreements are gaining momentum worldwide .
the trans-pacific partnership , a free-trade agreement spearheaded by the us , is set to be a game-changer in the asia-pacific region , with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015 .
potential signatories include the us , australia , malaysia , vietnam , singapore , new zealand , chile , peru , brunei , canada , mexico , and perhaps japan and south korea .
the result will be trade liberalization in an area that produces 40 % of global gdp .
isn ’ t it time to consider something similar for europe and the us ?
the eu , now confronting a wave of populism and euro-skepticism , could revive its sense of purpose by committing itself to closer transatlantic cooperation and coordination on trade , to be carried out by the european commission .
such a project has worked before in bringing europe together ; it can do so again .
the most precious asset today is confidence , and the mere fact of launching negotiations would generate it in abundance .
protectionism is no solution to the crisis , whereas a transatlantic free-trade agreement would favor multilateralism and openness .
in this sense , it is important to stress the work of the world trade organization , the best multilateral forum that the world has for resolving trade disputes .
signing a transatlantic trade treaty would be irrefutable proof that the political case for open trade can be made – and won .
the only way to achieve this is through the clear commitment of political leaders on both sides of the atlantic , together with private-sector involvement , which is fundamental to sustaining urgently needed economic growth .
but let ’ s not wait : faced with predictions of the west ’ s relative decline , the us and the eu must commit themselves to more union , more cooperation , and more prosperity .
today , that means a transatlantic free-trade agreement .

financial reform ’ s breakthrough year
zanzibar – here ’ s an odd prediction for the coming year : 2013 will be a watershed for financial reform .
true , while the global financial crisis erupted more than four years ago , and the dodd-frank financial reforms were adopted in the united states back in 2010 , not much has changed about how wall street operates – except that the large firms have become bigger and more powerful .
yet there are reasons to expect real progress in the new year .
the us federal reserve is finally shifting its thinking .
in a series of major speeches this fall , governor dan tarullo made the case that the problem of “ too big to fail ” financial institutions remains with us .
we need to take additional measures to reduce the level of systemic risk – including limiting the size of our largest banks .
news reports indicate that the fed has already started saying no to some bank mergers .
at the same time , the us federal deposit insurance corporation has become a bastion of sensible thinking on financial-sector issues .
in part , this is because the fdic is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial-sector firms fail , so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control .
the fdic is showing intellectual leadership as well as organizational capabilities – vice chairman tom hoenig ’ s speeches are a must-read .
wall street is pushing back , of course .
but the rolling series of scandals surrounding global megabanks makes it difficult for anyone to keep a straight face when executives insist that our largest banks must maintain their current scale and scope .
do we need hsbc to facilitate global money laundering ?
do we need barclays and ubs to manipulate libor ( a key benchmark for interest rates around the world ) ?
do we need still more losses at poorly run trading operations for jp morgan chase ?
the pro-bank lobby groups are positioning themselves to argue that the new resolution powers under dodd-frank have ended the too-big-to-fail problem , and we can expect a public-relations drive in this direction early in the new year .
but the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the fdic ’ s systemic resolution advisory committee ( of which i am a member ) was that this claim should not be taken seriously .
under dodd-frank , it is arguably easier for the fdic to handle the failure of a single large financial institution than it was in pre-@@ dodd-frank days .
but what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time ?
the answer , as former fed chairman paul volcker implied at the meeting , is that we would be right back where we started – in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 .
indeed , the idea that substantial shocks could soon hit the us financial system is not far-fetched .
the european debt crisis , for example , remains far from being resolved .
a significant sovereign-debt restructuring there would bring down european banks and potentially damage us banks – as well as financial institutions around the world .
meanwhile , the continuing problems at european banks are a stark reminder that operating highly leveraged , thinly capitalized firms is incredibly risky .
and the regulatory failures in europe – consider the german landes@@ banks , for example – will become only more obvious in the coming months .
creating a common supervisory authority will mean nothing unless it can clean up the mess created by the existing supervisors .
and that cleanup will expose more of the rot in banks ’ current operations .
the need for banks to finance themselves with more equity and relatively less debt will be the focus of one of the main publishing events in economics in 2013 . anat admati and martin hellwig ’ s the bankers ’ new clothes : what ’ s wrong with banking and what to do about it ? will appear officially in march , but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks .
bankers everywhere will rush to read it before their regulators do .
the road to the ongoing financial and economic crisis was built on a foundation of intellectual capture : not only regulators , but academics , too , became captivated by modern finance and its methods .
admati and hellwig are at the vanguard of the counterrevolution , challenging the great myths of banking head-on .
do we need financial institutions to be so highly leveraged ( that is , carrying so much debt relative to equity ) ?
no , they argue .
if banks of all kinds were financed with more equity , they would have stronger buffers to absorb losses .
both the equity and the debt issued by well-capitalized banks would be safer – and therefore cheaper .
bankers want to be so highly leveraged for a simple reason : implicit government guarantees mean that they get the upside when things go well , while the downside is someone else ’ s problem .
contrary to bankers ’ claims , this is not a good arrangement for society .
admati and hellwig are confronting the bankers and their allies in no uncertain terms , grounding their argument in deep financial thinking , yet writing for a broad audience .
whatever else happens in 2013 , we can be sure that they will not win the goldman sachs business book of the year award .

in defense of non-@@ visionaries
oxford – many of the recent tributes for margaret thatcher following her death celebrated her as a “ transformational ” leader who brought about great changes .
there were frequent references to her equally transformational american counterpart , ronald reagan .
but a more interesting comparison is with her other presidential contemporary , george h. w. bush .
though often dismissed as a mere “ transactional ” manager , bush had one of the best foreign-policy records of the past half-century .
his administration managed the end of the cold war , the dismantlement of the soviet union , and the unification of germany within nato – all without violence .
at the same time , he led a broad united nations-backed coalition that repelled saddam hussein ’ s aggression against kuwait .
had he dropped any of the balls he was juggling , today ’ s world would be much worse .
although he presided over a major global transformation , bush , by his own account , did not have transformational objectives .
on the unification of germany , he resisted the advice of thatcher and others , apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend , german chancellor helmut kohl .
in october 1989 , bush responded to a call from kohl by publicly stating that he did not “ share the concern that some european countries have about a reunified germany . ”
at the same time , he was careful to let kohl and others take the lead .
when the berlin wall was opened a month later , partly owing to an east german mistake , bush was criticized for his low-key response .
but bush had made a deliberate choice not to humiliate the soviets or gloat : “ i won ’ t beat on my chest and dance on the wall , ” was his response – a model of emotional intelligence in a leader .
such self-restraint helped to set the stage for the successful malta summit with soviet president mikhail gorbachev a month later .
the cold war ended quietly , and the dismantlement of the soviet empire followed .
as bush and his team responded to forces that were largely outside of his control , he set goals and objectives that balanced opportunities and constraints in a prudent manner .
but , in each instance , bush was limiting his short-term gains in order to pursue long-term stability .
other critics complained that bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding russian democracy , the middle east , or nuclear non-proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid .
but , again , bush remained more focused on maintaining global stability than on advancing new visions .
bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad , going to the us congress for authorization of the gulf war , and to the united nations for a resolution under chapter 7 of the un charter .
although a realist in his thinking , he could be wilsonian in his tactics .
bush ’ s termination of the ground war in iraq after only four days was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns about the slaughter of iraqi troops , as well as by an interest in not leaving iraq so weakened that it could not balance the power of neighboring iran .
while bush ’ s invasion of panama to capture ( and later put on trial ) manuel noriega may have violated panamanian sovereignty , it had a degree of de facto legitimacy , given noriega ’ s notorious behavior .
and , when bush organized his international coalition to prosecute the gulf war , he included several arab countries – not to ensure military success , but to boost the mission ’ s legitimacy .
when bush and thatcher met in aspen , colorado , in the summer of 1990 , thatcher allegedly warned him “ not to go wobbly . ” but most historians agree there was no such danger .
with his careful combination of hard and soft power , bush created a successful strategy – one that accomplished american goals in a manner that was not unduly insular and with minimal damage to the interests of foreigners .
he was careful not to humiliate gorbachev , and to manage the transition to boris yeltsin ’ s presidency in a newly independent russia .
of course , not all foreigners were adequately protected .
for example , bush assigned a low priority to kurds and shia in iraq , to dissidents in china , and to bosnians in the former yugoslavia .
in that sense , bush ’ s realism set limits to his cosmopolitanism .
could bush have done more had he been a transformational leader like thatcher or reagan ?
perhaps he might have done more in a second term .
and , with better communication skills , he might have been able to do more to educate the american public about the changing nature of the post-cold war world .
but , given the profound uncertainty of a world in flux , as well as the dangers of miscalculation as the soviet empire collapsed , prudent management trumped grand visions .
nonetheless , few people at the end of 1989 believed that germany could be reunited peacefully within the western alliance .
thatcher certainly did not .
the lesson is that in some circumstances , we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like george h. w. bush ( or dwight eisenhower before him ) , rather than by more flashy and inspirational transform@@ ers .

is europe america ’ s friend or foe ?
paris – since donald trump became us president in january 2017 , his conduct has been astonishingly erratic , but his policies have been more consistent than foreseen by most observers .
trump ’ s volatility has been disconcerting , but on the whole he has acted in accordance with promises made on the campaign trail and with views held long before anyone considered his election possible .
accordingly , a new cottage industry in rational theories of trump ’ s seemingly irrational behavior has developed .
the latest challenge is to make sense of his stance towards europe .
at a rally on june 28 , he said : “ we love the countries of the european union .
but the european union , of course , was set up to take advantage of the united states .
and you know what , we can ’ t let that happen . ” during his recent trip to the continent , he called the eu “ a foe ” and said it was “ possibly as bad as china . ”
regarding brexit , he declared that british prime minister theresa may should have “ sued ” the eu .
then came the truce , on july 25 : trump and jean-claude juncker , the president of the european commission , agreed to work jointly on an agenda of free trade and world trade organization reform .
so it seems we are friends again – or perhaps just resting before the dispute resumes .
but the deeper question remains : why has trump repeatedly attacked america ’ s oldest and most reliable ally ?
why does he seem to despise the eu so deeply ?
why should the us try to undermine europe , rather than seeking closer cooperation to protect its economic and geopolitical interests ?
trump ’ s approach is particularly striking given that china ’ s rapid emergence as a strategic rival is america ’ s main national security issue .
contrary to earlier hopes , china is converging with the west neither politically nor economically , because the role of the state and the ruling party in coordinating activities remains far greater .
geopolitically , china has been actively building clienteles , most visibly through its belt and road initiative , and it intends to “ foster a new type of international relations ” that departs from the model promoted by the us in the twentieth century .
obviously , china , not europe , is the number one challenge to us world supremacy .
former president barack obama ’ s china strategy combined dialogue and pressure .
he started building two mega-@@ economic alliances that excluded china and russia : the trans-pacific partnership with 11 other pacific rim countries , and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the european union .
but trump withdrew the us from the tpp and killed the ttip before it was born .
then he opened a trade rift with the eu .
and he has attacked both the eu and its member states , especially germany .
there are three possible explanations .
one is trump ’ s peculiar obsession with bilateral trade balances .
according to this view , trump regards germany , the rest of europe , and china as equally threatening competitors .
nobody else thinks this makes economic sense .
and the only result he can expect from this strategy is to hurt and weaken the long-standing atlantic partnership .
but he has been complaining about mercedes cars in the streets of new york city at least since the 1990s .
a second explanation is that trump wants to prevent the eu from positioning itself as the third player in a trilateral game .
if the us intends to turn the relationship with china into a bilateral power struggle , there are good reasons for it to regard the eu as an obstacle .
because it is itself governed by law , the eu is bound to oppose a purely transactional approach to international relations .
and a united europe that commands access to the world ’ s largest market is not a trivial player .
but after the eu has been undermined , if not disbanded , weak and divided european countries would have no choice but to rally behind the us .
finally , a more political reading of trump ’ s behavior is that he is seeking regime change in europe .
in fact , he has not disguised his belief that europe is “ losing its culture ” because it has let immigration “ change its fabric . ”
and stephen bannon , his former chief strategist , has announced that he will spend half of his time in europe to help build an alliance of nationalist parties and win a majority in next may ’ s european parliament elections .
a few weeks ago , only the first reading looked plausible .
the other two could be dismissed as fantasies inspired by conspiracy theories .
no us president had ever presented the eu as a plot to weaken the us .
indeed , all of trump ’ s postwar predecessors would have recoiled in horror at the idea of the eu ’ s dissolution .
but the us president has gone too far for europe to dismiss the more dismal scenarios .
for the eu , this is a pivotal moment .
in the 1950s , it was launched beneath the us security umbrella and with america ’ s blessing .
since then , it has been built as a geopolitical experiment conducted under us protection and in the context of a us-led international system .
for this reason , its external dimensions – economically , diplomatically , or regarding security – have always come second to its internal development .
what the recent crisis signifies is that this is no longer true .
europe must now define its strategic stance vis-à-vis a more distant and possibly hostile us , and vis-à-vis rising powers that have no reason to be kind to it .
it must stand for its values .
and it must urgently decide what it intends to do regarding its security and defense , its neighborhood policy , and its border protection .
this is an acid test .
economically , the eu still has the potential to be a global player .
the size of its market , the strength of its major companies , a unified trade policy , a common regulatory policy , a single competition authority , and a currency that is second only to the dollar are major assets .
it could – and should – use them to push for a revamping of international relations that addresses legitimate us grievances vis-à-vis china and legitimate chinese concerns over its international role .
europe has played a leading role in fighting climate change ; it could do the same for trade , investment , or finance .
europe ’ s main problem is political , not economic . the challenge it is facing comes at a moment when it is divided between island and continent , north and south , and east and west .
and the questions posed are fundamental : what defines a nation ?
who is in charge of borders ?
who guarantees security ?
is the eu based on shared values or on the pure calculus of national interests ?
if the eu fails to define itself for a world that is fundamentally different from that of ten years ago , it probably will not survive as a meaningful institution .
if it does , however , it may regain the sense of purpose and legitimacy in the eyes of citizens that years of economic and political setbacks have eroded .

why turkey &apos;s army will stay home
just when the smoke from turkey ’ s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear , another deadly attack by kurdish separatists on turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern iraq .
that prospect raises risks for turkey , iraq , and the united states .
but there are reasons to doubt that the situation is as dangerous as recent headlines suggest .
turkey accuses iraqi kurds of harboring between 3,000 and 3,500 of turkey ’ s most active kurdish militants – the pkk separatist guerillas who are blamed for the deaths of 80 turkish soldiers so far this year .
the trouble reached the boiling point on october 7 , when kurdish fighters killed 13 turkish soldiers near turkey ’ s border with iraq .
the turkish public has demanded action , and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s government has responded .
on october 17 , despite pleas for patience and restraint from iraq and the us , turkish lawmakers voted 50@@ 7-@@ 19 to authorize erdogan to order cross-border military strikes into iraq at any time over the next year .
erdogan has sent iraqi kurds a forceful message .
but , for several reasons , the turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small-scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all-out war .
first , the turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in iraq ’ s sectarian strife .
a full-scale invasion might well provoke iraq ’ s own kurdish guerrillas into a prolonged and bloody battle with turkish forces that can only undermine support for erdogan ’ s government at home and abroad .
second , turkey ’ s government hopes to keep the country ’ s bid to join the european union moving forward .
an invasion of iraq would bring that process to a grinding halt .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana has made plain that europe strongly opposes any large-scale turkish military operation in iraq .
third , turkey is well aware that an all-out attack inside iraq is exactly what turkey ’ s kurdish separatists want .
what better way to damage turkey than to pull its military into conflict with iraq , the us , and the eu ?
erdogan has no intention of being drawn into that trap .
with all that in mind , this latest move by turkey ’ s parliament should be seen more as an ultimatum to iraq ’ s kurdish regional government to expel the turkish kurds and an attempt to persuade the us to use its considerable influence there .
that ’ s hardball politics , not a declaration of war .
the parliamentary authorization itself is carefully worded to underline turkey ’ s limited aims .
it stresses that turkey ’ s military has no intention of occupying iraqi territory or threatening iraqi kurds or their oil infrastructure .
an attack would certainly make iraq ’ s kurdish provinces less appealing for foreign investors . but turkey has no reason to attack the assets of foreign oil companies .
iraq ’ s central government is aware of the risks , as well , and is likely to exercise maximum restraint .
a limited turkish strike into northern iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of iraqi sovereignty .
threats to iraq ’ s oil infrastructure around the northern iraqi city of kirkuk and other territory under the kurdish regional government ’ s control are minimal .
turkey ’ s government knows that any move to shut down the 600-mile pipeline from kirkuk to turkey ’ s mediterranean port at ceyhan would have little near-term impact , since most of iraq ’ s oil exports flow from the south , hundreds of miles from the country ’ s border with turkey .
furthermore , the turkish military can increase the pressure on iraqi kurds with far less drastic measures .
it can close the two countries ’ principal border crossing , an important route for food , fuel , and other goods headed for iraqi kurds .
it could also cut exports of electricity to northern iraq .
still , even small-scale military operations would generate risk .
if the pkk is able to launch a major attack on troops or civilians inside turkey , the public outcry might leave erdogan with little choice but to up the ante .
the issue is complicated further by turkey ’ s refusal to negotiate directly with the kurdish regional government in northern iraq .
such talks , turkey fears , would offer tacit acknowledgement that iraqi kurds have won a degree of autonomy from baghdad .
that ’ s a bridge too far for turkey ’ s nationalists and its military .
there are risks for iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki as well , because turkish military strikes on iraq ’ s northern provinces could undermine the kurdish support on which his government increasingly depends .
both sunni arabs and kurds already resent al maliki ’ s mild reaction to iran ’ s recent shelling of iraqi territory – an attempt to strike at iranian kurdish militants fleeing across its border with iraq .
there are also risks for the us .
most supplies headed for us troops in iraq and afghanistan move through the incirlik airbase in turkey .
with the threat that the us house of representatives will approve a resolution that accuses turks of genocide against ethic armenians nine decades ago , this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over iraq .
but , worst-case scenarios aside , a turkish invasion of northern iraq can only serve the interests of turkey ’ s kurdish separatists .
that ’ s why cooler heads are likely to prevail .
limited cross-border operations are increasingly likely . a war between turkey and iraqi kurds is not .

why ukraine deserves a haircut
london – in addition to its many other troubles , ukraine now finds itself in a showdown with its creditors .
investors holding high-yielding bonds – many of them bought at heavy discounts after russia ’ s annexation of crimea last year – are demanding to be paid in full .
ukraine ’ s government , for its part , argues that the country ’ s financial difficulties – in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the plunge in the value of the hryvnia – have made its debt burden unsustainable .
the outcome of this standoff could determine ukraine ’ s future , as much as the military confrontation with russia .
recent developments have put the country on a path that would have been unimaginable until very recently .
for the first time in ukraine ’ s post-soviet history , it has a government that is willing and able to carry out real reform .
ukraine ’ s progress , however , could not be more fragile .
without some form of debt relief , it could easily be lost .
a little over a year ago , ukraine did not have an elected president or a representative and functioning parliament .
the political landscape was deeply fragmented .
civil society had been energized by the maidan revolution that ousted former president viktor yanukovych , but it was in turmoil .
debate over the association agreement with the european union , along with the russian-backed rebellion in the east , had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people ’ s lives .
but since parliamentary elections in october , ukraine has begun to pull itself together .
russia ’ s intervention has to some extent backfired , strengthening support for a european orientation .
eastern ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country , but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of europe .
the electorate also said no to the more virulent forms of nationalism , leaving the right-wing extremist parties marginalized .
the result of the elections was the formation of a five-@@ party governing coalition .
though seemingly fragile , it has held up remarkably well .
some of its members have displayed worrying populist tendencies , but an analysis of parliamentary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement , even on very difficult issues .
the government has , among other things , raised gas tariffs by 450 % ( from absurdly low levels ) .
dissension has been relatively moderate .
as a result , ukraine ’ s core institutions are undergoing fundamental change .
perhaps ukraine ’ s single most important achievement is the establishment of the national reform council .
originally set up to coordinate reforms across ministries and monitor their implementation , it has come to serve as an important tool to discuss and ensure coherence among the different branches of government .
this latter role is particularly important , given the constitutional ambiguity created by the reversion back to a parliamentary system and the uneasy co-@@ habitation of president petro poroshenko and prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk in government .
meetings are held every three weeks and are attended by the president , the prime minister , and his entire cabinet , providing a forum in which tensions can be discussed and eased .
in between meetings , the council ’ s special project-management office assists in the preparation and implementation of key reforms by ministries .
with support from the european bank for reconstruction and development , the george soros-funded international renaissance foundation , and bilateral assistance from , among others , the swedish government , the office has been able to hire staff at market rates , raising the quality of the government administration .
ukraine ’ s government has also benefited from the expertise of private-sector leaders .
deputy head of the presidential administration dmytro shym@@ kiv , who drove the national reform council , was ceo of microsoft ukraine .
finance minister natalie jaresko and economic development and trade minister aivaras abromavicius were both investment bankers ( neither was a ukrainian citizen when they joined the government ) .
infrastructure minister andriy pivo@@ var@@ sky , also a former investment banker , was most recently ceo of continium , one of the country ’ s largest holding companies .
each has played a key role in pushing the reform agenda forward , working for salaries that are orders of magnitude smaller than what they earned before .
some have even employed staff using their own money .
meanwhile , the ambitious agendas of the government ministers and the presidential administration are closely monitored by an energized civil society .
as soros has noted , ukraine probably has the most active civil society in europe .
one of the country ’ s most interesting new ventures is voxukraine , a blogging platform set up by two ukrainian economics professors based in the united states , yuriy gorodnichenko and timo@@ fi@@ y mylovanov .
they have championed modern evidence-based decision-making and constantly come up with new , constructive ways of challenging the government and its assumptions .
despite all this progress , however , the odds remain stacked against the country .
the government is fighting at least two wars simultaneously – taking on a deeply entrenched oligarchy , while trying to fend off its hostile eastern neighbor .
further trouble – in the form a steeply declining economy – is something it cannot afford .
the stakes could not be higher .
for the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992 , ukraine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform .
there are signs that the oligarchs ’ grip is beginning to loosen , owing partly to internal conflicts among them .
the eu and the us are working to help resolve its conflict with russia .
ukraine ’ s private creditors must now do their part , recognize the country ’ s economic and political situation , and accept a haircut on their bonds .
neither the ukrainian economy – nor its political system – can afford that they do otherwise .

when inflation doves cry
pittsburgh – the wall street journal recently ran a front-page article reporting that the monetary-policy “ doves , ” who had forecast low inflation in the united states , have gotten the better of the “ hawks , ” who argued that the fed ’ s monthly purchases of long-term securities , or so-called quantitative easing ( qe ) , would unleash faster price growth .
the report was correct but misleading , for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the us today .
were the doves right , or just lucky ?
the us federal reserve board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves , but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth .
neither the hawks nor the doves ( nor anyone else ) expected that .
monetarists insist that economies experience inflation when money-supply growth persistently exceeds output growth .
that has not happened yet , so inflation has been postponed .
instead of rejecting monetary theory and history , the army of wall street soothsayers should look beyond the fed ’ s press releases and ask themselves : does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience ?
are we really so confident that the fed has found a new way ?
the fed has printed new bank reserves with reckless abandon .
but almost all of the reserves sit idle on commercial banks ’ balance sheets .
for the 12 months ending in july , the st. louis fed reports that bank reserves rose 31 % .
during the same period , a commonly used measure of monetary growth , m2 , increased by only 6.8 % .
no sound monetarist thinks those numbers predict current inflation .
indeed , almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of qe , more than 95 % , are sitting in excess reserves , neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation .
the fed pays the banks 0.25 % to keep them idle .
with $ 2 trillion in excess reserves , and the prospect of as much as $ 85 billion added each month , banks receive $ 5 billion a year , and rising , without taking any risk .
for the bankers , that ’ s a bonanza , paid from monies that the fed would normally pay to the us treasury .
and , adding insult to injury , about half the payment goes to branches of foreign banks .
in normal times , there are valid reasons for paying interest on excess reserves .
currently , however , it is downright counter-productive .
bank loans have started to increase , but small borrowers , new borrowers , and start-up companies are regularly refused .
current low interest rates do not cover the risk that banks would take .
to be sure , they could raise the rate for new and small borrowers ; but , in the current political climate , they would stand accused of stifling economic recovery if they did .
the new consumer financial protection board is also a deterrent , as banks consider it safer to lend to the government , large corporations , and giant real-estate speculators .
the banks can report record profits without much risk , rebuild capital , and pay dividends and bonuses .
and the fed can congratulate itself on the mostly unobserved way that the large banks have used taxpayers ’ money .
instead of continuing along this futile path , the fed should end its open-ended qe3 now .
it should stop paying interest on excess reserves until the us economy returns to a more normal footing .
most important , it should announce a strategy for eliminating the massive volume of such reserves .
i am puzzled , and frankly appalled , by the fed ’ s failure to explain how it will restore its balance sheet to a non-inflationary level .
the announcements to date simply increase uncertainty without telling the public anything useful .
selling $ 2 trillion of reserves will take years .
it must do more than repeat that the fed can raise interest rates paid on reserves to encourage banks to hold them .
it will take a clearly stated , widely understood strategy – the kind that paul volcker introduced in 1979-@@ 1982 – to complete the job .
should the end of qe come in september , december , or later ?
does it matter ?
historically , the fed has typically been slow to respond to inflation .
waiting until inflation is here , as some propose , is the usual way .
but that merely fuels inflation expectations and makes the task more painful .
and how high will the fed push up interest rates ?
once rates get to 5 % or 6 % , assuming inflation remains dormant , the fed can expect a backlash from congress , the administration , unions , homebuilders , and others .
when contemplating the consequences of this , remember that 40 % of us government debt comes due within two years .
rolling it over at higher rates of 4 % or 5 % would add more than $ 100 billion to the budget deficit .
and that is just the first two years .
the budget cost increases every year , as more of the debt rolls over – and that does not include agency debt and the large increase in the current-account deficit to pay china , japan , and other foreign holders of us debt .
those who believe that inflation will remain low should look more thoroughly and think more clearly .
there are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial-market participants would rather forget .

send in the clowns
new york – when too many italians voted late last month for either a louche and discredited business tycoon or a comedian , european stock markets plummeted .
with no public trust in the political class , italy might become ungovernable .
but italians are not alone .
rage against the political establishment has become a global phenomenon .
chinese bloggers , american tea party activists , british europhobes , egyptian islamists , dutch populists , greek ultra-@@ rightists , and thai “ red shirts ” all have one thing in common : hatred of the status quo and contempt for their countries ’ elites .
we are living in an age of populism .
the authority of conventional politicians and traditional media is slipping away fast .
populism can be a necessary corrective when political parties grow sclerotic , mass media become too complacent ( or too close to power ) , and bureaucracies are unresponsive to popular needs .
in a globalized world managed by bankers and technocrats , many people feel that they have no say in public affairs ; they feel abandoned .
our national politicians , increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises , are suspected , often with good reason , of simply looking after their own interests .
all we can do is vote the rascals out , sometimes by voting for candidates whom we would not take seriously in more normal times .
italian elites are not the only ones in need of being shaken up .
but the problem with populism is that it is rarely benign .
in the 1930 ’ s , it resulted in violent movements led by dangerous men in uniform .
today ’ s populists are different .
they do not , on the whole , advocate violence .
some preach that muslims are destroying western civilization .
others think that president barack obama is a kind of communist out to destroy america .
two types of contemporary populist , however , stand out : the ultra-rich business tycoon and the clown .
in the anglo-saxon media world , rupert murdoch , owner of far too many newspapers , tv stations , and movie studios , is a typical populist tycoon .
but he never aspired to lead a country .
former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra did – and still do .
neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader .
the question is which is worse .
clowns have always played a role in politics .
medieval court j@@ esters were often the only ones who could speak truth to despotic kings .
today , it is often comedians who claim to speak truth to power – and to the public .
in america , liberals turn for political commentary to television comedians like jon stewart and stephen colbert , who are now more trusted than traditional news broadcasters .
and clownish right-wing radio talk-show hosts now have more influence on many conservative american voters than the sober journalists of the mainstream media do .
a few years ago , a clown named brozo , with a large red nose and a bright green wig , was mexico ’ s most popular political commentator on television , actively courted by all candidates running for national office .
in 1980 , the french clown coluche actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16 % , causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much .
the prototype of modern european populism was the flamboyant dutch political showman pim fortuyn , who was assassinated in 2002 by a fanatical vegan .
fortuyn ’ s outrageousness was deliberately provocative and always entertaining .
his rants against the elites were often confused , but he was funny , which made the old elite politicians look like stuffy old bo@@ res – which many of them were .
and now italy has beppe grillo , whose success in the country ’ s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in europe .
the thing about clowns , though , is that few have any aspirations to rule their countries .
before his death , fortuyn is said to have been terrified of the prospect of becoming prime minister .
and grillo cannot even aspire to the job in italy because of his criminal record .
clowns mostly seek to provoke , and this can be healthy .
they are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views .
and , sometimes , they actually say things that are uncomfortable but true , and that need to be said .
they attack the old elites not to shake things up , but to take their power .
promising to spread the riches that they have made for themselves , they exploit the fantasies of those of us who have little and want more .
berlusconi understood the dreams of many italians very well .
his extravagance , clow@@ nishness , and even his girls were part of his popular appeal .
like a beneficent king , he would give them money , and promised to challenge the old elites in bangkok – the bankers , generals , judges , and even the courtiers surrounding the thai king .
but tycoons are not natural democrats .
their main interest is in their own business .
and they do not hesitate to undermine an independent press or judiciary when their business interests are threatened .
even though his sister , yingluck shinawatra , is now in power , thaksin is still trying to evade trial in thai courts on a wide array of financial charges .
as it happens , thaksin was overthrown in 2006 by a military coup that was largely backed by the bangkok elites .
berlusconi was replaced by a government run by elite technocrats , whose policies had to be approved by european bankers and european union bureaucrats .
neither of these responses to populism is likely to boost democracy .
on the contrary , they make things worse .
what is needed is mainstream politicians who understand and respond to what is fueling popular rage .
paying attention to some of what the clowns are saying might be a good first step .

why don ’ t we trust our leaders ?
oxford – in developed democracies today , political leadership is increasingly up for grabs .
voters , clearly tired of the status quo , want change at the top , leaving even major parties ’ establishments struggling to install leaders of their choosing .
in the united kingdom , labour party mps have been stymied in their efforts to unseat jeremy corbyn as leader .
in japan , the ruling liberal democratic party ’ s preferred candidate for governor of tokyo , hiroya masuda , lost in a landslide to yuriko koike .
as for the united states , the republican party wanted virtually anybody except donald trump to win the nomination for the presidency ; yet trump it is .
and while the democratic party is being represented by the establishment choice , hillary clinton , her competitor , bernie sanders , put up a much stronger fight than virtually anyone anticipated .
the message to the establishment is clear : we don ’ t trust you anymore .
but some of the leaders voters do trust could pose a very real danger – to their supporters , their countries , and the world .
trump – with his admiration of dictators , unabashed racism and sexism , ignorance regarding the issues , and mercurial temperament – stands at the top of this list .
those who led the british campaign to leave the european union – such as conservatives like boris johnson ( now the country ’ s foreign secretary ) and nigel farage , the right-wing populist leader of the uk independence party – are similarly disparaged for recklessly jeopardizing the future of the uk and the eu alike .
if mainstream leaders want to change voters ’ minds , they should look carefully at what leadership really means .
here , it is worth recalling the insights of us general george c. marshall , who contemplated the topic as he worked to rebuild the us military in the 1940s .
marshall argued that leadership is a matter not of rhetoric , but of character .
in particular , leaders must display three key qualities to win the trust needed to lead effectively : purpose , impartiality , and competence .
purpose , in his view , meant putting the greater good ahead of one ’ s own interests .
a shining example is jo cox , the young british mp who was murdered during the brexit campaign , whose leadership in advocating for the rights of refugees was recognized across party lines .
but , in many cases , politics has become a matter of self-promotion – and a race for ratings .
in today ’ s celebrity culture , politicians must be “ personalities . ” they campaign like contestants on a reality tv show .
trump , with his clownish looks and showbiz resume , is probably the ultimate example of this shift .
( the huffington post even decided last summer to publish coverage of trump ’ s campaign in its entertainment section . )
the problem is not only that this can lead to the election of utterly unqualified leaders .
it is also that , once elected , even qualified leaders can struggle to shed the personal elements of their decision-making , and serve the country impartially instead .
the slippery slope is exposed in a memo – recently disclosed as part of the uk ’ s chilcot inquiry – written by former british prime minister tony blair to former us president george w. bush in the run-up to the iraq war .
the note begins , “ i will be with you , whatever . ” he was talking about leading his country into war .
yet his language suggests that his personal bond with bush somehow took precedence over his duty as prime minister .
leading with purpose , rather than personality , is closely related to the impartiality that marshall thought essential .
once in office , leaders must act with fairness and candor .
they must resist the temptation to use official power to benefit themselves , their families , or their cultural identity group , and refuse enticements , however powerful they may be , to offer special access or protection to friends , funders , and lobbyists .
maintaining a high standard of impartiality is not easy , but it is far from impossible .
president pedro pires of cape verde was awarded the 2011 ibrahim prize for achievement in african leadership , for transforming his country into “ a model of democracy , stability , and increased prosperity . ”
pires retired from office without even a house to his name ; he worked for the people , not to amass personal wealth .
the third criterion for good leadership – competence – is not just a matter of how much knowledge a leader already possesses .
as marshall noted , it also consists in leaders ’ capacity to learn from their mistakes and to prepare themselves and those around them for important decisions .
chilcot ’ s verdict on britain ’ s lack of preparation for the iraq war and its aftermath is damning in this regard .
so is the brexiteers ’ lack of any plan whatsoever for how to proceed after the referendum .
voters need to see candidates who show purpose , impartiality , and competence .
if they don ’ t , they will continue to vote against the establishment that they believe has failed them – even if it means voting for turmoil in europe or a reckless narcissist in the us .

why vote ?
as an australian citizen , i voted in the recent federal election there .
so did about 95 % of registered australian voters .
that figure contrasts markedly with elections in the united states , where the turnout in the 2004 presidential election barely exceeded 60 % .
in congressional elections that fall in the middle of a president ’ s term , usually fewer than 40 % of eligible americans bother to vote .
there is a reason why so many australians vote .
in the 1920 ’ s , when voter turnout fell below 60 % , parliament made voting compulsory .
since then , despite governments of varying political complexi@@ ons , there has been no serious attempt to repeal the law , which polls show is supported by about 70 % of the population .
those without an acceptable excuse , like illness or travel abroad , must pay a small fine , but the number fined is less than 1 % of eligible voters .
in practice , what is compulsory is not casting a valid vote , but going to the polling place , having one ’ s name checked off , and putting a ballot paper in the box .
the secrecy of the ballot makes it impossible to prevent people writing nonsense on their ballot papers or leaving them blank .
while the percentage of invalid votes is a little higher where voting is compulsory , it comes nowhere near offsetting the difference in voter turnout .
compulsory voting is not unique to australia .
belgium and argentina introduced it earlier , and it is practiced in many other countries , especially in latin america , although both sanctions and enforcement vary .
because i was in the us at the time of the australian election , i was under no compulsion to vote .
i had many reasons to hope for the defeat of john howard ’ s conservative government , but that doesn ’ t explain why i went to some trouble to vote , since the likelihood that my vote would make any difference was miniscule ( and , predictably , it did not ) .
when voting is voluntary , and the chance that the result will be determined by any single person ’ s vote is extremely low , even the smallest cost – for example , the time it takes to stroll down to the polling place , wait in line , and cast a ballot – is sufficient to make voting seem irrational .
yet if many people follow this line of reasoning , and do not vote , a minority of the population can determine a country ’ s future , leaving a discontented majority .
poland ’ s recent electoral history provides an example .
in the 2005 national elections , barely 40 % of those eligible voted , the lowest total since the advent of free elections after the communist period .
as a result , jaroslaw kaczynski was able to become prime minister with the support of a coalition of parties that gained a majority of seats in parliament , despite receiving only six million votes , out of a total of 30 million eligible voters .
when kaczynski was forced to go to the polls again only two years later , it became evident that many of those who had not voted in 2005 were unhappy with the outcome .
kaczynski ’ s government suffered a heavy defeat .
if we don ’ t want a small minority to determine our government , we will favor a high turnout .
yet since our own vote makes such a tiny contribution to the outcome , each of us still faces the temptation to get a free ride , not bothering to vote while hoping that enough other people will vote to keep democracy robust and to elect a government that is responsive to the views of a majority of citizens .
but there are many possible reasons for voting .
some people vote because they enjoy it , and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not .
others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not assess the rationality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one ’ s own ballot .
still others might vote not because they imagine that they will determine the outcome of the election , but because , like football fans , they want to cheer their team on .
they may vote because if they don ’ t , they will be in no position to complain if they don ’ t like the government that is elected .
or they may calculate that while the chances of their determining the outcome are only one in several million , the result is of such importance that even that tiny chance is enough to outweigh the minor inconveniences of voting .
if these considerations fail to get people to the polls , however , compulsory voting is one way of overcoming the free-rider problem .
the small cost imposed on not voting makes it rational for everyone to vote and at the same time establishes a social norm of voting .
australians want to be coerced into voting .
they are happy to vote , knowing that everyone else is voting , too .
countries worried about low voter turnout would do well to consider their compulsory model .

why wait for the euro ?
although the eu &apos;s eastward enlargement has not yet happened , the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow : when should the new , predominantly postcommunist , members adopt the euro ?
assuming that they comply with the maastricht treaty &apos;s provisions concerning the emu - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry .
at the outset , it must be stressed that , in seeking earlier entry into the emu a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if emu membership is delayed .
early entry , otherwise , would be an empty gesture .
i believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible , but preferable to delay .
by early adoption i mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism ( erm ii ) .
assuming entry into both the eu and erm ii in 2004 , new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006 .
is this realistic ?
well , most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the eu .
exports to the union have soared since 1991 , when the collapse of the soviet-era comecon trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the eu - towards western markets .
most accession candidates now send more exports to the eu than greece , portugal , and spain did when they entered the eu and emu .
progress on disinflation is similarly impressive .
annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5 % - not much higher than in many eu countries , and lower than in the netherlands last year .
as with structural convergence , eu candidates already outperform spain , portugal , and greece at a comparable time before their emu debut .
nor is there much risk of large , future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized .
theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the maastricht treaty allows .
the culprit in this pessimistic view is the so-called &quot; balassa-samuelson &quot; effect : rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates &apos; tradable sectors - export manufacturing , for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies , including in non-tradable sectors like services .
this overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average .
the balassa-samuelson effect is still evident in greece , spain and portugal .
but as empirical research prepared by the cec@@ 5 national banks estimates , its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-2 % .
with the balassa-samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation , the emu criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5 % of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the eu - is within reach .
but is early admission to emu preferable to postponing membership ?
from the standpoint of current member states , would admitting hungary , latvia , poland , or slovakia , sooner rather than later , drag down the euro as many fear ?
fears that extending emu to new states &quot; too soon &quot; would undermine the euro &apos;s external exchange rate are irrational .
if all candidate countries join the eu at around the same time , they will together account for a mere 6 % of its total gdp .
so any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to emu would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error .
delaying entry into emu could make sense if a longer wait produced more information .
but a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise .
equally , the transition period is already turbulent , with conver@@ gence-@@ driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries , including poland , the czech republic , and hungary .
indeed , capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under erm ii - a 15 % fluctuation band either side of a central parity .
some argue that erm ii membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves .
the benefit is simple : erm ii permits some exchange rate flexibility , as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro .
this would help keep the candidates &apos; economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average eu income levels .
this is an exceptionally weak argument , and a politically suspect one , too .
as european central bank data shows , average per capita gdp in the accession candidates is 44 % of the eurozone level .
the size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for eu and emu entry , probably lasting several decades .
more important , long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed ( emu ) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms .
a few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms .
in almost all candidates , further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation , more flexible labor markets , and completion of privatization .
delaying emu entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms .
any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that eu officials rightly hold dear .
early adoption , by contrast , would be more conducive to these reforms , and thus to real convergence .
success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency , reduced transaction costs , and a solid macroeconomic framework .
this strategy , not one of deferred entry , promises the most for both the eu &apos;s current and its future members .

the battle for water
new york – the sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle .
transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict , triggering a dam-building race and prompting growing calls for the united nations to recognize water as a key security concern .
water is different from other natural resources .
after all , there are substitutes for many resources , including oil , but none for water .
similarly , countries can import fossil fuels , mineral ores , and resources from the biosphere like fish and timber ; but they cannot import water , which is essentially local , on a large scale and on a prolonged – much less permanent – basis .
water is heavier than oil , making it very expensive to ship or transport across long distances even by pipeline ( which would require large , energy-intensive pumps ) .
the paradox of water is that it sustains life but can also cause death when it becomes a carrier of deadly microbes or takes the form of a tsunami , flash flood , storm , or hurricane .
many of the greatest natural disasters of our time – including , for example , the fukushima catastrophe in 2011 – have been water-related .
global warming is set to put po@@ tab@@ le-@@ water supplies under increasing strain – even as oceans rise and the intensity and frequency of storms and other extreme weather events increase .
rapid economic and demographic expansion has already turned adequate access to potable water into a major issue across large parts of the world .
lifestyle changes , for example , have spurred increasing per capita water consumption , with rising incomes promoting dietary change , for example , especially higher consumption of meat , production of which is ten times more water-intensive , on average , than plant-based calories and proteins .
today , the earth ’ s human population totals slightly more than seven billion , but the livestock population at any given time numbers more than 150 billion .
the direct ecological footprint of the livestock population is larger than that of the human population , with rapidly rising global meat consumption becoming a key driver of water stress by itself .
political and economic water wars are already being waged in several regions , reflected in dam construction on international rivers and coercive diplomacy or other means to prevent such works .
consider , for example , the silent water war triggered by ethiopia ’ s dam building on the blue nile , which has elicited egyptian threats of covert or overt military reprisals .
a report reflecting the joint judgment of us intelligence agencies warned last year that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism would become more likely in the next decade in some regions .
the interaction council , comprising more than 30 former heads of state or government , has called for urgent action to prevent some countries battling severe water shortages from becoming failed states .
the us state department , for its part , has upgraded water to “ a central us foreign policy concern . ”
in many countries , inadequate local water availability is increasingly constraining decisions about where to set up new manufacturing facilities and energy plants .
the world bank estimates that such constraints are costing china 2.3 % of gdp .
china , however , is not yet in the category of water-stressed states .
those that are , stretching from south korea and india to egypt and israel , are paying an even higher price for their water problems .
these countries already understand that water is a renewable but finite resource .
nature ’ s water-@@ replenishment capacity is fixed , limiting the world ’ s usable freshwater resources to about 200,000 cubic kilometers .
but the human population has almost doubled since 1970 , while the global economy has grown even faster .
major increases in water demand , however , are being driven not merely by economic and demographic growth , or by the additional energy , manufacturing , and food production to meet rising consumption levels , but also by the fact that the global population is getting fatter .
the average body mass index ( bmi ) of humans has been increasing in the post-world war ii period , but especially since the 1980 ’ s , with the prevalence of obesity doubling in the past three decades .
heavier citizens make heavier demands on natural resources , especially water and energy .
the issue thus is not just about how many mouths there are to feed , but also how much excess body fat there is on the planet .
for example , a study published in the british journal bmc public health has found that if the rest of the world had the same average body mass index as the us , this would be the equivalent of adding almost one billion people to the global population , greatly exacerbating water stress .
with the era of cheap , bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints , many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil .
the dramatic rise of the bottled-water industry since the 1990 ’ s attests to the increasing commodification of the world ’ s most critical resource .
not only are water shortages likely to intensify and spread , but consumers also will increasingly have to pay more for their water supply .
this double whammy can be mitigated only by innovative water management and conservation , and by developing nontraditional supply sources .
as in the oil and gas sector – where tapping unconventional sources , such as shale and tar sands , has proved a game changer – the water sector must adopt all unconventional options , including recycling wastewater and desal@@ inating ocean and brackish waters .
in short , we must focus on addressing our water-supply problems as if our lives depended on it .
in fact , they do .

the biology of luxury
paris – despite the global economic crisis , sales of luxury goods are surging worldwide .
why ?
while marketing has contributed to the rise , the luxury market ’ s robust growth is actually rooted in biology .
discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements : space , time , matter , and energy .
but recently , a fifth element , information , has entered the debate .
and information , it turns out , is crucial to understanding the fundamental drivers of luxury-goods consumption , and thus to predicting the luxury market ’ s future .
living organisms communicate , and the information that they exchange shapes their reality .
while animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength , humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health .
but , more than a symbol , buying luxury goods could indicate future success , owing to the selective advantage that showing off provides .
in nature , competitors perform , and the most compelling , beautiful spectacle wins .
for most animals , males are the performers .
male birds , for example , often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages , such as the australian ly@@ re@@ bird ’ s long tail .
as a result , competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate .
a bird that survives , despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators , must be fit , and will likely si@@ re a healthy progeny .
given that females bear the physical burden of offspring , an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature .
but humans are social creatures with no natural predators , so female competition is more widespread – and demonstrative performance and display are more likely .
indeed , while visual manifestations of wealth are prevalent for both genders , women ’ s appearance is frequently more vivid ( and more closely scrutinized ) .
but effective display is costly .
developing complex , vibrant plumage demands significant energy and genetic resources .
genes are difficult to maintain , requiring subtle and energy-intensive correcting processes .
just as writing too fast can cause typo@@ graphical errors that gar@@ ble a text , rapid changes to the genome can undermine a species ’ integrity .
likewise , purchasing luxury goods requires substantial financial resources .
this cost dictates the display ’ s competitive impact .
in today ’ s information-based world , selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price – and that price is known .
this is not the result of efficiency ( the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs ) .
rather , it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth .
cosmetics , like all luxury products , gain influence not from their production , or even their purchase , but from their visibility .
indeed , an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand .
for luxury goods to have any function , society needs information about their cost .
this has been true to varying degrees throughout history – sometimes resulting in price bubbles .
false information , such as counterfeit goods , jeopardizes the competi@@ tion-based selection process .
animals commonly use mimicry to capitalize on knowledge – or fear – of another ’ s strength .
by imitating an animal with a well-known protective profile , a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs .
but mimicry ’ s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz .
if there are too few of the original , the profile loses its significance , and its protective value vanishes .
similarly , nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common .
therefore , assessing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact , and thus their appeal , requires monitoring the extent of counterfeiting .
given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage , higher luxury-goods sales could indicate a brighter economic future for a country .
in a time of crisis , countries in which luxury goods play their selective role effectively are the safest bets for productive investment .

why we need “ game of thrones ”
paris – today ’ s popular television programs have become the equivalent of the feuilletons that began appearing in newspapers in the nineteenth century .
series like “ game of thrones ” and “ downton abbey , ” like balzac and dickens before them , serve as a source of entertainment and fodder for debate .
in this sense , our television screen@@ plays have emerged as key tools of social and political analysis .
such tools can be used to comprehend , for example , the difference between israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu and us president barack obama .
netanyahu is still stuck in the third season of “ homeland ” – that is , obsessed with iran – whereas obama , having begun to include the renewed russian threat in his strategic calculus , has already moved into the third season of “ house of cards . ”
of course , the availability of such comparisons is rooted in what often drives a tv series ’ popularity : its ability to hold up a mirror to a society – to reflect its anxieties and longings – and create a window through which outsiders can peer in .
consider “ downton abbey , ” a british period drama that follows the lives of the crawley family and its servants in the family ’ s classic country house , from 1912 to the mid-1920s .
why are millions of people worldwide – from europe to the united states to asia – so attracted to these characters ?
are they nostalgic for a time long past , which the show reconstitutes with exacting veri@@ simi@@ li@@ tude ?
or are they fascinated by the social dynamics that the show explores ?
for julian fellowes , who created the series , the explanation lies elsewhere – in our search for order in a chaotic world .
people feel so disoriented nowadays , he believes , that they are drawn to “ downton abbey ’ s ” tidy realm , in which the setting , clearly delineated in space and time , is governed by strict rules .
just as the crawley house serves as a kind of refuge for its characters , it may give its viewers a safe , predictable outlet by which to escape the tumultuous present – and avoid the unknown future .
similarly , the american political drama “ house of cards ” reflects a kind of disillusionment – this time , with us politics .
whereas “ the west wing , ” a popular political drama that ran from 1999 to 2006 , portrays the us presidency – held by a sophisticated , cultivated , and humanistic leader – with a kind of longing , “ house of cards ” immerses the viewer in a murky milieu of humanity ’ s worst impulses .
in “ house of cards , ” the world is not as viewers believe it should be , but as they fear it is .
this is the opposite of the approach taken by the danish political drama “ borgen , ” which presents an idealized prime minister , birgitte nyborg .
but the effect is similar .
one often hears people saying that the true problem facing denmark – and , in particular , its political class – is that prime minister helle thorning-schmidt lacks nyborg ’ s strengths .
by exposing the fundamental challenges and anxieties facing a society , a tv series can , at times , almost prefigure the future .
in retrospect , the series seems to have foreshadowed the tragedies that beset the country in january .
in particular , the fifth season , which aired in france in late 2014 , offered a clinical description of how young people in the paris suburbs went astray , while portraying the relationship between the police and their political superiors as cynical and even combative .
the show ’ s dialogue could have come straight out of a real-life parisian “ power lunch . ”
the tv show that has emerged as the most hotly debated of our time is , without a doubt , “ game of thrones , ” a medieval fantasy epic based ( increasingly loosely ) on george r.r. martin ’ s best-selling book series a song of ice and fire .
the series has become known not just for its massive budget or intricate storytelling , but also for its sustained chore@@ ography of brutal violence .
students of international politics , especially in canada and the us , wonder whether the show , by stressing the role of sheer brutality , encourages a “ realist ” vision of the world .
could the savagery featured on “ games of thrones ” – including abundant beheadings , rape , and sexual torture – have helped to encourage the tactics of , say , boko haram and the islamic state ?
or could the series – in which violence often begets more violence , but does not necessarily get the characters what they want – actually be highlighting the limits of force ?
on a more philosophical level , the show ’ s universe – a combination of ancient mythology and the middle ages – seems to capture the mixture of fascination and fear that many people nowadays feel .
it is a fantastic , unpredictable , and devastatingly painful world – one that is so complex that even the show ’ s most loyal viewers often are confused .
in this sense , it is much like the world in which we live .
though the west has no monopoly on the production of tv series , it undoubtedly dominates the field – and thus the worldview that such shows reflect .
given this , one might wonder whether chinese or russian leaders are making time in their busy schedules to watch series such as “ house of cards ” or “ games of thrones , ” in order to understand their rivals ’ mentality .
leading government advisers , at least , seem to recognize the value of tuning in .
a chinese friend recently told me that “ house of cards ” was very popular among china ’ s political elite .
they relish the reminder that politics is just as ruthless in the us as it is at home .

though much remains to be accomplished and consolidated , his achievements as leader of the international development community are noteworthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build .
perhaps wolfensohn ’ s most important contribution was to clarify the bank ’ s mission – to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world – while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the inadequacy of previous approaches .
at one time , it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries , merely supplying more capital would solve their problems .
indeed , this view provided part of the rationale for the world bank : if a shortage of funds was the problem , clearly a bank would have to be a key part of the solution .
in the 1980 ’ s , there was a switch from projects to policies – structural adjustments , involving trade liberalization , privatization , and macroeconomic stabilization ( typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output . )
but these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth ; the countries of east asia , which followed different policies , achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction .
under wolfensohn ’ s leadership , the bank began to look for multifaceted strategies , framed by what he called a comprehensive development framework .
many of the links were obvious , but had been given insufficient attention .
improved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if roads and harbors were lacking .
in a malaria-@@ infested country , mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage , as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable .
the returns from education , too , can be increased , if more individuals live longer because of better health care .
the bank began to recognize that developing countries differed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resources ; there was also a knowledge gap .
this was particularly important as the world moved into what we call the “ knowledge economy . ”
among the success stories were india and east asia , which invested heavily not just in primary education , but also in secondary and tertiary education , and especially in technology and science .
this represented a major change in the bank ’ s approach to education , which previously focused on primary schooling .
wolfensohn ’ s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking , a shift from downsizing the state to improving the state .
failed states , it was now acknowledged , were no less an impediment to development than were overbearing states .
the bank ’ s 1997 world development report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state , and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government .
under wolfensohn , the bank repeatedly stood up to the united states , where both the clinton and bush administrations might have preferred a more pliant president .
when then us deputy secretary of the treasury lawrence summers tried to change the bank ’ s decennial report on poverty – to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income – the bank prevailed .
when the us tried to suppress the bank ’ s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime – one more consonant with the interests of developing countries – the bank prevailed yet again .
both the bush administration and the eu would undoubtedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes , which have such adverse effects on developing countries .
it would have been helpful for bush if the world bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves , thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the bank ’ s lending capacity .
but it would have been wrong , and the bank again stood up for the interests of the developing world .
changing the relationship between the bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achievement .
in the past , the bank was seen as a purveyor of neoliberal orthodoxy – an approach to development whose credibility had weakened by the time wolfensohn arrived , and whose standing has eroded further since .
that orthodoxy often went hand in hand with the national , corporate , and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries , or so it was perceived .
worse , the bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance , an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies , thereby ener@@ v@@ ating their effectiveness .
when bank research showed that conditionality did not work , the bank under wolfensohn moved away from it .
the bank began to realize that on many key issues there were legitimate disagreements among economists about the right course of action .
democracy requires active debate about economic policies , not the suppression of discussion or the delegation of decision-making to experts , whether domestic or foreign .
the bank ’ s attempt to open the debate was not well received , by either the us treasury or the imf , but its influence was undeniable .
the fund , too , began to reduce conditionality , and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization , which previously had been central to its agenda .
gradually the bank came to be perceived , at least in many quarters , as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction , not an adversary attempting to promote a western economic agenda or ideology .
wolfensohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver ’ s seat , though not everyone within the bank was as enthusiastic about this ( or some of his other ) initiatives .
james wolfensohn presided over the world bank at a time of enormous change , tumult , and opportunity , an era marked by the end of the cold war , the postcommunist transition to market economies , and the east asian – and then global – financial crises .
his commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious .
he has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up .

why women still can ’ t ask the right questions
new york – we are just recovering , in the united states , from the entirely predictable kerfuffle over a pla@@ int published by anne-marie slaughter , former director of policy planning at the state department and a professor at princeton university , called “ why women still can ’ t have it all . ”
the response was predictable because slaughter ’ s article is one that is published in the us by a revolving cast of powerful ( most often white ) women every three years or so .
the article , whoever has written it , always bemoans the “ myth ” of a work-life balance for women who work outside the home , presents the glass ceiling and work-family exhaustion as a personal revelation , and blames “ feminism ” for holding out this elusive “ hav@@ ing-@@ it-all ideal . ”
and it always manages to evade the major policy elephants in the room – which is especially ironic in this case , as slaughter was worn out by crafting policy .
the problems with such arguments are many .
for starters , the work-family balance is no longer a women ’ s issue .
all over the developed world , millions of working men with small children also regret the hours that they spend away from them , and go home to bear the brunt of shared domestic tasks .
this was a “ women ’ s issue ” 15 years ago , perhaps , but now it is an ambient tension of modern life for a generation of women and men who are committed to gender equality .
such arguments also ignore the fact that affluent working women and their partners overwhelmingly offload the work-family imbalance onto lower-income women – overwhelmingly women of color .
one can address how to be an ethical , sustainable employer of such caregivers ; nannies in new york and other cities are now organizing to secure a system of market-@@ pegged wages , vacation time , and sick days .
or , as so often happens in a racist society , one can paint the women who care for the elite ’ s children out of the picture altogether .
moreover , an inflexible and family-@@ unfriendly corporate environment is no longer the only choice for working women .
many , particularly in the us , have left that world to start their own businesses .
most importantly , americans have a remarkable tendency to reduce problems that others addressed through public policy to a matter of private “ choice ” and even personal psychology .
but the real question is not whether “ women can have it all . ”
rather , it is how a sophisticated foreign-policy professional can write as if countries like canada and the netherlands simply did not exist .
in canada , couples with a baby may sequence six-month leaves of absence at up to 90 % pay .
in the netherlands – the best scenario i have seen yet – families can take a day off each week , and the government subsidizes full-time daycare .
this solution was not framed as a “ women ’ s issue , ” but as a family benefit .
and dutch women have simply moved on , focusing on other interesting goals in their personal and family lives .
in america , by contrast , the chamber of commerce and other business interests lobby hard to keep politicians from ever proposing such solutions .
they know that billions of dollars are made from hiring women at lower income levels than men , and then ensuring that a work-family conflict derails women ’ s careers before they become too expensive to compensate fairly .
of course , europe is not gender-equality nirvana .
in particular , the corporate workplace will never be completely family-friendly until women are part of senior management decisions , and europe ’ s top corporate-governance positions remain overwhelmingly male .
indeed , women hold only 14 % of positions on european corporate boards .
the european union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women – up to 60 % .
this proposed mandate was born of frustration .
last year , european commission vice president viviane reding issued a call to voluntary action .
reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40 % female board membership .
the forte foundation in america has now followed suit with its own list of “ board-@@ ready women . ”
but reding ’ s appeal in europe was considered a failure : only 24 companies took it up .
do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate ladder fairly as they balance work and family ?
“ personally , i don ’ t like quotas , ” reding said recently .
“ but i like what the quotas do . ”
quotas get action : they “ open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling , ” according to reding , a result seen in france and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions .
i understand reding ’ s reticence – and her frustration .
i don ’ t like quotas either ; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy .
but , when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal , it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily mandated .
after all , four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in europe as well as the us are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions – no matter how much “ soft pressure ” is put upon them .
when women do break through to the summit of corporate power – as , for example , sheryl sandberg recently did at facebook – they garner massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule .
if appropriate public policies were in place to help all women – whether ceos or their children ’ s caregivers – and all families , sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society .
and laments like slaughter ’ s would not be necessary .

wikileaks , secrets , and lies
singapore – the latest information dump from wikileaks offers fascinating insights into the workings of the us state department that will keep foreign policy wonks and conspiracy theorists busy for months .
much of what has been reported is not “ news ” in the traditional sense , of course , but a series of embarrassing gaffes : truths that were never meant to be said aloud .
underlying these various , and often banal , tid@@ bits of information – it should be no surprise that americans found italian prime minister silvio berlusconi “ vain , ” or regarded zimbabwe ’ s robert mugabe as a “ crazy old man ” – is the larger question of whether governments should be able to keep secrets .
wikileaks founder julian assange argues that the answer is no , and that greater transparency “ creates a better society for all people . ”
this raises the question of why governments keep secrets at all , and whether those reasons are justified .
the task of keeping a state ’ s secrets frequently falls to its intelligence services , which tend to focus on the protection of three types of information .
the first type is their own sources and methods , which need to be safeguarded if they are to remain effective when gathering data .
when the washington times reported in 1998 that the national security agency was able to monitor osama bin laden ’ s satellite phone , for example , he stopped using it .
second , the identities and activities of a service ’ s operational staff should be withheld , so that they can do their jobs and to ensure their safety .
following wikileaks ’ release in july of tens of thousands of documents on the afghan war , a taliban spokesman told british journalists that the group was “ studying the report ” with a view to identifying and punishing anyone found to have collaborated with us forces .
third , information provided in confidence by foreign governments or intelligence services must be closely held to avoid embarrassing the provider of the information and thereby reducing the likelihood that information will be shared in future .
a lasting consequence of the most recent leak is circumspection when sharing intelligence with the united states .
in reality , of course , governments typically attempt to keep much more than this secret .
avoiding embarrassment may at times be in the national interest , but it can also protect the careers of politicians and bureaucrats . in other circumstances , it may be prudent to avoid revealing how much – or how little – is known about a given situation .
wikileaks sees itself as part of the tradition in which the media hold governments accountable for abuse .
the role of the fourth estate was particularly important during the administration of president george w bush .
revelations of torture , extraordinary rendition , and warrantless electronic surveillance all depended on investigative journalism of a kind that is now threatened by budget cuts and the media ’ s relentless focus on whatever is current – often at the expense of what is genuinely newsworthy .
but , whereas true investigative journalism depends on quality , wikileaks distinguishes itself by quantity .
the sheer volume of the data being dumped on the internet makes it impossible for thorough analysis or , indeed , for thorough examination of potentially damaging information .
the threshold for exposure is no longer wrongdoing of the scale that coined the term “ watergate ” and all the subsequent “ -@@ gates . ”
instead , government officials are being warned that every document may potentially be leaked and published worldwide by a disgruntled junior officer .
the consequence is unlikely to be transparency .
perversely , it will lead to greater secrecy .
the message that is almost certainly going through every major power is : be careful what you commit to writing .
in place of candid assessments and provocative analysis , many important decisions will now be based on oral briefings and meetings that are not recorded in minutes .
decision-makers will be wary of openness even with their closest staff .
these changes are likely to outlast us secretary of state hillary clinton ’ s embarrassment .
such self-censorship will lead to worse decisions and less accountability for the decisions that are made .
it seems a high price to pay for gossip .

wikileak@@ y power
paris – beyond the headlines , the embarrassment of governments , and the blow dealt to the secrecy of diplomatic correspondence , wikileaks ’ exposure of us diplomatic cables offers a raw illustration of how deeply the essence of power has been altered in our information age .
since its inception , the state has been the main vessel of power ; access to power usually meant control of the state , whether by election or by violent takeover .
this model , within which individuals are subjects or , at best , taxpayers and voters , is being undermined by several recent trends that have empowered the individual .
consider the internet , a network of connected nodes invented in the 1960 ’ s , at the height of the cold war , to preserve the united states from total chaos after a nuclear attack on its nerve centers .
it was deliberately constructed with no hierarchy , no core , and no central authority , though few at the time could have suspected where , given the numerous breakthroughs of the digital revolution , the internet ’ s built-in trend toward decentralized power would lead .
it has led to the second trend : a metamorphosis of the production process .
information has become much more than a message conveyed by technology ; it is now the raw material of services-@@ intensive advanced economies , and the building block of modern social and productive organizations .
the third trend concerns the room this has opened for individual and collective action .
in the human condition , the philosopher hannah arendt linked politics to the human capacity not simply to act , but to “ act in concert . ”
while concerted action is a familiar notion , it used to be aimed mainly at influencing the state – exemplified by the way civil society prompted america ’ s withdrawal from vietnam .
today , however , collective action is of a different magnitude .
because of the universality of the digital language , its ease of use , and the virtual absence of marginal costs for producing or disseminating information , the state ’ s tools of control have been weakened and depleted .
global finance has been one of the most eager beneficiaries of these trends , using internet networks not just as a tool to conduct operations with greater efficiency and velocity , but also as a means to circumvent state supervision .
corporations have dwelled on connectivity to globalize their markets , r &amp; d , ownership , tax domici@@ liation , and leadership , thoroughly transforming their relationship with states , whether in their country of origin or elsewhere .
in september 1992 , it took george soros $ 10 billion to bring the bank of england to its knees and impose devaluation on the pound .
it now takes only a computer and internet connection to cause serious trouble : intrusion by hackers into protected networks , or the introduction of havo@@ c-@@ wreaking software viruses and worms in sensitive information systems .
while the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 – the deadliest of all time – had nothing “ virtual ” about them , their perpetrator , al-qaeda , projects a cloud of threat and power by using cyberspace to promote its bloody “ successes , ” spread hatred , and recruit jihadists .
of course , access to a networked world has also balanced state power in positive ways , by giving a formidable boost to independent advocacy , as seen in the online campaign to ban landmines and the treaty that ratified its success – despite opposition by powerful states .
many similar organizations have flourished , gaining the ability to shape political outcomes and public policies .
but there is no place where the transformative power of connectivity is potentially greater than in china , with its reported 420 million internet users .
no matter how eager china ’ s authorities are to keep the internet under their control – for example , by blocking foreign web sites – they are also aware of how much their economy now needs the internet .
as a result , the room for “ concerted action ” has never been so large for individual chinese to gain access to uncensored information , share opinions , and communicate country-wide to expose official misconduct .
the nobel peace prize laureate liu xiaobo was jailed for circulating on the internet his proposal for a truly democratic constitution , charter 08 , which gathered 10,000 signatures online in only 24 hours .
in the late 1980 ’ s , glasnost – transparency – was one of the nails in the coffin of the soviet union .
while wikileaks has certainly not had a similar effect , it epitomizes the extent of the individual ’ s empowerment in a networked world .
all that was necessary to challenge the world ’ s mightiest power , after all , was a disgruntled us army intelligence analyst , some hacking knowledge , a few computers , and a handful of determined activists enrolled under the contested banner of transparency .
this drive prompted us secretary of state hillary clinton in january 2010 to proclaim the “ freedom to connect ” as the cyber-@@ equivalent of the more familiar freedoms of assembly or expression .
of course , clinton added , these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing , and can be misused for darker purposes .
but her list of the potential abuses of the connected world contained nothing similar to the wikileaks storm .
that storm will leave behind no trace of understanding if it is assessed in isolation , rather than as part of a broader pattern .
wikileaks ’ latest release demonstrates that the transformation of power by the “ digital revolution ” could be as far-reaching as that brought about by the fifteenth-century printing revolution .
in this game , where new players invite themselves , the edge goes to agility and innovation .
all of this implies that connectedness will remain a double-edged sword – the leverage it provides being fraught with vulnerability .
and that means that we can count on more surprises in store for states .

wild about risk
most people do not feel the same impulse to go out and buy insurance , or diversify their investments , as they do to buy a sofa or new clothes .
they should , but they don &apos;t .
insurance , investment , and banking institutions have historically had to fight an uphill battle to get individuals , businesses , and government to pay for risk management .
their successes , while impressive , remain incomplete : people still have difficulty facing the inherent risks and uncertainties about their economic future .
this is why almost every advanced country has mandatory social security and health insurance programs .
of course , people are not really unaware of life &apos;s big risks .
we simply ignore them for reasons that are rooted in human psychology .
the link between intellectual recognition of risks and the impetus to act against them is mediated by fear : we have been programmed over millions of years of evolution to take decisive action against immediate and obvious threats .
if a menacing wild animal approaches , we feel fear and anxiety .
adrenaline flows , our attention is focussed , and our instinct to protect friends and family aroused .
but more remote risks simply do not stimulate our emotions , so we often postpone taking action indefinitely .
we are also more afraid of well-publicized risks - especially those that can kill us in grisly ways .
after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the us , many americans drove to distant locations rather than fly , even though statistics showed that flying remained far safer .
meanwhile , many of these same people were probably among the millions of americans who didn &apos;t get an annual medical check-up .
measuring risks , especially important long-term ones , is imprecise and difficult .
virtually none of the economic statistics reported in the media measure risk .
to fully comprehend risk , we must stretch our imagination to think of all the different ways that things can go wrong , including things that have not happened in recent memory .
we must protect ourselves against fallacies , such as thinking that just because a risk has not proved damaging for decades , it no longer exists .
yet another psychological barrier is a sort of ego involvement in our own success .
our tendency to take full credit for our successes discourages us from facing up to the possibility of loss or failure , because considering such prospects calls into question our self-satisfaction .
indeed , self-esteem is one of the most powerful human needs : a view of our own success relative to others provides us with a sense of meaning and well-being .
so accepting the essential randomness of life is terribly difficult , and contradicts our deep psychological need for order and accountability .
we often do not protect the things that we have - such as our opportunities to earn income and accumulate wealth - because we mistakenly believe that our own natural superiority will do that for us .
this tendency is especially apparent when it comes to public policy .
government leaders find it hard to address economic risks to the nation because it is impolitic to call into question the self-esteem of their constituency .
but no one who looks at the matter seriously can argue that the tremendous inequality between the world &apos;s nations reflects fundamental differences in inherent ability or immutable character .
the per capita gdp of india in 2000 , for example , was only 7 % of that of the us .
can anyone believe that this is because americans are 14 times smarter or 14 times better in character than indians ?
obviously , these two countries &apos; relative positions are due to circumstances that can be changed , or that will change in response to economic events and political decisions .
but the leaders of the world &apos;s rich countries have great difficulty addressing risks to their relative success vis-à-vis less developed countries , because national self-esteem is too tied up with it .
citizens in advanced countries just can &apos;t believe - and don &apos;t want to be told - that their privileged status may be dissipated unless proper steps are taken to insure against the risks they face .
for example , the world &apos;s advanced countries are scarcely less dependent on oil today than they were in 1973 , when the opec embargo stifled their economies and sent prices soaring .
most companies are no better at managing or even recognizing the different kinds of economic risks that their workers face .
many maintain insurance and pensions for their employees , but also encourage their workers to trust the company to provide for them forever , and even to invest in the company &apos;s stock .
when an employee is laid off in middle age , or the company goes bankrupt , the suddenly materialized risk may come as a shock .
clearly , establishing mandatory social security and health insurance programs , and a social safety net for the poor , has helped hedge the most fundamental risks that people face .
the problem is the lack of any coherent policy for ensuring that individuals are protected against a broader array of economic risks to their incomes , investments , and homes .
so new risk management institutions need to be devised .
they should use markets , rather than state guarantees , and while they should not be mandatory , they must be designed in accordance with humans &apos; psychological limitations , so that people will use them .
we know enough about risk perception to recognize that helping people cope with the risks of modern life requires addressing their hearts as well as their heads .

a virtuous cycle for conservation
new york – poor and rural people around the world rely on plants and animals for shelter , food , income , and medicine .
in fact , the united nations sustainable development goal ( sdg 15 ) on sustainable ecosystems acknowledges many developing societies ’ close relationship with nature when it calls for increased “ capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities . ”
but how is this to be achieved ?
the 1975 convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) provides a viable framework for reducing poverty while also conserving nature .
it regulates the harvesting and exchange of more than 35,000 wildlife species across a range of locales .
nature has been described as the “ gdp of the poor . ”
the cites framework , combined with strong national conservation policies , can simultaneously protect wild species and benefit poor , rural , and indigenous people , by encouraging countries and communities to adopt sound environmental management plans .
for example , under cites , andes communities she@@ ar the vicuña for its fine wool , which they sell to the luxury fashion industry in other parts of the world .
camer@@ ooni@@ ans collect african cherry bark for export to european pharmaceutical companies .
and people on the tibetan plateau in bhutan make a living selling caterpillar fungus to the traditional-@@ medicine industry .
however , outside of cites , limited guidance is available to ensure that legal trade is sustainable and beneficial to the poor .
sustainable trade often depends on poor and rural communities conserving their own resources at the local level .
to see what that looks like , the international trade center ( itc ) recently examined how people in southeast asia sustainably manage the cites-@@ listed python trade .
python skins are commonly used as raw material in the luxury fashion industry , and itc surveys of python-skin harv@@ esters , farmers , processors , and exporters in vietnam and malaysia found that the trade reinforces livelihood resilience by providing an additional source of income .
in vietnam , an estimated 1,000 households farm and trade pythons , and python harvesting in malaysia provides incomes for low-skilled , low-income workers during periods when other employment opportunities are either out of season , or simply scarce because of larger economic factors .
researchers found that most of those harvesting pythons implement simple and effective sustainable-@@ management plans , and that this has reduced pressure on wild populations .
however , python skins , like many wildlife products , are a commodity , so communities harvesting them are limited in terms of how they can add value to increase returns .
women in the peruvian andes may clean vicuña wool by hand to increase the price it fetches per kilogram by $ 50 , whereas selling a wo@@ ol-@@ scar@@ f could yield them $ 150-200 ; a malaysian python skin sells for $ 200 , while a python-skin bag could sell for $ 2,000 .
still , some emerging countries are moving up the value chain and retaining a greater share of returns , as demonstrated by local brands such as kuna , which markets al@@ paca and vicuña wool in peru , and natura , a brazilian natural-@@ cosmetic brand .
the biggest threats to the legal wildlife trade are poaching , smuggling , improper trade permitting , and animal abuse , all of which must be addressed by regulators and rural community stakeholders at the local level .
fortunately , rural communities are already in the best position to protect wildlife , so long as they are motivated to do so .
in the right circumstances , a virtuous cycle , whereby local producers have a direct interest in protecting wildlife ( because they are benefiting from its legal trade ) is the best – and sometimes the only – long-term solution to the problem of sustainability .
to help with this , governments can increase rural communities ’ resource- and wildlife-@@ use rights so that they can manage and protect their natural resources sustainably .
for example , in the 1970s when peru granted andean communities the right to use vicuña wool , it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new , long-term income streams for the community .
because legal and natural circumstances vary by country and community , we will need similar policy innovations across different sectors .
one promising sector is tourism , which also fits into the cites framework .
to take one example , since rwanda began sharing wildlife-@@ tourism revenues with local communities , the mountain-@@ gorilla population has grown .
as we see time and again , when local communities are included , they can become resolute wildlife defenders .
more generally , we should be supporting scientists working on new adap@@ tive-@@ management methods , and the private sector should be given incentives to invest in greater sustainable sourcing and increased supply- and production-@@ chain transparency .
as the examples above show , conservation and improved livelihoods for the rural poor are feasible , and even mutually reinforcing .
with more political will and smart investments , there is no reason we can ’ t reach the sdgs to both reduce poverty and safeguard wildlife for future generations .
last year , the un passed an historic resolution to tackle illicit wildlife trafficking , recognizing the effectiveness of the cites legal framework .
the resolution calls on the 182 cites member countries to protect the interests of wildlife as well as to provide tangible benefits for the poor and rural communities .
we hope that delegates from those member countries meeting at the world wildlife conference in south africa are hearing that call .

new york – in their efforts to pass a bailout plan for america ’ s financial system , bush administration officials invoked the specter of the great depression of the 1930 ’ s .
but , for most asians , economic armageddon is far more recent .
the asian financial crisis of a decade ago brought banks , corporations and governments to their knees .
the bonfire was sparked by the collapse of the thai baht in the summer of 1997 .
contagion soon spread across east asia , with the ripple effects of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as russia and brazil .
the long-running “ economic miracles ” of south korea and hong kong ended , as did surging growth in indonesia and thailand .
the central lesson taken from that crisis was to maintain large foreign-exchange reserves .
this became a virtual article of faith among east asian governments .
back in the 1990 ’ s , asia ’ s fast-growing economies maintained small reserves , despite booming exports and foreign investment .
once the tailspin began in 1997 , governments ’ lack of reserves hampered their ability to rescue failed banks , forcing them to appeal to international institutions for relief .
but the international monetary fund ’ s bailout came with strings attached , including demands for more of the rapid capital market liberalization that induced the crisis in the first place .
indeed , what the west calls the “ asian financial crisis ” is known in asia as the “ imf crisis . ”
the political humiliation and economic frustration of dealing with imf imperatives confirmed the central importance of maintaining large reserves , as an issue not just of currency stability , but also economic sovereignty .
one asian economy emerged from the 1997-1998 crisis relatively unscathed : china .
there were many reasons for this , but foremost among them was that china had already amassed more than $ 100 billion in reserves , and refused to revalue its currency , when the crisis hit .
since then , china has aggressively pursued a fast-growth , export , and investment heavy model of economic development .
by capping the exchange rate and producing far more than it consumes , china ’ s reserves grew into a leviathan , hitting the $ 1 trillion mark in 2005 .
even after china ( under pressure from us treasury officials ) let the yuan partially float in 2005 , the leviathan kept growing by about $ 200 billion annually .
over the past year and a half , china ’ s reserves skyrocketed to $ 1.8 trillion , far and away the world ’ s largest .
the chinese state probably hasn ’ t sat on so much lu@@ c@@ re since the halcyon days of the qing empire , when insatiable european demand for porcelain , tea and silk flooded the central coffers in beijing with silver bullion .
but the paradox is that today ’ s reserves are not real wealth that can be pumped back into the domestic economy .
instead , china ’ s reserves mostly underwrite america ’ s debt .
even before wall street hit the skids , there was growing consensus in china that its reserves had grown far beyond what was necessary to avert another 1997-@@ style crisis .
calls for a more diversified investment strategy intensified .
investing in us treasuries , after all , was a sure loss-@@ maker , given the gap between their modest yield and the steady appreciation of the yuan .
with the creation one year ago of a $ 200 billion sovereign wealth fund , the china investment corporation , beijing positioned itself for more equity investment ( although its early investments , in the blackstone group and morgan stanley , were widely criticized ) .
economist andy xie , formerly with morgan stanley , proposed last week that china trade its dollar assets for shares in us companies on a grand scale , challenging america to overcome its financial xenophobia in order to avert a disaster of undercapitalization .
but many in china , from nationalist bloggers to social justice activists , advance a deeper critique of the leviathan reserve .
why bind up chinese capital to finance america ’ s debt-@@ consumption economy , they ask , when so many needs go unmet at home ?
china was one of the world ’ s most egalitarian societies as late as 1985 .
today , it suffers one of the world ’ s biggest gaps between haves and have-nots .
chinese-style capitalism is flaunting its defiance of one confucius ’ basic teachings — don ’ t worry about poverty , he warned , worry about inequality .
china ’ s physical infrastructure in booming central cities is undergoing radical modernization , but the social and environmental infrastructure is falling apart , especially in the interior and for the huge rural population .
for years , the central government has talked about creating “ social harmony ” — with a “ new-@@ type rural cooperative medical services system , ” by increasing spending on education to 4 % of gdp and eliminating school fees , and implementing “ sustainable development ” models .
the promises are grand , but the actions have not measured up .
and the economic costs of restricted access to healthcare and education , on top of the scarcity of clear air and potable water , will be crippling in the mid- and long-term .
the challenge for china in the years to come is to divest itself of american debt , and begin investing in the health , education and environmental well-being of its own people .
growing the economy at an average annual rate of 10 % , it turns out , may have been the easy part .

will banks and financial markets recover in 2009 ?
new york – global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the great depression of the 1930 ’ s .
major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts .
global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed ; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and many emerging-market economies staggered to the international monetary fund for help .
so what lies ahead in 2009 ?
is the worst behind us or ahead of us ?
to answer these questions , we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contraction and worsening financial conditions is underway .
the united states will certainly experience its worst recession in decades , a deep and protracted contraction lasting about 24 months through the end of 2009 .
moreover , the entire global economy will contract .
there will be recession in the euro zone , the united kingdom , continental europe , canada , japan , and the other advanced economies .
there is also a risk of a hard landing for emerging-market economies , as trade , financial , and currency links transmit real and financial shocks to them .
in the advanced economies , recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970 ’ s-style stagflation ( a combination of economic stagnation and inflation ) .
but , with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply , slack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms ’ pricing power is restrained .
likewise , rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth .
these factors , combined with sharply falling commodity prices , will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1 % level , raising concerns about deflation , not stagflation .
deflation is dangerous as it leads to a liquidity trap : nominal policy rates cannot fall below zero , so monetary policy becomes ineffective .
falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nominal debts rise , leading to further declines in consumption and investment – and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squeezed further , aggravating the fall in demand and prices .
as traditional monetary policy becomes ineffective , other unorthodox policies will continue to be used : policies to bail out investors , financial institutions , and borrowers ; massive provision of liquidity to banks in order to ease the credit crunch ; and even more radical actions to reduce long-term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds .
today ’ s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the us housing bubble , but it was not caused by it .
america ’ s credit excesses were in residential mortgages , commercial mortgages , credit cards , auto loans , and student loans .
there was also excess in the securitized products that converted these debts into toxic financial derivatives ; in borrowing by local governments ; in financing for leveraged buyouts that should never have occurred ; in corporate bonds that will now suffer massive losses in a surge of defaults ; in the dangerous and unregulated credit default swap market .
moreover , these pathologies were not confined to the us .
there were housing bubbles in many other countries , fueled by excessive cheap lending that did not reflect underlying risks .
there was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and hedge funds bubble .
indeed , we now see the demise of the shadow banking system , the complex of non-bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they borrowed short term and in liquid ways , leveraged a lot , and invested in longer term and illiquid ways .
as a result , the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust , with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $ 2 trillion .
thus , unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions , the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending .
equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007 , but there are still significant downside risks .
an emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets – including equities – have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur .
but the worst is still ahead of us .
in the next few months , the macroeconomic news and earnings / profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected , putting further downward pressure on prices of risky assets , because equity analysts are still deluding themselves that the economic contraction will be mild and short .
while the risk of a total systemic financial meltdown has been reduced by the actions of the g-7 and other economies to backstop their financial systems , severe vulnerabilities remain .
the credit crunch will get worse ; deleveraging will continue , as hedge funds and other leveraged players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets , thus causing more price falls and driving more insolvent financial institutions out of business .
a few emerging-market economies will certainly enter a full-blown financial crisis .
so 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stresses , losses , and bankruptcies .
only aggressive , coordinated , and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging-market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010 , rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation .

europe ’ s unending berlusconi problem
he may not wish to be king again , but he certainly can be a kingmaker , owing to his control of mediaset , italy ’ s largest media group .
and , given his abysmal popularity ratings , he may decide to play the wild card , embrace a euro-skeptic and anti-government stance , and try to bring down prime minister mario monti ’ s technocratic administration .
monti ’ s government took over from berlusconi in november 2011 , arriving with a clear mandate , and full parliamentary support , to implement the measures needed to restore market confidence and reassure italy ’ s eurozone partners and the international monetary fund that the country was not going down the path taken by greece .
at the time of the g-20 summit in cannes that month , italy – and europe – was dangerously close to collapse , with berlusconi ’ s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country ’ s debt-service costs .
domestic political deadlock , and berlusconi ’ s inability to engage with germany and france resulted in spiraling refinancing costs , with the spread relative to german bunds consistently over 500 basis points between july and november 2011 .
the monti government has restored market confidence and italy ’ s international credibility .
but the overall picture remains fragile .
the interest-rate spread has stabilized around a more manageable 300 basis points , but is still higher than it was three years ago .
in addition , italy ’ s economic outlook remains highly uncertain .
indeed , the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be eluding italy .
according to the imf , the economy will remain in recession next year , and , though the rate of contraction will be less severe than in 2012 ( -0.7 % in 2013 , compared to -2.3 % this year ) , the unemployment rate is expected to rise further , from 10.6 % to 11.1 % .
more needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short term , improve the country ’ s fiscal position in the medium term , and implement the structural reforms needed to make the italian economy more robust and internationally competitive in the long term .
italy is ranked 43rd in the world economic forum ’ s global competitiveness index , well below the main eurozone countries , owing to lack of investment – especially in human capital – and structural rigidities that have constrained growth for many years .
the answer to italy ’ s economic problems is not , as berlusconi advocates , an exit from the eurozone and a return to the flexibility of its own currency , which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competitiveness through irresponsible devaluations .
italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the eurozone , which means adopting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innovation , not currency devaluation , are the main drivers of competitiveness .
a stable , competent , and responsible government with a comfortable parliamentary majority is essential to continue what monti ’ s government has initiated .
while the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition , many uncertainties could derail the reform process .
in particular , whether italy will be able to move beyond technocratic politics to a “ normal ” government remains the outstanding question both at home and for the other eurozone member states .
from this perspective , what berlusconi advocates for italy , and the consequences of his agenda for the eurozone , is not good news .
any hint that the country may be locked again in parliamentary inertia , as in the final months of berlusconi ’ s last government , would push the markets to question the credibility of italy ’ s fiscal-consolidation plan , jeopardizing the country ’ s ability to refinance its debt .
that debt is the largest in the eurozone – at roughly € 2 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion ) , or 120 % of the country ’ s gdp – which means that italy can be helped , but not rescued .
with potential instability looming , monti should ensure that italy is not defenseless in the event of another round of market instability .
unlike some months ago , now the european central bank can intervene and buy troubled countries ’ debt .
but this mechanism can be activated only by formal request .
italy should follow this route without delay .
it is better to have a powerful weapon that may gather dust than to be unarmed in a time of need .

will britain choose irrelevance ?
london – when voters in the united kingdom go to the polls on june 23 to decide whether their country should leave the european union , the issues they will have to reckon with will include the impact of their decision on unemployment , trade flows , and the stability of financial markets .
but there are other less quantifiable considerations that must also be weighed in the balance .
the economic arguments against a british exit from the eu – or brexit – have been well rehearsed .
many have suggested that if the uk were to leave , manufacturers would secure continued access to the european market by fleeing across the english channel , costing the country millions of jobs .
similarly , withdrawal from the eu risks undermining london ’ s position as a global financial center , which depends on the city ’ s integration into european markets .
another area of concern for many voters regards the uk ’ s sovereignty – the idea that independent countries should have ultimate decision-making authority over what happens within their borders .
membership in the eu sometimes requires ceding control to a complex web of often-@@ inefficient brussels-based supranational institutions .
i hold a doctorate in economics and work with businesses whose employees and operations benefit from the uk ’ s membership in the eu .
i also have a pronounced disdain for red tape and inefficiency .
and yet i do not believe that economic considerations or concerns about sovereignty offer compelling arguments for brexit .
much more important is the potential impact of such a decision on the uk ’ s global standing .
membership in a european community of 500 million people provides the uk with considerable influence over geopolitics and the global economy .
as the world becomes ever more daunting and complex , maintaining that influence is clearly in the country ’ s interest .
the referendum campaign is playing out against a global economic and political backdrop that is nothing if not foreboding .
the international monetary fund has warned that global growth is unlikely to return to the levels that it attained before the 2008 financial crisis .
indeed , the global consulting firm mckinsey predicts that global growth rates during the next 50 years will be half of what they were over the previous five decades .
meanwhile , martin dempsey , a retired army general and former chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff , has said that the world has entered the most dangerous period he has ever witnessed .
developing countries are home to roughly 90 % of the world ’ s population , and some two-thirds of their residents are younger than 25 .
stagnant growth or shrinking output in many emerging economies has serious consequences .
the uk ’ s overseas development institute predicts that by 2025 , roughly 80 % of the world ’ s poor will live in fragile states .
job-@@ eroding technological advances , worsening income inequality , demographic shifts , dwindling natural resources , and environmental depletion are adding even more straws to the camel ’ s back .
the world is already undergoing the worst refugee crisis since the end of world war ii , with some 60 million people having been driven from their homes .
the mounting instability will only exacerbate the problem .
leaving the eu will not shield the uk from the vagaries of the global economy .
it will only deprive the country of a leading voice in shaping the response to new and existing challenges .
the uk is far better placed to influence the global policy agenda from inside the eu than from outside it .
to be sure , leaving the eu would not strip the uk of its historical prominence in international organizations – most notably its permanent membership of the united nations ’ security council .
but a non-european britain would be less likely to secure the same standing and influence in whatever institutions emerge in the years ahead .
within the eu , the uk is a critical part of an influential economic and political bloc with undeniable heft .
amplified by the eu , its voice can influence world events , providing the country with what the british like to describe as an ability to punch above its weight .
should the uk leave , however , its influence would be limited to its true size on the global stage : a relatively small country with limited economic and political power .
as british voters prepare to cast their ballots , they should weigh carefully the consequences of international irrelevance .

will cancun promote or undermine development ?
from september 10-14 , trade ministers from around the world will meet for the next stage of what is supposed to be the development round of trade talks .
at their last meeting in doha in november 2001 , ministers recognized the inequities of the previous round of trade negotiations , the uruguay round .
this round was supposed to redress those imbalances .
one would have thought that the developing countries would look forward to the meeting as a chance to achieve a fairer global trading system .
instead , many fear that what has happened in the past will happen again : secret negotiations , arm twisting , and the display of brute economic power by the us and europe--and by special interests in the advanced countries--@@ aimed at ensuring that the interests of the rich are protected .
while some progress has been made in making the negotiations more open and transparent , efforts to go further have met with resistance , and for good reason : unbalanced processes help ensure unbalanced outcomes .
ironically , the world trade organization , where each country has one vote , might seem far more ``democratic &apos; &apos; than , say , the imf , where a single country , the us , has a veto .
yet the realpolitik of economic power has ensured that the interests of the developed countries predominate .
here is a short checklist against which to assess whether the outcomes of cancun represent a move towards a true development round .
· agriculture .
most people in the developing world live in the rural sector , which is why free and fair trade in agriculture matters .
it &apos;s not just a question of providing access , but of eliminating the subsidies that encourage production in rich countries and harm farmers in poor countries .
although both europe and america accuse each other of unfair agricultural policies , neither side seems willing to make major concessions .
· drugs and intellectual property . trips , the intellectual property regime adopted in the last round of trade negotiations , deprived millions in the developing world of access to life-saving drugs .
as a chorus of researchers has pointed out , the provisions , pushed by the pharmaceutical companies , were so unbalanced that they were bad for scientific progress .
here , there has been some progre@@ ss@@ --but not enough .
provisions demanded by the us would have made it difficult for small countries , like botswana , to gain affordable access .
developing countries also continue to worry about bio-@@ pira@@ cy--the patenting by western firms of traditional foods and drugs .
· textiles .
the uruguay round promised the elimination of quotas in 2004 , enabling many developing countries to exploit another area of comparative advantage .
but many developing countries worry that trade restrictions will remain , whether through ``@@ safeguards &apos; &apos; to protect jobs or through high tariffs .
many also fear that the west will find some way to wiggle out of its commitments .
· a more balanced liberalization agenda .
with services comprising an increasing share of production in developed countries , attention has shifted to liberalization of trade in services .
a more balanced agenda would balance attempts to ease capital flows with efforts to facilitate the flow of labor , including unskilled labor .
· competition .
everyone advocates ``@@ fair competition . &apos; &apos;
but discussions about competition and fair trade again demonstrate the intellectual poverty and inequity of trade negotiations .
anti-dumping laws are intended to ensure fair trade by preventing the sale of goods below cost .
within the developed countries , there has long been concern about such behavior@@ --@@ so-called ``@@ predation &apos; &apos; --and well-defined standards have been developed .
with globalization , it would be natural to extend such principles to the international arena , making it irrelevant whether a producer is domestic or foreign when judging whether he is engaged in an unfair trade practice .
but it does make a difference whether a good is produced at home or abroad .
foreign producers are accused of ``unfair &apos; &apos; competition far more easily than domestic producers .
indeed , if the standards of domestic trade laws were applied internationally , perhaps a majority of firms within the us would be guilty of dumping .
yet america &apos;s supreme court has set standards so high for american firms to be found guilty of predation that few cases are successfully prosecuted domestically .
the trade negotiators are not even discussing eliminating this double standard .
so developing countries worry that efforts to introduce ``@@ competition &apos; &apos; within trade negotiations will only make life even more difficult .
they worry that efforts to promote domestic industries or provide preferential treatment to disadvantaged groups ( the kind of affirmative action programs that have been so important , both in developed and less developed countries ) will be labeled ``unfair &apos; &apos; to foreign firms , and thus be prohibited .
there is a real danger that what was intended to remedy the imbalances of previous trade rounds will not only fail to do so , but may introduce new imbalances .
pushing countries to liberalize their capital markets and open them up to speculative capital flows is one example .
at the very moment when the imf has finally recognized that such liberalization may produce instability but not growth , the wto is now pursuing it .
failure at cancun would confirm the fears of those who resisted a new round of trade negotiations .
needless to say , it would also provide support for the anti-globalization protestors everywhere .

will cap-and-trade incite protectionism ?
cambridge ­ – there is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon-dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures .
while aimed at reducing long-term environmental damage , cap-and-trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future .
scientific evidence appears to indicate that the accumulation of co2 in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels ( primarily coal , oil , and natural gas ) – mainly in electricity production , transportation , and various industrial processes – contributes to gradual global warming , with long-term adverse effects on living conditions around the world .
it is with this in mind that representatives of more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet in copenhagen in december to discuss ways to reduce co2 emissions .
a common suggestion is to impose a tax on all co2 emissions , which would be levied on companies that emit co2 in production , or that sell products like gasoline that cause co2 emissions when used .
such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their co2 emissions , as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay .
the higher cost of production incurred to reduce emissions – and of any emissions tax still due – would , of course , be included in the price charged to consumers .
consumers would respond to the tax-induced increase in the cost of the emissions-intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of co2 emissions .
a carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding co2 to the atmosphere .
that uniform individual cost incentive allows total co2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements , such as automobile mileage standards , production technology standards ( e.g. , minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation ) , etc .
although governments levy taxes on gasoline , they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of taxation .
governments have therefore focused on a cap-and-trade system as a way of increasing the cost of co2-intensive products without explicitly imposing a tax .
in a cap-and-trade system , the government sets total allowable national emissions of co2 per year and requires any firm that causes co2 emissions to have a permit per ton of co2 emitted .
if the government sells these permits in an auction , the price of the permit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax – and with the same resulting increases in consumer prices .
the cap-and-trade system thus imposes a carbon tax without having to admit that it is really a tax .
a cap-and-trade system can cause serious risks to international trade .
even if every country has a cap-and-trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national co2 emissions , the resulting permit prices will differ because of national differences in initial co2 levels and in domestic production characteristics .
because the price of the co2 permits in a country is reflected in the prices of its products , the cap-and-trade system affects its international competitiveness .
when the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on co2 emissions , there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices .
such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products ( being higher on more co2-intensive products ) and among countries ( being higher for countries with low permit prices ) .
such a system of complex differential tariffs is just the kind of protectionism that governments have been working to eliminate since the start of the gatt process more than 50 years ago .
worse still , cap-and-trade systems in practice do not rely solely on auctions to distribute the emissions permits .
the plan working its way through the united states congress ( the waxman-markey bill ) would initially give away 85 % of the permits , impose a complex set of regulatory policies , and allow companies to buy co2 offsets ( e.g. , by paying for the planting of trees ) instead of reducing their emissions or buying permits .
such complexities make it impossible to compare the impact of co2 policies among countries , which in turn would invite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher tariff levels .
there is no easy answer to this problem .
but before rushing to impose tariffs , it is important to remember that cap-and-trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competitiveness .
better roads , ports , and even schools all contribute to a country ’ s competitiveness .
no one attempts to use tariffs to balance those government-created differences in competitiveness , and there should be no such attempts if a cap-and-trade system is introduced .
if an international agreement to impose a cap-and-trade scheme is adopted in copenhagen , the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce offsetting tariffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade .

will china lead ?
new york – china ’ s willingness to join negotiations on potential sanctions against iran and to send president hu jintao to a nuclear security summit in washington this month are important preliminary steps towards taking more responsibility in managing international affairs .
but merely joining conversations or showing up for meetings is not enough .
given its growing profile , china must do far more to demonstrate its bona fides as a responsible global leader or risk undermining the system that has enabled its own miraculous rise .
china has emerged as a world power far more quickly than most observers – and china ’ s own leaders – might have predicted as little as a decade ago .
china ’ s rapid economic growth , juxtaposed against america ’ s problems in iraq and afghanistan , monumental debt , and role in sparking the global financial crisis , have changed global power realities – and global perceptions of those realities even more .
china ’ s current international influence likely outstrips its desire or capacity .
this puts china in a difficult position in relation to the so-called international system – the structures and rules created by the united states and others after the second world war to check national sovereignty through a system of overlapping jurisdictions , transnational obligations , and fundamental rights .
china has been an enormous beneficiary of this system , and its rise would have been unthinkable without the us-led free-trade system and globalization process , access to us markets , and global shipping lanes secured by the us navy .
but china ’ s history of humiliation at the hands of european colonial powers has made its leaders ardent supporters of inviolable national rights and suspicious of any sacrifice of sovereignty .
because china ’ s leaders are not popularly elected , their legitimacy stems largely from two sources – their connection to the chinese revolution and their ability to deliver national security and economic growth .
although mao zedong is widely implicated in the unnecessary death of millions and is officially designated by the current regime as having been 30 % wrong , his photograph still ador@@ ns tiananmen square , because the regime ’ s legitimacy depends in part on its connection to the restoration of national sovereignty that mao represents .
the economic foundation of the chinese government ’ s legitimacy also places an enormous burden on china ’ s leaders to make decisions that foster domestic economic growth at the expense of virtually everything else – including , some say , the viability of the international currency regime , nuclear non-proliferation , and basic rights in resource-rich countries .
this dichotomy creates a difficult situation as china emerges as the world ’ s second largest economy .
if china , in the name of national sovereignty , does not buy into the international system , it becomes hard to argue that this system exists .
china ’ s unwillingness , for example , to join other members of the international community in pressuring iran and north korea to abandon nuclear weapons programs foreshadows the potential collapse of the nuclear non-proliferation regime .
china ’ s active courtship of countries that violate human rights on a massive scale , such as sudan , north korea , and burma , similarly represents a preliminary decapitation of the international human rights regime .
given its size and importance , and regardless of its intentions , china will , perhaps inadvertently , destroy the international system if it does not either actively endorse and work to maintain it , or reframe it for the greater common good .
if it does neither , the world is in trouble .
if china sees itself as the heir and beneficiary of the us-led post-war international system , it must do much more to prevent and roll back nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , pay a much greater percentage of costs for the united nations , and curtail its mercantilist policies .
it must also end its alleged corrupt practices in resource-rich parts of the developing world , align its currency policy with global norms , lead efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions , and , more generally , take into more account the fate of people outside of china in its decision-making .
if , on the other hand , as is its right , chinese leaders have an alternative vision of what an improved international system might look like , the onus is on them to articulate that vision and outline what they are willing to do to realize it .
there may be a better international model than the current one , but it will not emerge by default .
as us presidents franklin roosevelt and harry truman demonstrated in the 1940 ’ s , such a system must be articulated and then forged through decisive action and global leadership .
if china sees inviolable state sovereignty as the foundation of twenty-first century international affairs , as now appears to be the case , then it must explain why this principle will not lead to the same disastrous consequences as it did in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .
the us and the international community must acknowledge that today ’ s fast-rising china has earned the right to play an important role in shaping how the twenty-first century unfolds .
but if china ’ s leaders will neither do more to support the current international system , nor articulate an alternative , and instead continue to hark back to nineteenth-century models of inviolable sovereignty , they will destroy a global order that , warts and all , has served the world exceedingly well .
those countries that value the current system will increasingly feel the urge to close ranks to defend it .

will china “ lose ” the 2008 olympics ?
when the international olympic committee awarded beijing the 2008 summer games in july 2001 , the announcement ignited wild celebrations across the country .
the chinese communist party hoped to use the games to showcase the country ’ s emergence as a dynamic , modern nation .
but as china ’ s leaders begin final preparations for the games next august , they may be wondering if hosting the event was such a good idea after all .
they have significant reasons for doubt .
china ’ s senior leaders always closely monitor spontaneous public expressions of nationalist fervor , fearful that shifting winds might blow an unwelcome storm in their direction .
of course what they hope is that the games will channel these energies toward national solidarity , which will allow the leadership to deliver its people a moment of achievement and patriotic glory .
but the olympics will also bring intense international scrutiny of china ’ s weaknesses at a delicate moment in the country ’ s development .
the world already knows of china ’ s success and its attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment , but few outsiders have seen firsthand the steep price the country is paying for its new prosperity .
the most obvious signs of that cost flow through the country ’ s waterways and contaminate its air .
runaway growth and development have left about 70 % of china ’ s lakes and rivers severely polluted , many unfit for human use of any kind .
indeed , nearly a half-billion chinese lack access to clean drinking water , and the number of terminally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily .
but air quality will prove the more embarrassing problem next august .
television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide beijing with the signature olympic image it had in mind , and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage .
there is also the risk that the games will become a political circus , as the international spotlight generates irresistible opportunities for public protest .
the chinese leadership has demonstrated many times that it can quell domestic dissent , but the unique scale of the olympics will require round-the-clock vigilance .
activists with grievances over tibet , taiwan , burma , darfur , and dozens of other political , environmental , and human-rights issues are already making plans .
is china ready for greenpeace , human rights in china , amnesty international , and falun gong supporters to take to the streets , with thousands of foreign journalists hungry for stories and asking questions that the authorities are unaccustomed to answering ?
even if police are able to maintain order in beijing , can they extend that control across the country ?
can they manage the flow of information and ideas through the blogosphere as online activists open yet another front in their battle for free information ?
what we do know that chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose face .
the games will generate significant foreign-policy risks as well .
in taiwan , outgoing president chen shui-bian is stirring the independence pot , knowing that the olympic spotlight will limit beijing ’ s ability to respond forcefully .
he has already proposed a popular referendum on taiwanese membership in the united nations .
china ’ s influence within the un would prevent such a move even if taiwan voted yes , but an international confrontation is the last thing china wants coinciding with the olympics .
then there is the matter of how the games will be received in the west .
since 2001 , china has increasingly become the focal point of much anxiety in the developed world .
huge bilateral trade deficits , accusations that china keeps its currency undervalued , and a rash of defective and dangerous chinese-made exports have fueled a protectionist backlash in the united states and europe .
amid bitter election-year debates over iraq and iran , and a souring economic outlook , americans may be in no mood for the triumphalist pageantry of a new rising power on display in beijing .
will china ’ s uneasy asian neighbors be any more receptive ?
international criticism is sure to follow if something , anything , goes wrong during the games , especially if it involves the suppression of dissent and is vec@@ tored around the world via 24-hour cable television and the internet .
china has changed since it “ won ” the 2008 games seven years ago .
the party leadership has grown more self-assured in its growing international role , but its ability to manage the pace of change at home has become more uncertain .
in 2001 , then president jiang zemin hoped the games would herald china ’ s arrival as an industrialized power .
but his successor , hu jintao , has focused on the damage that has come from unrestrained growth .
he and premier wen jiabao have also championed a more “ harmonious ” society , because they understand that the growing wealth gap , social tensions , environmental and public health problems , and the party ’ s tenuous relationship with china ’ s less advantaged people can no longer be neglected .
how they look back on the games once the conf@@ etti is swept from the streets is far from certain .

will china rule the world ?
cambridge – thirty years ago , china had a tiny footprint on the global economy and little influence outside its borders , save for a few countries with which it had close political and military relationships .
today , the country is a remarkable economic power : the world ’ s manufacturing workshop , its foremost financier , a leading investor across the globe from africa to latin america , and , increasingly , a major source of research and development .
the chinese government sits atop an astonishing level of foreign reserves – greater than $ 2 trillion .
there is not a single business anywhere in the world that has not felt china ’ s impact , either as a low-cost supplier , or more threateningly , as a formidable competitor .
china is still a poor country .
although average incomes have risen very rapidly in recent decades , they still stand at between one-seventh and one-eighth the levels in the united states – lower than in turkey or colombia and not much higher than in el salvador or egypt .
while coastal china and its major metropolises evince tremendous wealth , large swaths of western china remain mired in poverty .
meanwhile , the us , the world ’ s sole economic hyper-power until recently , remains a diminished giant . it stands humbled by its foreign-policy blunders and a massive financial crisis .
its credibility after the disastrous invasion of iraq is at an all-time low , notwithstanding the global sympathy for president barack obama , and its economic model is in tatters .
the once-almighty dollar tot@@ ters at the mercy of china and the oil-rich states .
all of which raises the question of whether china will eventually replace the us as the world ’ s hegemon , the global economy ’ s rule setter and enforcer .
in a fascinating new book , revealingly titled when china rules the world , the british scholar and journalist martin jacques is unequivocal : if you think china will be integrated smoothly into a liberal , capitalist , and democratic world system , jacques argues , you are in for a big surprise .
not only is china the next economic superpower , but the world order that it will construct will look very different from what we have had under american leadership .
americans and europeans blithely assume that china will become more like them as its economy develops and its population gets richer .
this is a mirage , jacques says .
the chinese and their government are wedded to a different conception of society and polity : community-based rather than individualist , state-@@ centric rather than liberal , authoritarian rather than democratic .
china has 2,000 years of history as a distinct civilization from which to draw strength .
it will not simply fold under western values and institutions .
a world order centered on china will reflect chinese values rather than western ones , jacques argues .
beijing will overshadow new york , the renminbi will replace the dollar , mandarin will take over from english , and schoolchildren around the world will learn about zheng he ’ s voyages of discovery along the eastern coast of africa rather than about vasco de gama or christopher columbus .
gone will be the evangelism of markets and democracy .
china is much less likely to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states .
but , in return , it will demand that smaller , less powerful states explicitly recognize china ’ s primacy ( just as in the tributary systems of old ) .
before any of this comes to pass , however , china will have to continue its rapid economic growth and maintain its social cohesion and political unity . none of this is guaranteed .
beneath china ’ s powerful economic dynamo lie deep tensions , inequalities , and cleavages that could well derail a smooth progression to global hegemony .
throughout its long history , centrifugal forces have often pushed the country into disarray and disintegration .
china ’ s stability hinges critically on its government ’ s ability to deliver steady economic gains to the vast majority of the population .
china is the only country in the world where anything less than 8 % growth year after year is believed to be dangerous because it would unleash social unrest .
most of the rest of the world only dreams about growth at that rate , which speaks volumes about the underlying fragility of the chinese system .
the authoritarian nature of the political regime is at the core of this fragility .
it allows only repression when the government faces protests and opposition outside the established channels .
the trouble is that it will become increasingly difficult for china to maintain the kind of growth that it has experienced in recent years . china ’ s growth currently relies on an undervalued currency and a huge trade surplus .
this is unsustainable , and sooner or later it will precipitate a major confrontation with the us ( and europe ) .
there are no easy ways out of this dilemma .
china will likely have to settle for lower growth .
if china sur@@ mounts these hurdles and does eventually become the world ’ s predominant economic power , globalization will , indeed , take on chinese characteristics .
democracy and human rights will then likely lose their luster as global norms .
that is the bad news .
the good news is that a chinese global order will display greater respect for national sovereignty and more tolerance for national diversity .
there will be greater room for experimentation with different economic models .

will china ’ s capitalist revolution turn democratic
communist china has experienced a monumental capitalist revolution in the last two decades , with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago .
a minor player in the global economy in the 1980 ’ s , china today is the world ’ s third largest trading power .
but if these stunning economic statistics make you think that so much capitalist development must also have brought more democracy to china , think again .
most westerners believe in a theory of liberal evolution , according to which sustained economic growth , by increasing wealth and the size of the middle class , gradually makes a country more democratic .
while the long-run record of this theory is irrefutable , china ’ s authoritarian ruling elite is not only determined to hold on to power , but it also has been smart enough to take adaptive measures aimed at countering the liberalizing effects of economic development .
thus , for all its awe-inspiring economic achievement , china has made remarkably little progress in political liberalization .
indeed , judging by several key indicators , progress toward democracy in china has stalled , despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom .
for instance , in the mid-1980 ’ s , chinese leaders seriously discussed and later drew up a blueprint for modest democratic reforms .
today , the topic of political reform is taboo .
nearly all the major institutional reforms , such as strengthening the legislature , holding village elections , and building a modern legal system , were launched in the 1980 ’ s .
since the tiananmen square massacre of june 1989 , however , not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented .
instead of democratic transition , china has witnessed a consolidation of authoritarian rule – the strengthening of a one-party regime through organizational learning and adaptation .
since 1989 , the chinese communist party ( ccp ) has been pursuing a two-pronged strategy : selective repression that targets organized political opposition and co-optation of new social elites ( the intelligentsia , professionals , and private entrepreneurs ) .
this strategy emphasizes the maintenance of an extensive law enforcement apparatus designed to eliminate any incipient organized opposition .
huge investments have strengthened the people ’ s armed police ( pap ) , a large anti-@@ riot paramilitary force whose specialty is the quick suppression of anti-government protests by disgruntled industrial workers , peasants , and urban residents .
frequent deployment of the pap is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective protests that occur each year ( 74,000 in 2004 and 86,000 in 2005 ) have had a negligible impact on china ’ s overall stability .
to deal with new emerging political threats , such as the information revolution , the chinese government has spent mightily on manpower and technology .
a special 3@@ 0,000-strong police unit monitors and screens internet traffic , advanced technology is deployed to block access to overseas web sites considered “ hostile or harmful , ” and internet service and content providers , both domestic and western , must comply with onerous restrictions designed to suppress political dissent and track down offenders .
the regime has even conducted multi-agency exercises to test whether different government bodies could cooperate closely to keep “ harmful information ” off the net during an emergency .
having learned from the collapse of the soviet union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co-opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders , the communist party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base .
the urban intelligentsia and professionals have been pampered with material perks and political recognition , while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the party .
this strategy of pre-emptive political decapitation has produced enormous dividends for the party .
in the 1980 ’ s , its principal adversaries were the urban intelligentsia , who constituted the backbone of the pro-democracy movement that culminated in tiananmen square .
today , the mainstream of the chinese intelligentsia is an integral part of the ruling elite .
many have joined the party and become government officials , and a large percentage enjoy various professional and financial privileges .
predictably , the intelligentsia , usually the most liberal social group , is no longer a lethal threat to party rule .
worse , without support from this strategic group , other social groups , such as workers and peasants , have become politically marginalized and rudderless .
although the party ’ s carrot-and-stick approach has worked since 1989 , it is doubtful that it will retain its efficacy for another 17 years .
to the extent that china ’ s authoritarian regime is by nature exclusionary ( it can only incorporate a limited number of elites ) , the co-optation strategy will soon run up against its limits , and the party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intelligentsia or keep private entrepreneurs happy .
at the same time , selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily .
as long as much of chinese society views the current political system as unjust , unresponsive , and corrupt , there will always be a large reservoir of ill will toward the ruling elites .
when things go wrong – as is likely , given mounting social strains caused by rising inequality , environmental degradation , and deteriorating public services – china ’ s alienated masses could become politically radicalized .
and , unlike past protests , which have usually been allied with students or members of the intelligentsia , popular disaffection might not have the virtue of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negotiate .
so it may be premature for the party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy .
china ’ s rulers may have stalled democratic trends for now , but the current strategy has , perhaps , merely delayed the inevitable .

will china stand up in north korea ?
on october 1 , 1949 , as chiang kai-chek &apos;s defeated kuomintang ( kmt ) troops fled for taiwan , mao zedong declared that &quot; china has stood up . &quot;
china has , indeed , stood up , and continues to rise as one of the world &apos;s largest economies .
last year , china alone accounted for roughly 60 % of global export growth .
nowhere does this seem truer than in china &apos;s own backyard .
beijing &apos;s seeming silence over the nuclear ambitions of north korea has left us , japanese , and south korean officials alike wondering when it will &quot; stand up &quot; to assert its influence over its neighbor and erstwhile ally .
one reason china seems paralyzed in the current crisis is that , among the world &apos;s major powers , it is almost alone in having a genuine &quot; two koreas &quot; policy .
since china established diplomatic relations with south korea in the early l990 &apos;s , economic ties have grown dramatically , and cultural relations have expanded at a comparable pace .
china also reciprocated outgoing president kim dae-jung &apos;s overtures in the political-@@ security realm , despite south korea &apos;s strategic ties with the us .
but in recognizing south korea , china took greater care than , say , russia , in seeking to ameliorate north korea &apos;s anxieties .
china is north korea &apos;s most important trading partner , with turnover exceeding $ 700 million in 2002 , up 30 % from 2001 .
indeed , china is believed to supply about 70 % of the north &apos;s oil , and has doubled its sales of grain and vegetables .
while china no longer promises the north military support ( except in the event of external attack ) , &quot; consultations &quot; are pledged .
privately , china &apos;s leaders are dubious ( at best ) about north korea .
they think that economic reform is long overdue , and , like others , consider kim jong-il &apos;s political system bizarre .
for their part , north korea &apos;s elite understands that they have no true allies at present , not even in beijing .
yet kim jong-il &apos;s two trips to china illustrate his interest in china &apos;s reforms and his desire to cultivate china &apos;s support .
how much the chinese know about the inner workings of north korea &apos;s policy-making and power structure , and how much influence they can have , are uncertain .
china claims that its power over pyongyang is limited .
what china wants above all is to prevent north korea from collapsing , whatever the cause .
conflict on the korean peninsula , nourished by the vitriolic language often employed by kim jong-il &apos;s regime , is china &apos;s nightmare .
war between the koreas would confront beijing with a flood of hundreds of thousands of refugees .
equally important , china is wary of the prospect of korea being unified under south korean rule and backed up by continued strategic support from the us .
fortunately , north korea &apos;s leaders prefer survival to suicide .
they know that despite the extensive damage that they could inflict on the south , in the end , they would be destroyed by american and south korean power if combat ever starts .
hence , war initiated by the north , while not unthinkable , seems unlikely .
a third possibility is an indefinite continuation of the status quo .
this , too , seems doubtful .
north korea is a failing state economically , a fact that kim jong-il and his cronies appear to recognize .
since the mid-@@ l990 &apos;s , they have been explor@@ ing--@@ albeit cautiously and uncertain@@ ly-@@ -@@ avenues of change , including flawed price liberalization many prices in mid-2002 .
whatever the eventual outcome , the status quo is untenable .
a fourth alternative , favored by china and other key players , is an evolutionary process that combines economic reform with increased interaction with the external world , focusing initially on south korea .
china will move carefully but firmly in promoting this path .
it is anxious to see a us-north korea dialogue begin , one capable of alleviating the north &apos;s anxieties about an american attack and america &apos;s concerns about a renewed nuclear program .
indeed , the main factor fueling the current crisis and complicating its resolution is that the north has only one bargaining chip : threats .
aside from a pledge of non-aggression , its central interest is in obtaining economic assistance .
yet the us and others are wary of being labeled appeasers .
well aware of the complexities and hazar@@ ds-@@ -and seeking to avoid alienating any of the parties--@@ china is willing to play the role of convener , but not adjudic@@ ator , of an american-@@ north korean dialogue .
thus , its proclaimed &quot; disagreement &quot; with north korea &apos;s withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty was relatively mild .
nonetheless , china &apos;s stake in the outcome of the current crisis is big enough to make it a party to a wide range of exchanges , formal and informal , bilateral and multilater@@ al--@@ all with the objective of promoting change without upheaval on the korean peninsula .
in this respect , the us and china have common interests , as do japan , russia , and south korea .
china , too , believes that if advocates of &quot; regime change &quot; do not push north korea too hard , a strategy can be pursued that is based on slow evolution rather than a precipitous break@@ --and a possible violent breakdown .

could china turn inward ?
shanghai – on the face of it , china and the united states both look as though they would be relatively insulated if trade tensions continue to escalate .
china ’ s exports to the us account for only 4 % of its gdp , and its imports from the us amount to just 1 % of gdp .
in the us , with its large , domestically driven economy , the equivalent figures are 1 % and 3 % .
but putting aside these headline numbers , a retreat from globalization by the world ’ s two largest economies would nonetheless entail significant costs .
true , china has been rebalancing away from exports : domestic consumption contributed to more than 60 % of its gdp growth in ten of the 15 quarters since 2015 , and up to 80 % in the first half of 2018 .
in many consumer categories , china is now the world ’ s largest market .
and it also now accounts for 30 % of global auto sales ( and 43 % of unit sales of electric vehicles ) and 42 % of global retail e-commerce transaction value .
moreover , the mckinsey global institute finds that while the world ’ s exposure to china in terms of trade , technology , and capital increased from 2000 to 2017 , china ’ s exposure to the world peaked in 2007 , and has declined ever since .
as recently as 2008 , china ’ s net trade surplus accounted for 8 % of its gdp ; by 2017 , it had fallen to 1.7 % .
that is less than either germany or south korea , where net exports generate 5-8 % of gdp .
following a sustained period in which china drove global growth , it seems as though its great “ opening up ” is losing momentum .
after china joined the world trade organization in 2001 , it cut tariffs by half , bringing them down to 8 % as of 2008 .
yet , by 2016 , they had edged back up to 9.6 % – a rate that is more than double the us and eu average .
at the same time , china ’ s barriers to foreign capital inflows to services remain high .
and the government appears to promote the growth of local companies , not least through its “ made in china 2025 ” plan , which sets guidelines for domestic companies in 11 of 23 high-priority sub@@ sectors .
still , these trends do not necessarily mean that china is closing itself off from the world .
in fact , there are five reasons why an increasingly autar@@ chic china is unlikely .
for starters , china remains dependent on foreign technology , with half of its technology imports coming from just three countries – the us ( 27 % ) , japan ( 17 % ) , and germany ( 11 % ) – between 2011 and 2016 .
more to the point , these numbers have barely budged over the past 20 years , despite china ’ s efforts to boost innovation at home .
second , were china to close itself off , it would damage its neighbors ’ economic prospects , thus destabilizing its own immediate region .
for example , according to a recent oecd analysis , malaysia , singapore , and south korea could lose 0.5-1.5 % of gdp each as a result of reduced us-china trade .
this , in turn , would set back china ’ s ambitions to be the region ’ s trade anchor .
third , with a turn inward , china would start to miss out on investment and know-how from the multinationals currently operating in its economy .
as of 2015 , there were 4@@ 81,000 foreign enterprises in china ( more than twice as many as in 2000 ) , employing around 14 million workers .
about 40 % of china ’ s exports are produced by foreign companies , or by foreign-@@ domestic joint ventures .
moreover , foreign firms produce 87 % of electronics in china , and 59 % of machinery .
not by coincidence , those are the sectors most affected by the current trade dispute .
a survey conducted by the american chamber of commerce in china reinforces concerns about the impact of escalating trade tensions on foreign investment .
already , 31 % of us firms say they may delay or cancel investment decisions , 18 % may relocate some or all of their manufacturing outside china , and 3 % may even exit the chinese market altogether .
fourth , a reduction in trade could sap the reform momentum china needs to iron out the many inefficiencies in its domestic economy .
for example , china ’ s efforts to position its financial system to manage the risks associated with high debt levels will be sidelined if it is forced to provide more liquidity to the economy to make up for trade losses .
likewise , china ’ s inefficient state-owned enterprises – whose return on assets is only 30-50 % that of private-sector companies – need to be overhauled as part of a broader agenda to boost productivity .
but if the economy comes under pressure , those efforts , too , could be delayed for fear of undermining employment .
finally , and more broadly , there is ample evidence showing that global interconnectedness is good for growth .
mgi finds that global flows of goods , services , capital , people , and data over the past decade have boosted world gdp by around 10 % above where it otherwise would have been .
a reversal of china ’ s great opening up would hurt not just china , but everyone – including the us .
losing access to chinese markets , capital flows , exports , and talent would result in higher prices and slower growth , whereas the benefits of reduced levels of competition to us industries are less clear .
chinese imports have cut the price of us consumer goods by an estimated 27 % .
and firms in the us would take a direct hit from higher tariffs in trade , given that 77 % of china ’ s exports to the us are intermediary and capital goods used to produce finished products , according to the mckinsey global trade database .
turning inward may be tempting for china , but the economic costs of doing so would be significant .
one hopes – perhaps against hope – that the 90-day truce on tariff increases lasts , so that an enduring trade agreement can be forged .

will london survive brexit ?
london – brexit has set a hungry cat among the financial pigeons of the city of london .
no one yet knows what kind of access to the european union ’ s single financial market uk-based firms will have , and prime minister theresa may ’ s call for a general election to be held on june 8 has further clouded the picture , at least in the short term .
but there is a nagging assumption that things cannot remain the same , and that there will be a price to be paid for leaving the eu .
so uk-based financial services firms , especially those that have chosen london as their european headquarters precisely in order to secure access to the whole eu market from one location , are reviewing their options .
indeed , regulators are obliging them to do so , by asking how they will maintain continuity of service to their clients in the event of a “ hard ” brexit .
( may ’ s government prefers to talk of a “ clean ” brexit , but that is semantics ) .
rival european centers have spotted an opportunity to claw some of this business back to the continent ( or to ireland ) .
other governments have long resented london ’ s dominance .
it was galling to have to acknowledge that the principal center for trading in euro-denominated instruments lay outside the eurozone .
just a few years ago , the european central bank tried to insist that the clearing of euro instruments should take place within its jurisdiction , but was prevented from doing so by a ruling from the european court of justice .
that is somewhat ironic : removing the uk from the ecj ’ s jurisdiction is now one of may ’ s principal aims .
so delegation after delegation of ministers , mayors , and assorted financial center lobbyists have been filling london ’ s best hotels and providing a welcome boost to the high-end restaurant trade .
luxembourg , frankfurt , dublin , and others have been making glossy presentations about their cities ’ competitive advantages over london : lower property costs , lower corporate tax rates ( that sounds plausible when claimed with an irish accent ) , michelin-@@ starred restaurants , and porsche dealerships – all the essential services that make up a vibrant financial center .
some of these presentations have raised a wry smile or two .
french president françois hollande was elected on a claim that the world of high finance was his enemy .
yet the president of the paris region recently promised a “ red , white , and blue carpet ” for any hedge fund manager who buys a one-way eurostar ticket to the gare du nord – a barbed reference to former uk prime minister david cameron ’ s promise of a red carpet for french bankers fleeing prohibitive tax rates , strikes , and restrictive labor laws .
suddenly , everyone loves those masters of the universe who nearly destroyed the world ’ s financial system in 2008 .
all this promotional activity has raised anew the question of just what combination of characteristics a successful financial center must have .
the question has been asked many times , and management consul@@ tancies have earned good money offering their patent answers .
a pre-crisis study by mckinsey for former new york city mayor michael bloomberg recommended copying london ’ s regulatory system , which blew up soon thereafter .
hong kong officials ’ review of their own regulations , carried out to identify ways to boost the city ’ s attractiveness to international firms , found that what firms really wanted was cleaner air and more international schools .
neither is within the jurisdiction of the monetary authority ( or even , in the case of air pollution , of the hong kong government ) .
many of the surveys asking firms why they choose a particular location produce essentially circular answers . they say they are there because other firms are , and they can therefore conduct business easily with their principal counterparties .
there are , however , a few consistent themes .
foreign firms like to think that they are treated no differently from domestic competitors .
so politically driven regulation is a tur@@ n-@@ off .
they also want an independent court system that upholds property rights .
and they want access to skilled staff .
on these measures , london and new york continue to do well .
the latest global financial centres index , published last month by z / yen , shows that london remains at the top of the league , marginally ahead of new york .
but the ratings of both have declined sharply over the last year , and the gap between them and third-place singapore , more than 30 points last year , is only 20 this year .
indeed , almost all of the asian centers have lifted their ratings , with beijing rising the fastest , moving from 26th to 16th place .
if we look specifically at europe , the only other financial center in the global top 20 is luxembourg , which creeps in at 18 , six places lower than last year .
frankfurt , at 23 , fell four places this year , and paris has been stuck at 29 for the last couple of surveys .
so london has a huge lead in europe .
will brexit be enough to alter that picture fundamentally ?
it remains hard to say .
on the key factors for firms , london ’ s nationality-@@ blind regulatory system is not likely to change ; nor is the court system .
so those advantages should be sustained .
the key swing factor is likely to be the availability of skilled staff .
london-based financial firms are accustomed to being able to recruit from across the eu ; indeed , the british authorities have been flexible on non-eu staff , too .
because most aspiring finance professionals in europe can speak good english , firms have had a deep pool in which to fish .
whether that pool survives brexit will turn out to be the biggest political question for the city of london in the coming negotiations .
the next uk prime minister , who just might be may , will need to produce a good answer , or london will not remain at the top of the league for much longer .

the mirage of the financial singularity
new haven – in their new book the incredible shrinking alpha , larry e. swedroe and andrew l. berkin describe an investment environment populated by increasingly sophisticated analysts who rely on big data , powerful computers , and scholarly research .
with all this competition , “ the hurdles to achieving alpha &#91; returns above a risk-adjusted benchmark – and thus a measure of success in picking individual investments &#93; are getting higher and higher . ”
that conclusion raises a key question : will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy ?
more fundamentally , is the day approaching when , thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers , financial markets really do become perfect , and we can just sit back , relax , and assume that all assets are priced correctly ?
this imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity , analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity , when computers replace human intelligence .
the financial singularity implies that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program , because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seamless system .
many believe that we are almost there .
even legendary investors like warren buffett , it is argued , are not really outperforming the market .
in a recent paper , “ buffett ’ s alpha , ” andrea frazzini and david kabiller of aqr capital management and lasse pedersen of copenhagen business school , conclude that buffett is not generating significantly positive alpha if one takes account of certain lesser-known risk factors that have weighed heavily in his portfolio .
the implication is that buffet ’ s genius could be replicated by a computer program that incorporates these factors .
if that were true , investors would abandon , en masse , their efforts to ferret out mispricing in the market , because there wouldn ’ t be any . market participants would rationally assume that every stock price is the true expected present value of future cash flows , with the appropriate rate of discount , and that those cash flows reflect fundamentals that everyone understands the same way .
indeed , according to a computer crunching big data , this would be an optimal decision .
there is a long-recognized problem with such perfect markets : no one would want to expend any effort to figure out what oscillations in prices mean for the future .
thirty-five years ago , in their classic paper , “ on the impossibility of information@@ ally efficient markets , ” sanford grossman and joseph stiglitz presented this problem as a paradox : perfectly efficient markets require the effort of smart money to make them so ; but if markets were perfect , smart money would give up trying .
the grossman-stiglitz conundrum seems less compelling in the financial singularity if we can imagine that computers direct all the investment decisions .
although alpha may be vanishingly small , it still represents enough profit to keep the computers running .
but the real problem with this vision of financial singularity is not the grossman-stiglitz conundrum ; it is that real-world markets are nowhere close to it .
computer enthusiasts are excited by things like the blockchain used by bitcoin ( covered on an education website called singularity university , in a section dramatically titled exponential finance ) .
but the futurists ’ financial world bears no resemblance to today ’ s financial world .
after all , the financial singularity implies that all prices would be based on such things as optimally projected future corporate profits and the correlation of profits with expected technological innovations and long-term demographic changes .
but the smart money hardly ever talks in such ethereal terms .
in this context , it is difficult not to think of china ’ s recent stock-market plunge .
news accounts depict hordes of emotional people trading on hunch and superstition .
that looks a lot more like reality than all the talk of impending financial singularity .
markets seem to be driven by stories , as i emphasize in my book irrational exuberance .
there are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions .
there are fundamental stories about technology and declining resources . and there are stories about politics and bizarre conspiracies .
no one knows if these stories are true , but they take on a life of their own .
when one has a hear@@ t-to-@@ heart talk with many seemingly rational people , they turn out to have crazy theories .
these people influence markets , because all other investors must reckon with them ; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon .
maybe buffett ’ s past investing style can be captured in a trading algorithm today .
but that does not necessarily detract from his genius .
indeed , the true source of his success may consist in his understanding of when to abandon one method and devise another .
the idea of financial singularity may seem inspiring ; but it is no less illusory than the rational utopia that inspired generations of central planners .
human judgment , good and bad , will drive investment decisions and financial-market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond .

are emerging markets the canary in the financial coal mine ?
buenos aires – are brewing exchange-rate and debt crises in argentina and turkey localized events without broader implications ?
or are they early warning signs of deeper fragilities in bloated global debt markets that are being exposed as the us federal reserve continues to normalize interest rates ?
rising interest rates could test stability in some advanced economies as well , especially in italy , where voters , particularly in the less developed south , have opted decisively for a disruptive populist government .
with an economy ten times the size of greece , a default in italy would blow up the eurozone .
indeed , the populist coalition government that has now taken power has hinted that it wants write-offs for some of its under-the-@@ table debts ( not included in italy ’ s official public debt of over 130 % of gdp ) to the euro system through the european central bank .
the good news is that a full-blown global debt crisis is still relatively unlikely to erupt .
even with a recent softening of european performance , the overall global economic picture remains strong , with most regions of the world still growing briskly .
although it is true that several emerging-market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar-denominated external debt , many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets , especially in asia .
the international monetary fund , moreover , has sufficient resources to handle a first wave of crises , even if it includes , say , brazil .
the main concern is not that the imf will fail to deliver funds , but that it will make the same mistake it did in greece , by not imposing a realistic deal on debtors and creditors .
as for italy , chances are that europe will find a way to grant temporarily some of the extra budget slack the new government seeks , even if there is no way eurozone officials can allow high-debt italy simply to destroy the common currency .
the most important reason for optimism , notwithstanding all the surrounding political noise , is that global long-term real interest rates are still extremely low .
even with all the drama surrounding fed tightening , 30-year inflation-indexed treasury bills are paying around 1 % – far below long-term real returns , which have averaged closer to 3 % .
as long as the underlying global interest-rate picture is so benign , it is hard to see the big kah@@ una of bond-@@ default waves coming just yet .
it is notable how much the imf , the world ’ s debt and financial crisis watchdog , has been ratcheting up its warnings .
after years of saying advanced countries no longer need to worry about their near-record public-debt levels – now averaging over 100 % for general government debt – the imf has started to warn that many countries may find themselves squeezed for fiscal space if faced with a new recession anytime soon .
the challenges stem not only from debt that is on the books , but also from hidden liabilities , owing most notably to massively underfunded old-age pension and health-care programs – implicit debts that in many cases are far larger than the official figures .
the overwhelming evidence of recent research supports the imf view .
countries with historically high debt levels have ( on average ) significantly poorer growth performance in the face of major shocks , and the long-term relation between high public debt and growth is distinctly negative .
this , of course , says absolutely nothing about the economic consequences of actively reducing the burden of government debt , popularly known as “ austerity . ”
deep recessions are the time to use a country ’ s war chest , not the time to build it up .
admittedly , there are those on both the left and the right who think “ this time is different ” for advanced economies .
with no realistic danger ( in their view ) of a major war or financial crisis anytime soon , it is folly to exercise too much restraint on public debt or pension promises .
this is dangerous thinking even for the united states , despite the greater fiscal scope it enjoys as the issuer of the global reserve currency .
very bad shocks can happen to any economy , and their sources might not be the ones we normally consider .
for example , risks stemming from cyberattacks ( especially by state actors ) , pandemics , and certainly financial crises are probably far higher than anyone would like to admit .
it is certainly not difficult to imagine a temporary slowdown in fast-growing china that could roil world markets .
and if the completely unexpected does happen , one thing we can anticipate is that governments with strong access to global credit markets will have much better options for responding .
even if the best bet is that any emerging-market bond meltdown would remain contained , today ’ s jitters ought to be a wake-up call , even for advanced economies .
after all , no country , however rich , should bet its future on the prospect that today ’ s ultra-@@ benign interest-rate environment will last forever .
economists who assure us that advanced-economy debt is completely “ safe ” sound eerily like those who touted the “ great moderation ” – the supposedly permanent reduction in cyclical volatility – a generation ago .
in many cases , they are the same people .
but , as we saw a decade ago , and will inevitably see again , we are not at the “ end of history ” when it comes to global debt and financial crises .

will europe be willing but disabled ?
newport beach – when it comes to describing europe ’ s ever-worsening crisis , metaphors abound .
for some , it is five minutes to midnight ; for others , europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff .
for all , a perilous existential moment is increasingly close at hand .
optimists – fortunately , there remain a few , especially in europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical , political leaders will turn things around and put europe back on the path of economic growth , job creation , and financial stability .
but pessimists have been growing in number and influence .
they see political dysfunction adding to financial turmoil , thereby amplifying the eurozone ’ s initial design flaws .
of course , who is ultimately proven correct is a function of eurozone governments ’ willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required , and in a coordinated and timely fashion .
but that is not the only determinant : governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materializes .
and here , the endless delays are making the challenges more daunting and the outcome more uncertain .
experienced observers remind us that crises , rather than vision , have tended to drive progress at critical stages of europe ’ s historic integration – a multi-decade journey driven by the desire to ensure long-term peace and prosperity in what previously had been one of the world ’ s most violent regions and the site of appalling human suffering .
after all , the european union ( including the eurozone ’ s 17 members ) remains a collective of nation-states with notable divergences in economic , financial , and social conditions .
political cycles are far from synchronized .
and too many regional governance mechanisms , with the important exception of the european central bank , lack sufficient influence , credibility , and , therefore , effectiveness .
left to its own devices , such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering , disruptive posturing , and disagreement over visions of the future .
as a result , progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be painfully slow during the good times .
but all of this can change rapidly when a crisis looms , especially if it threatens the integrity of the european project .
that is where the eurozone is today .
a debt crisis that erupted in greece , the eurozone ’ s outer periphery , has migrated with a vengeance towards the core , so much so that the survival of the eurozone itself is at stake .
the more the policy response has lagged , the broader the set of questions about europe ’ s future has become .
maintaining a 17-@@ member monetary union is no longer a given .
talk of countries exiting , starting with greece ( the “ grexit ” ) , is now rampant .
and only hard-core idealists dismiss altogether the mounting risk of the eurozone ’ s total disintegration .
nonetheless , many veterans of the european integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds massing over their creation .
for them , only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and , instead , catalyze the policy initiatives – greater fiscal , banking , and political union – that , together with monetary union , would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four-@@ legged platform .
but this view is not without its own risks .
it assumes that , when push comes to shove , political leaders will indeed do what is necessary – the willingness question .
it also presumes that they will have the capacity to do so – the ability question .
and , over time , uncertainty concerning the latter question has risen to an uncomfortable level .
today ’ s eurozone is beset by an unprecedented degree of rejection – on economic , financial , political , and social grounds – by citizens in a growing number of countries .
the longer this persists , the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries ’ destinies and that of europe ’ s collective enterprise .
private-sector activity is slowing , and it is nearing a standstill in the eurozone ’ s most vulnerable economy ( greece ) , where a bank run is in full swing .
elsewhere , too , depositors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy ( germany ) and to safe havens beyond ( switzerland and the united states ) .
weaker companies are shedding labor , while stronger firms are delaying investments in plant and equipment .
and global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves , shifting countries ’ liabilities to taxpayers and the ecb ’ s balance sheet .
no wonder that social unrest is evident in a growing number of countries .
no wonder that fringe political movements are gaining traction throughout the eurozone .
and no wonder that voters in almost two-thirds of eurozone countries have turned out the incumbents in their most recent elections .
all of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies – by reducing their credibility , clogging their channels of transmission to the economy , and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private-sector capital and spending .
as a result , the market-based economic and financial systems that prevail in europe , and that , not so long ago , were a source of significant strength , are losing their vibrancy .
i , too , am fond of metaphors .
during a trip to the continent last week , i heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in europe today .
the eurozone ’ s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life-threatening waterfall .
the longer they wait , the more the raft gains speed .
so the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety .
it also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome .
the message is clear .
the current crisis might indeed eventually break eurozone leaders ’ inherent resistance to compromise , collaboration , and common action .
but the longer they bicker and dither , the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity .

will europe learn to love bush ?
president george w. bush will soon travel to europe , and president jacques chirac will visit washington .
eu “ foreign minister ” javier solana has already been there , and returned bullish on future transatlantic cooperation .
atmospheri@@ cally , at least , relations have , indeed , improved since the us presidential election , and both sides have expressed good will .
yet there is little ground for genuine optimism .
bush ’ s declared intention to “ better explain the reasons for his decisions ” to america ’ s allies simply will not do .
europeans don ’ t want explanations ; they want to be consulted – to have input into american decision-making and see their concerns reflected in us foreign policy .
on the contrary , the us is continuing to thwart european efforts gradually to establish a rule-based international order .
there are no signs that the bush administration is relenting on , for example , the un , the kyoto protocol , the international criminal court , the ban on land mines , or the anti-ballistic missile treaty .
in iraq , europeans fully share the american objectives of preserving the country ’ s unity and achieving at least some modicum of democracy .
at the same time , they believe that it is up to the us to remove the chaos it created , so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substantive way .
european attitudes may seem shortsighted to americans , but it would need a lot of cajoling to change them .
there is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the israeli-palestinian conflict : the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereign states .
however , europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by bush – that palestinian democracy and not israeli occupation of the west bank is at the core of the problem – to be ill conceived .
the same is true with respect to the president ’ s assertion that israel ’ s permanent presence in palestinian territories and the non-@@ return of palestinian refugees to their homes in israel must be accepted as realities on the ground .
it may well be that such painful deviations from agreed principles will be reflected in an eventual comprehensive settlement , but pre@@ judging these issues before the beginning of negotiations denies the palestinians some of their most important bargaining chips .
on the question of iran ’ s nuclear weapons capability , americans and europeans also fundamentally agree : it should be prevented .
while the us tries to achieve this through hard power , regime change , sanctions , and threats of pre-emptive military intervention , europe uses soft power , diplomacy , inclusion , and partnership .
unfortunately , this “ good cop , bad cop ” game doesn ’ t work in international politics .
european efforts to induce teheran to renounce its nuclear designs by addressing iran ’ s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social betterment cannot be successful without active us support .
in other words , europe ’ s carrots are not enough ; a successful outcome requires american carrots , too .
by standing aside and discounting the european approach from the outset , america is merely helping to bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it would be more productive for the us to join in , at the same time agreeing with europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail .
relations with china have improved over the years on both sides of the atlantic .
china has become europe ’ s biggest trading partner , and its huge reserves of us dollars has made it america ’ s most important creditor .
despite this rosy picture , china could be the cause of a major transatlantic row if europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embargo in place since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
the bush administration is fiercely opposed to lifting the embargo , pointing out that in the event of a military clash over taiwan , us troops would face weapons provided to china by america ’ s own allies .
in fact , european assurances that arms sales to china could be controlled and threats to an ally avoided do appear unconvincing .
on the other hand , economic interdependence between taiwan and mainland china has grown to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly unlikely .
of course , this would change were taiwan to push for independence , but it would hardly do so without a nod from washington .
in short , on many of the most important current international issues , americans and europeans share the same objectives and basic goals .
where they often diverge is in the means to achieve them .
political wisdom would demand that the two sides pool their considerable resources and march together whenever possible .
this , however , requires a change of attitudes both in america and in europe .
bush must be willing to accept europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like recalcitrant vassals .
european leaders must overcome any latent anti-americanism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endeavors that would entitle them to equal partnership with the us .

will europe ’ s economies regain their footing ?
stockholm – what will europe ’ s growth trajectory look like after the financial crisis ?
for some europeans , still nervous that their economies and banking systems might collapse , this is a little like asking a passenger on the titanic what they plan to do when they arrive in new york .
but it is a crucial question to ask , especially when europe has been facing so much outside pressure from the likes of the united states and the international monetary fund to focus on short-term keynesian stimulus policies .
true , things are pretty ugly right now .
europe ’ s income is projected to fall a staggering 4 % this year .
unemployment will soon be in double digits throughout most of the continent , with spanish and latvian unemployment on track to exceed 20 % .
europe ’ s banking system remains sickly , even though many national governments have gone to great lengths to hide their banks ’ woes .
yet , ugly or not , the downturn will eventually end .
yes , there is still a real risk of hitting an iceberg , beginning perhaps with a default in the baltics , with panic first spreading to austria and some nordic countries .
but , for now , a complete meltdown seems distinctly less likely than gradual stabilization followed by a tepid recovery , with soaring debt levels and lingering high unemployment .
some commentators have savaged europe ’ s policymakers for not orchestrating as aggressive a fiscal and monetary policy as their us counterparts have .
why else is europe suffering a deeper recession than america , they complain , when everyone agrees that the us was the epicenter of the global financial meltdown ?
but these critics seem to presume that europe will come out of the crisis in far worse shape than the us , and it is too early to make that judgment .
an epic , financial-@@ crisis-driven recession , such as the one we are still experiencing , is not a one-year event .
so policymakers ’ responses cannot be evaluated by short-term measures , either .
it is just as important to ask what happens over the next five years as over the next six months , and the jury is still very much out on that .
america ’ s hyper-aggressive fiscal response means a faster rise in government debt , while its hyper-@@ expansive monetary policy means that an exit strategy to mop up all the excess liquidity will be difficult to execute .
government spending in the us has risen in short order from 18 % to 28 % of income , while the us federal reserve has effectively tripled its balance sheet .
europe ’ s more tempered approach , while magnifying short-term risks , could pay off in the long run , especially if global interest rates rise , making it far more painful to carry oversized debt loads .
the real question is not whether europe is using sufficiently aggressive keynesian stimulus , but whether europe will resume its economic reform efforts as the crisis abates .
if europe continues to make its labor markets more flexible , its financial market regulation more genuinely pan-european , and remains open to trade , trend growth can pick up again in the wake of the crisis .
if european countries look inward , however , with germany pushing its consumers to buy german cars , the french government forcing car companies to keep unproductive factories open , etc . , one can expect a decade of stagnation .
admittedly , the past year has not been a proud one for policy reform in europe .
recessions have never proven an easy time for european leaders to push forward with reforms .
matters were not helped when the czech government lost a confidence vote midway through its six-month presidency of the european union , leaving a lame duck european commission .
the shadow of forthcoming elections in germany , together with concern over whether irish voters will ratify the lisbon treaty ( giving europe a badly needed new constitution ) , has conspired to impede reform momentum .
yet europe ’ s many strengths , including strong democratic governments and sound legal institutions , are often under-@@ rated as long-term competitive strengths in today ’ s globalized economy .
the recent recession has presented challenges , but european leaders were right to avoid becoming intoxicated with short-term keynesian policies , especially where these are inimical to addressing europe ’ s long-term challenges .
if reform resumes , there is no reason why europe should not enjoy a decade of per capita income growth at least as high as that of the us .
moreover , with growing concerns about the sustainability of us fiscal policy , the euro has a huge opportunity to play a significantly larger role as a reserve currency .
one shudders to think what will happen if europe does not pull out of its current funk .
certainly , europe would lose traction as a badly needed counterweight to the us in world economic policy .
europeans may not mind this right now ( one sees more obama t-shirts in europe than in the us ) , but they might not be so happy if a george bush iii comes along .
fortunately , europeans will probably not wait so long to start moving ahead again .

will europe &apos;s financial revolution continue ?
over the last two decades europe experienced a dramatic expansion of financial markets at the expense of its traditional system of financing based on close relationships between large banks and established firms .
since 1980 the ratio of stock market capitalization to gdp soared more than 13-fold , while equity financing rose 16-fold .
in 1980 , stock market capitalization relative to gdp was five times greater in the us and uk than in continental europe ; by 2000 , it was only 60 % higher .
disclosure standards improved throughout the continent , as did laws to protect minority shareholders .
for example , before 1980 no member of today &apos;s european union , except france and sweden , had an anti-insider trading law--and in sweden the law , although introduced in 1971 , was not enforced for the first time until 1990 .
by 2000 , all eu members had anti-insider trading laws and most were enforcing them .
what caused this change ?
is it benefiting all eu countries , and will it persist as eu enlargement proceeds ?
relationship-based financial systems perform better when markets and firms are smaller , when legal protection is weaker , there is little public information , and innovation is incremental .
banks tend to have close , long-term , and protective ties with the managers of such firms , primarily because the bank &apos;s holdings are illiquid .
this can provide considerable stability--@@ indeed , the second half of the 20th century saw only four german firms succumb to hostile take@@ over@@ s--@@ but at the cost of reducing access to finance and curtailing future opportunities .
by contrast , market-based financial systems perform better when economies and firms are bigger and more formally organized , with better legal enforcement and transparency , and when innovation is constant .
a market-based system gives new firm@@ s--@@ hence new technologies--@@ more chances to obtain financing , because many investors assess firms independently .
but financial systems do not emerge as a result of their superiority in a particular environment .
vested interests distort the process of evolution .
over the last decade , trade liberalization and monetary integration supported the expansion of market-based financing in europe .
trade integration exposed domestic banks and firms to foreign competition , limiting national governments &apos; ability to intervene on behalf of favored domestic companies .
similarly , the european commission deemed subsidies to publicly-owned firms illegal if they distorted competition across member states , while the fiscal discipline imposed by the euro ended pervasive general government credit subsidies@@ --the essential lubricant of relationship-based systems .
moreover , the volume of corporate debt securities almost tripled after the introduction of the euro eliminated exchange-rate risk .
the european commission also opened up the market for corporate control by vetoing the barriers against hostile takeovers that most eu governments had erected .
but now that europe &apos;s internal economic boundaries have been mostly removed , and the political objective has shifted to political unification , integration may no longer be so market-friendly .
the more political power is centralized , the more the central authority can interfere with market development .
the pro-market bias that characterized eu policy up to now ( with notable exceptions , such as agricultural policy ) may well shift in the opposite direction .
in trade zones formed by heterogeneous states , vested interests tend to be diverse and find it hard to lobby at the supranational level .
political integration , by contrast , might have an opposite effect on the development of markets .
the threat of capital flight to nearby political entities creates a strong incentive to keep policies market-friendly , but it is suppressed when neighboring political entities coalesce .
incumbent financiers , meanwhile , have a powerful vested interest in opposing a market-based system , which favors credit evaluation and risk management over their main ``@@ skill &apos; &apos; : being well connected .
they also have the ability to organize successfully against the market , particularly in small countries , where incumbents form a well-defined group whose members often attended the same elite schools , frequent the same clubs , and inter@@ marry .
the question is not whether europe should move toward a market-based financial system . the real question is whether europe retains the political will to continue to do so , and whether eu countries can strengthen the institutions necessary to reap the full benefits of financial markets .
there is a serious danger that reforms that facilitate markets will benefit northern europe but harm underdeveloped regions in southern europe by depriving them of the relationship-based system .
in these regions , higher rates of corruption and tax evasion , together with smaller average firm size , undermine the production of credible information that financial markets need .
partly for this reason , eu enlargement is superi@@ or@@ --at least for financial markets--@@ to political unification , which encourages vested interests to lobby at the central level .
indeed , one benefit of the european commission &apos;s rule that some decisions must be unanimous is that its impedes the exercise of monopoly power , thus reducing the risk that centralized authority will be used against markets .
this is all the more important because leaders in both the us and europe are beginning to pander to the anti-globalization movement .
america &apos;s corporate scandals have undermined the market &apos;s moral standing , while the end of the internet bubble has weakened its economic credibility .
the adverse distributive effects of market-based finance may serve to further strengthen anti-market forces in europe , especially in southern europe .
the eu can buck this anti-market trend by promoting structural reforms in southern european countries and focussing on enlargement to increase economic competition .
but it should maintain a clear division of power between local and central authorities at all levels to maintain strong competition and a healthy diversity of interests .

will ex-@@ mexicans choose america ’ s next president ?
among the many surprises during the republican party presidential candidates ’ debates a couple of weeks ago was the rekindled importance of immigration .
after the failure of president george w. bush ’ s and senator edward kennedy ’ s comprehensive immigration reform effort last spring , most observers thought the matter would remain dormant until 2009 , since even touching it was potentially fatal for democrats and republicans alike .
but as democrats discovered in other recent debates , and as republicans realized with a little help from the cnn organizers , who skewed the questions toward issues they feel strongly about , immigration is an issue that just won ’ t go away .
this is one reason why i wrote a short but – i hope – useful book on mexican immigration to the united states , entitled ex-mex : from migrants to immigrants .
based on internal documents from the mexican and us governments , countless interviews , and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject , ex-mex seeks to fulfill three purposes .
first , i wanted to provide a mexican voice in the immigration debate .
mexicans make up more than half of the flow and stock – legal or not – of all immigrants in the us , but a point of view attempting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely absent from the american discussion .
of course , my book cannot be the mexican stance .
but an assessment from the vantage point of past , current , and future mexican immigrants to the us is a necessary component of the american debate – all the more so when one recalls that immigration has , in fact , not generally been exclusively a domestic us policy question .
the first american immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 – the so-called gentleman ’ s agreement with japan , while the us and mexico negotiated and administered the bracero program for more than twenty years , from 1942 thr@@ u 1964 .
and , of course , the us has had a standing immigration agreement since 1965 with a country most americans would not imagine : fidel castro ’ s cuba .
second , it is important to place the current , raging debate in historical context .
the most important feature of that context is that the actual flow of mexicans entering the us today is not much greater than the overall average figure for the bracero program period : around 400,000 per year .
it is similarly important to understand the evolution of us legislation on immigration since the 1920 ’ s , and the shifts and hypocrisy involved in the application of those laws .
for example , the 1996 immigration reforms implemented by the clinton administration , along with other , underlying structural trends , halted the traditional circular pattern whereby mexicans came and went to the us every year .
instead , they began to settle in communities farther from the border , greatly increasing the stock of mexicans in the us .
finally , the efforts of the mexican and us governments since 2001 to reach an accommodation on the issue have not been well understood .
confidential papers from the bush and fox administrations show that talks went further than previously known .
the us , and particularly then-secretary of state colin powell , was willing , as stated in a unclassified memo addressed to bush in late august 2001 , to go to great lengths to reach an understanding with mexico on the issue .
indeed , the substance of the negotiations was not much different from the content of the bush-@@ kennedy “ grand bargain ” that was fashioned in 2007 .
the electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation ’ s importance in today ’ s presidential campaigns .
in 2008 , it is likely that latinos will make up 9 % to 10 % of the electorate , the highest share ever .
they will wield decisive importance in swing states like colorado , new mexico , florida , and nevada .
having made significant inroads among hispanic voters in 2000 and 2004 , thanks to bush ’ s support for immigration reform , republicans now can barely count on 20 % of that total – mainly among cuban-@@ americans – thanks to their strident anti-immigration stance .
thus , if the democrats demonstrate a minimum of compassion , sensitivity , and realism , they can count on a 7 % advantage in the popular vote .
but doing so could cost democrats dearly in old industrial states like pennsylvania , ohio , and michigan , where the arrival of mexican migrants , transformed into immigrants , has stoked passions .
since the democrats ’ victory will most likely depend on these states , the democratic candidate who can square this circle , or the republican who can break it , may well win the presidency .

the hollowing out of the g20
washington , dc – in the run-up to this year ’ s g20 summit in buenos aires , observers have been buzzing about the meeting between chinese president xi jinping and us president donald trump .
but with the announcement that the current international bête noire , saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman ( mbs ) , would attend the event , followed by russia ’ s naval attack against ukrainian ships in the kerch strait , that meeting suddenly seems like an afterthought .
now , instead of jostling for pictures of trump and xi , the world ’ s media will be dissecting interactions between mbs , accused of ordering the brutal torture and murder of the us-based saudi journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi consulate in istanbul , and turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan .
those between russian president vladimir putin with german chancellor angela merkel – which would have been uncomfortable even without the recent attack on ukraine – will also be heavily scrutinized .
none of this is the point of a g20 summit .
what used to be an effective forum of global governance has now degenerated into a kind of kabuki theater – a faithful reflection of the extent to which the global order has lost its way .
after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 , the g20 acted as an international crisis committee , mitigating the disaster by injecting liquidity into markets worldwide .
the effectiveness of the g20 ’ s 2008 and 2009 summits raised hopes that , at a time of rapid change , this emerging platform , comprising economies accounting for 85 % of world output , could serve as a global fire brigade .
not bound by procedural rules or legal strictures , the g20 could respond quickly when needed .
there was even talk of the g20 intervening in a wider range of areas , potentially even eclipsing the united nations security council .
but , as is so often the case , as the sense of urgency waned , so did the will to tackle deep structural challenges .
important proposals , such as international monetary fund voting reforms , were not implemented .
at the same time , the g20 ’ s agenda became cl@@ uttered with issues – from climate change to gender equality – making it less a platform for action than a discussion forum , at a time when what the world really needs is a proactive and dynamic player .
to be sure , the g20 has offered a convenient framework to coordinate responses and , sometimes , to generate and disseminate innovative policy ideas , such as those relating to energy transitions and infrastructure finance .
but even that limited functionality has lately been obscured , owing largely to trump ’ s treatment of multilateral fora not as important mechanisms to coordinate international action , but rather as opportunities to project strength .
the recent asia-pacific economic cooperation summit in papua new guinea is a case in point .
sino-american competition , rather than concrete policy responses or coordination , dominated discussions , to the point that the summit did not even end with a final communiqué – a first in apec ’ s 25-year history .
similarly , at this june ’ s g7 summit in quebec , trump withdrew us support for the final communiqué , following a personal spat with canadian prime minister justin trudeau .
now , the g20 is little more than a theater of power .
images of mbs at the summit , interacting with fellow world leaders , will shift the narrative away from his actions , signaling a tacit international acceptance of his behavior and opening the way for a return to the status quo .
similarly , if the summit concludes without any unified condemnation of russia ’ s actions in the kerch strait , putin will have scored an important victory : the international community ’ s tacit acceptance of his illegal annexation of crimea .
even if european leaders offer some criticism , this is likely only to highlight deepening divisions in the event that the us doesn ’ t back them – a consolation prize for putin .
( in this respect , trump ’ s suggestion that he may cancel a planned meeting with putin because of the incident is a positive sign . )
could the hope of using the g20 summit to normalize his aggression against ukraine have informed putin ’ s decision to raise a freedom of navigation issue in the kerch strait at this particular moment ?
the deterioration of the g20 into a platform for narrow , self-serving , and image-@@ focused gambits is a symptom of a rudderless global order . with no clear impulse for reform and a lack of international leadership , the g20 is adrift .
as long as those who should be steering the ship are preoccupied with photo-ops , it will not get back on course .
this does not have to be the case .
g20 leaders can – and should – refuse to smile for the cameras and sweep everything under the rug .
their condemnation of putin and mbs will not change either leader ’ s behavior . but it will send the message that , at the very least , right and wrong still have meaning on the international stage .
the g20 is no longer an agent of action or even an agenda-setter .
the least our leaders can do is prevent it from becoming a vehicle for legitimating illegal acts .
it is a low bar , but that is where we are .

will global imbalances return ?
beijing – future history books , depending on where they are written , will take one of two approaches to assigning blame for the world ’ s current financial and economic crisis .
one approach will blame lax regulation , accommodating monetary policy , and inadequate savings in the united states .
the other , already being pushed by former and current us officials like alan greenspan and ben bernanke , will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high-savings countries in east asia and the middle east .
all that liquidity , they will argue , had to go somewhere . its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets , the us , where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights .
note the one thing on which members of both camps agree : the global savings imbalance – low savings in the us and high savings in china and other emerging markets – played a key role in the crisis by allowing americans to live beyond their means .
it encouraged financiers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more speculative use .
if there is a consensus on one issue , it is the impossibility of understanding the bubble and the crash without considering the role of global imbalances .
preventing future crises similar to this one therefore requires resolving the problem of global imbalances .
here , the early signs are reassuring .
american households are saving again .
the us trade deficit has declined from $ 60 billion a month to just $ 26 billion , according to the most recent data .
as a matter of simple arithmetic , we know that the rest of the world is running correspondingly smaller surpluses .
but once american households rebuild their retirement accounts , they may return to their profligate ways .
indeed , the obama administration and the federal reserve are doing all they can to pump up us spending .
the only reason the us trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession , causing us imports and exports to collapse in parallel .
with recovery , both may recover to previous levels , and the 6 % -of-gdp us external deficit will be back .
in fact , there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the us dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns .
whether there is a permanent reduction in global imbalances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the us , specifically in countries like china .
one ’ s forecast of those decisions hinges , in turn , on why these other countries came to run such large surpluses in the first place .
one view is that their surpluses were a corollary of the policies favoring export-led growth that worked so well for so long . china ’ s leaders are understandably reluctant to abandon a tried-and-true model .
they can ’ t restructure their economy instantaneously .
they can ’ t move workers from painting children ’ s toys in guangdong to building schools in western china overnight .
they need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving .
if this view is correct , we can expect to see global imbalances re-emerge once the recession is over and to unwind only slowly thereafter .
the other view is that china contributed to global imbalances not through its merchandise exports , but through its capital exports .
what china lacked was not demand for consumption goods , but a supply of high-quality financial assets .
it found these in the us , mainly in the form treasury and other government-backed securities , in turn pushing other investors into more speculative investments .
recent events have not enhanced the stature of the us as a supplier of high-quality assets .
and china , for its part , will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high-quality financial assets internally .
but doing so will take time .
meanwhile , the us still has the most liquid financial markets in the world .
this interpretation again implies the re-emergence of global imbalances once the recession ends , and their very gradual unwinding thereafter .
one development that could change this forecast is if china comes to view investing in us financial assets as a money-losing proposition .
us budget deficits as far as the eye can see might excite fear of losses on us treasury bonds .
a de facto policy of inflating away the debt might stoke such fears further .
at that point , china would pull the plug , the dollar would crash , and the fed would be forced to raise interest rates , plunging the us back into recession .
there are two hopes for avoiding this disastrous outcome .
one is relying on chinese goodwill to stabilize the us and world economies .
the other is for the obama administration and the fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends .
the second option is clearly preferable .
after all , it is always better to control one ’ s own fate .

will governmental folly now allow for a cyber crisis ?
cambridge – when the financial crisis of 2008 hit , many shocked critics asked why markets , regulators , and financial experts failed to see it coming .
today , one might ask the same question about the global economy ’ s vulnerability to cyber-@@ attack .
indeed , the parallels between financial crises and the threat of cyber meltdowns are striking .
although the greatest cyber threat comes from rogue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses , risks can also come from anarchi@@ stic hackers and terrorists , or even from computer glitches compounded by natural catastrophe .
a few security experts have voiced great alarm , including , most recently , jonathan evans , the head of the british security service ( mi5 ) .
by and large , however , few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so amorphous .
instead , they prefer to establish relatively innocuous working groups and task forces .
it is difficult to overstate the dependence of modern economies on large-scale computer systems .
but imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were incapacitated , or the databases of major financial systems were erased .
experts have long identified the electricity grid as the most acute vulnerability , since any modern economy would collapse without power .
true , many skeptics argue that with reasonable low-cost prophylactic measures , large scale cyber-@@ meltdowns are highly implausible , and that doom-mongers overstate the worst-case scenarios .
they say that the ability of cyber-@@ terrorists and black@@ mailers to take the global economy to the brink , as in the 2007 bruce willis movie die hard 4 , is utterly fictional .
it is difficult to judge who is right , and there are important experts on both sides of the debate .
but there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation .
first , both cyber-security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regulators can hardly keep up .
industry remuneration for experts is far in excess of any public-sector salary , and the best minds are continually bid away .
as a result , some argue that the only solution is reliance on self-regulation by the software industry .
one hears this argument for many modern industries , from big food to big pharma to big finance .
second , like the financial sector , the tech industry is enormously influential politically through contributions and lobbying .
in the united states , all presidential candidates must make pilgrimages to silicon valley and other tech centers to raise money .
excessive financial-sector influence was , of course , a root cause of the 2008 meltdown and remains deeply implicated in today ’ s continuing eurozone mess .
third , with slowing growth in advanced economies , information technology seems to hold the moral high ground , just as finance did until five years ago .
and crude attempts by governments to enforce regulation are likely to prove ineffective in protecting against catastrophe , while all too effective in strangling growth .
in both cases – financial stability and cyber security – the risk of contagion creates a situation in which a wedge can form between private incentives and social risks .
admittedly , progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social-welfare gains , which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades .
but , just as with nuclear power plants , progress can go awry in the absence of good regulation .
finally , the greatest risks come from arrogance and ignorance , two human characteristics at the heart of most financial crises .
recent revelations about the super-@@ viruses “ stuxnet ” and “ flame ” are particularly disconcerting .
these viruses , apparently developed by the us and israel to disrupt iran ’ s nuclear program , embody a level of sophistication far beyond anything previously seen .
both are deeply encrypted and difficult to detect once inside a computer .
the flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer ’ s peripher@@ als , record skype conversations , take pictures through a computer ’ s camera , and transmit information via bluetooth to any nearby device .
if the world ’ s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses , what guarantee is there that something won ’ t go awry ?
how can we be sure that they won ’ t “ escape ” and infect a much broader class of systems , or be adopted for other uses , or that future rogue states or terrorists won ’ t find a way to turn them on their creators ?
no economy is more vulnerable than the us , and it is arrogance to believe that us cyber superiority ( to all except perhaps china ) provides it with impenetrable security from attack .
unfortunately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti-virus programs .
virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race .
a virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code , compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies .
we are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred , and governments are being vigilant .
unfortunately , another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize .
let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer .

will greece go to the imf ?
washington , dc – traditionally , “ you should go to the imf ” was not something you would say to friendly neighbors and close allies .
over the past few decades , the international monetary fund became associated with excessive fiscal austerity , extreme political insensitivity , and – since the asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 – with an out-and-out stigma .
countries borrowed from the imf only under duress , when all else failed – and when there was simply no other way to pay for essential imports .
( for iceland in the fall of 2008 , for example , the only alternative to imf financing was to eat locally obtained goods , which mostly means fish . )
but the imf has changed a great deal in recent years , largely under the auspices of dominique strauss-kahn , its current managing director .
strauss-kahn , a former french finance minister and contender for the socialist nomination for the french presidency , has pushed through changes that allow the imf to lend without conditions in some circumstances , and to give greater priority to protecting social safety nets ( including unemployment benefits and healthcare systems ) .
he has also moved the fund decisively away from its obsession with fiscal austerity measures ( a big early mistake – with lasting traumatic consequences – in indonesia and korea in late 1997 ) .
greece undoubtedly has serious problems today .
t he great opportunities offered by european integration have been largely squandered .
and lower interest rates over the past decade – brought down to german levels through greece being allowed , rather generously , into the euro zone – led to little more than further deficits and a dangerous buildup of government debt .
germany and france – as de facto leaders of the european union – are haggling over a belated support package , but they have made it abundantly clear that greece must slash public-sector wages and other spending .
greek trade unions know what this means – and are in the streets .
if greece still had its own currency , everything would be easier .
just as in the case of the united kingdom since 2008 , the greek exchange rate would depreciate sharply .
this would lower the cost of labor , restoring competitiveness ( as in asia after 1997-98 ) while also inflating asset prices and thereby helping borrowers who are underwater on their mortgages and other debts .
but , with greece and other troubled euro-zone economies ( known to their detractors as the piigs : portugal , ireland , italy , greece , and spain ) having surrendered monetary policy to the european central bank ( ecb ) in frankfurt , their currencies cannot fall in this fashion .
so greece – and arguably the piigs more generally – are left with the need to curtail demand massively , lower wages , and reduce the public-sector workforce .
the last time we saw this kind of precipitate fiscal austerity – when countries were tied to the gold standard – it contributed directly to the onset of the great depression in the 1930 ’ s .
this is a situation tailor-made for strauss-kahn and the “ new imf ” to ride to the rescue .
since early 2009 , the fund has had significantly greater resources to lend to countries in trouble , to cushion the blow of crisis , and to offer a form of international circuit-breaker when it looks like the lights might otherwise go out .
the idea is not to prevent necessary adjustments – for example , in the form of budget-deficit reduction – but to spread them out over time , to restore confidence , and to serve as an external seal of approval on a government ’ s credibility .
t he imf was created in the waning days of world war ii , essentially as a united states-@@ west european partnership .
europe retains strong representation at the fund , and has always chosen its top leader – in fact , most emerging markets ( in asia , latin america , and africa ) complain that europe is overrepresented and has far too much say in how the fund operates .
yet at this moment of growing european crisis , while there is still time to act , the fund is confined to the sidelines .
this is partly because german chancellor angela merkel , currently maneuvering to ensure that a german is the next head of the ecb , does not want the fund to become more involved in euro-zone policies .
the imf might reasonably take the position that ecb policies have been overly contractionary – resulting in a strong euro and very low inflation – and are no longer appropriate for member countries in the midst of a financial collapse .
if the imf were to support europe ’ s weaker economies , this would challenge the prevailing ideology among frankfur@@ t-dominated policy makers .
but the real reason is much simpler .
when french president nicolas sarkozy put forward strauss-kahn ’ s name to run the imf , he meant to park a past and potentially future rival in a faraway place about which people cared little .
then the global financial crisis hit , and strauss-kahn was propelled to center stage .
with france ’ s next presidential election fast approaching in 2012 , the last thing sarkozy now needs is for strauss-kahn to play a statesman-like role in saving the euro zone .
we can expect to hear all kinds of misleading excuses from eu sources for excluding the imf : “ the fund is too american , ” “ europe must resolve its own problems , ” and “ the imf is not appropriate to our circumstances . ” given the magnitude of the greek crisis , they will all ring hollow .
sometimes history is driven by deep forces beyond our control , and sometimes by sheer chance .
and at other times , like now , much that hangs in the balance is affected by the deliberate , personal , and short-term tactical considerations of people running for election .
the eu ’ s leaders will try hard to keep the imf at bay .
this is not good news for greece – or for anyone who cares about global financial stability .

will greece make it ?
cambridge – greece has bought some time with a new package of financial support , but the country is not out of the woods yet .
it remains to be seen whether the sou@@ ped-up austerity policies that prime minister george papandreou ’ s government has promised will prove to be politically acceptable and sustainable .
history suggests some grounds for skepticism .
in a democracy , when the demands of financial markets and foreign creditors clash with those of domestic workers , pensioners , and the middle class , it is usually the locals who have the last say .
britain ’ s exit from the gold standard in 1931 remains the historical landmark .
having made the mistake of restoring parity with gold at a level that left the economy desperately uncompetitive , britain struggled for several years with deflation and rising unemployment .
industries such as coal , steel , and shipbuilding were hit hard , and labor strife became rampant .
even as unemployment reached 20 % , the bank of england was obliged to maintain high interest rates in order to prevent a massive outflow of gold .
eventually , increasing financial-market pressure pushed the country off gold in september 1931 .
it wasn ’ t the first time that financial probity had required the real economy to suffer under the gold standard .
what was different was that britain had become a more democratic society : the working class had become unionized , the political franchise had expanded fourfold since the end of world war i , mass media publicized ordinary people ’ s economic plight , and a socialist movement was waiting in the wings .
despite their own instincts , central bankers and their political masters understood that they could no longer remain aloof from the consequences of economic recession and high unemployment .
even more importantly , investors understood this , too .
as soon as financial markets begin to question the credibility of a government ’ s commitment to a fixed exchange rate , they become a force for instability .
at the slightest hint of things going awry , investors and depositors pull up stakes and move capital out of the country , thereby precipitating the collapse of the currency .
this movie was replayed in argentina in the late 1990 ’ s .
the linchpin of argentina ’ s economic strategy after 1991 was the convertibility law , which legally anchored the peso to the us dollar at a one-to-one exchange rate and prohibited restrictions on capital flows .
argentine economy minister domingo cavallo envisioned the convertibility law as both a harness and an engine for the economy .
the strategy worked well initially by bringing much-needed price stability .
but , by the end of the decade , the argentine nightmare had returned with a vengeance .
the asian financial crisis and the brazilian devaluation in early 1999 left the argentinean peso looking decidedly overvalued .
doubts about argentina ’ s ability to service its external debt multiplied , confidence collapsed , and before too long , argentina ’ s creditworthiness slid below that of some african countries .
ultimately , what sealed argentina ’ s fate was not its leaders ’ lack of political will , but rather their inability to impose ever-more costly policies on their domestic constituents .
in fact , the argentine government was willing to abrogate contracts with virtually all domestic constituencies – public employees , pensioners , provincial governments , and bank depositors – in order to meet its obligations to foreign creditors .
but investors grew increasingly skeptical that the argentine congress , provinces , and ordinary people would tolerate the austerity policies needed to continue servicing foreign debt .
as mass protests spread , they were proved right .
when globalization collides with domestic politics , the smart money bets on the home team .
perhaps there is another path .
consider latvia , which recently found itself experiencing economic difficulties similar to those of argentina a decade ago .
latvia had grown rapidly since joining the european union in 2004 , on the back of large-scale external borrowing and a domestic property bubble .
it had run up a current-account deficit and a foreign-debt burden that were literally of greek proportions .
predictably , the global financial crisis and abrupt reversal in capital flows in 2008 left the latvian economy in dire straits .
as lending and property prices collapsed , unemployment rose to 20 % and gdp declined by 18 % in 2009 .
in january 2009 , the country had its worst riots since the collapse of the soviet union .
latvia had a fixed exchange rate and free capital flows , just like argentina .
its currency has been pegged to the euro since 2005 .
unlike argentina , however , the country ’ s politicians managed to tough it out without devaluing the currency and introducing capital controls .
what seems to have changed the balance of political costs and benefits was the prospect of reaching the promised land of eventual membership in the eurozone , which compelled latvian policymakers to foreclose any options that would endanger that objective .
that , in turn , increased the credibility of their actions – despite those actions ’ very high economic and political costs .
the economics is not encouraging .
unless the greek economy recovers , taking on new debt is a temporary palliative that will require even more austerity down the line .
and , as long as domestic demand remains depressed , structural reforms – privatization and liberalization of labor markets and professional services – are unlikely to deliver the needed growth .
as the experiences of interwar britain – and , more recently , of argentina and latvia – show , it is the politics that ultimately determines the outcome .
for the greek program to have any chance , the papandreou government must mount a monumental effort to convince its domestic constituents that economic pain is the price they are paying for a brighter future – and not just a means to satisfy external creditors .

will hamas win the peace ?
washington , dc – for generations to come , the palestinians will remember the horrific war in gaza with pain and bitterness .
but what cannot yet be seen is how palestinians will view hamas .
whether hamas can claim a victory – and whether palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed , if a formal one is eventually agreed .
the end game – for both israel and hamas – is thus crucially important .
for the moment , hamas is perceived by the majority of palestinians as the victim of a war intended to gain its surrender .
after all , hamas was democratically elected , but was forbidden from ruling and besieged in gaza .
at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is accused of siding with israel in order to restore his lost authority in gaza .
the war exposed flaws in hamas ’ judgment .
hamas apparently did not envision a full-scale confrontation with israel when it refused to renew a six-month truce .
with gaza suffering under a lengthy siege , hamas leader khalid mashal said that there was no point in a new truce , since the old one had “ failed to lift the siege on gaza . ”
other leaders were quoted as saying that hamas would “ lift the siege by force . ”
if hamas is to survive the war , it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of gaza ’ s border crossings , especially in rafah .
for palestinians , these are signs of victory .
with open borders , hamas would secure its regime in gaza and build its popularity in the west bank , putting enormous pressure on abbas , the leader of the rival fatah movement , to accept a national unity government on terms set by hamas .
members of fatah ’ s central committee are already accusing abbas of supporting israel in the fighting , of wanting to “ return to gaza on an israeli tank . ”
radical groups within fatah are leaning toward an open alliance with hamas .
if hamas comes out ahead , abbas ’ s allies in other palestinian factions will press him to accept hamas and islamic jihad within the plo .
egypt will have to backtrack on its rejection of hamas in order to recover its image among the arabs and to reduce tensions within egyptian society .
pressure to integrate hamas into palestinian politics is also likely in some european capitals , particularly paris and london , where some expressed opposition to isolating hamas even before the war .
but if israel forces hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire , hamas ’ s image as the guardian of palestinian resistance will be severely damaged .
palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price .
abbas will be able to argue that he advised hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on israeli towns , but that hamas insisted on exposing palestinian civilians to devastation .
one indicator to watch for : the length of that ceasefire .
palestinians will recognize hamas ’ s acceptance of a multi-year truce with israel as a sign of defeat , which would also underscore palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment .
hezbollah , despite its rhetoric , has taken no steps to support hamas , and the arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat .
it is in rebuilding gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase .
abbas , supported by the united states and the european union , may have control over significant funding .
the test for him will be to deliver quickly .
hamas will also have resources for reconstruction .
qatar , a hamas supporter , has already announced an investment fund for gaza and contributed $ 250 million .
hamas will have to make a convincing case that gaza ’ s near destruction is a price that had to be paid .
many palestinians believe that israel inflicted this damage on gaza to drive a wedge between the people and the “ resistance . ”
there is a precedent for this argument : hezbollah described the destruction of beirut ’ s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the lebanon war in july 2006 .
more importantly , hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war , sharing palestinian suffering ; many have been killed , along with their families .
the biggest question is whether the war will alter hamas ’ political goals .
two weeks ago , musa abu marzouk , a senior hamas official , praised jimmy carter in the los angeles times as the only american president who had brought true peace in the middle east .
this is a radical departure from hamas rhetoric , which has always portrayed the camp david agreement between israel and egypt as a betrayal of the islamic world .
it remains to be seen whether abu marzouk ’ s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the obama administration to reach out to hamas , or whether the war convinced hamas that the two-state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with israel .

the framing of mh-17
philadelphia – us president barack obama called the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17 an “ outrage of unspeakable proportions , ” whereas russian president vladimir putin termed it an “ accident ” and a “ terrible tragedy . ”
ukrainian president petro poroshenko branded it an “ act of terrorism , ” and malaysian prime minister najib razak called it an “ inhumane , uncivilized , violent , and irresponsible act . ”
all of these descriptions may be accurate , but each carries different rhetorical weight and legal implications .
the time has come for governments and international organizations to call the attack on mh17 a probable war crime .
this rhetorical shift is needed , first and foremost , because framing the moral reprehen@@ sibility of this despicable act within a common language will help to align public perceptions of it .
as it stands , the public narrative in russia and the west diverges sharply .
russian media and officials portray the episode as , at best , a terrible mistake , and , at worst , an american plot to undermine support for the rebels .
americans and europeans , for their part , increasingly blame russia for possibly equipping or assisting the rebels .
but , by recognizing the downing of mh17 as a war crime , governments may be able to create an opening to reconcile these narratives .
whatever the perpetrators ’ underlying motives , there is no denying the moral and legal wrongdoing that occurred .
calling the offense by its legal name acknowledges this , thereby preempting a rhetorical battle to frame the attack as terror , tragedy , or conspiracy .
even the russians may be willing to accept this framing , because it avoids finger-pointing against particular actors and affirms that a court of law – not a series of media statements – will determine what occurred and who is responsible .
in fact , another important reason to characterize the downing of mh17 publicly as a war crime is that it may prove beneficial in apprehending the perpetrators .
there is a real danger that those responsible for pressing the launch button – and , perhaps , for ordering the launch – will disappear into the chaos of eastern ukraine , the vast expanses of russia , or elsewhere .
there is also a danger that the perpetrators , if found , might avoid trial if the local authorities label the crime political , and thus exempt from normal extradition requirements .
all of the relevant states in the region have accepted the legal obligation to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes .
the obligation to prosecute suspected war criminals , or extradite them to face prosecution elsewhere , becomes more compelling in accordance with the seriousness of the alleged crime .
while the full details of the attack on mh17 remain unknown , shooting a surface-to-air missile at a civilian airliner flying over a war zone is most likely a violation of the law of war – by which the ukrainian government , the russian government , and the rebels are all bound .
indeed , the conflict in eastern ukraine constitutes a non-international armed conflict ( a war between a government and rebel movement ) governed by international humanitarian law , which categorically bans the intentional targeting of civilians .
in other words , if whoever launched the missile did so with the intent of killing the civilian passengers aboard mh17 , the act was unmistakably a war crime .
even if the objective was to strike a ukrainian transport aircraft , the act likely constitutes a war crime .
fundamental to the law of war , including the law applicable in non-international armed conflicts , is the principle of distinction – the requirement that fighting parties distinguish between civilian and military targets .
in the words of the international committee of the red cross , that duty of care includes doing “ everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives . ”
in this case , many steps could easily have been taken to differentiate mh17 from a military-@@ transport plane , including visual identification ( perhaps with binoculars ) , radar-@@ signature analysis , and a check of the civilian aircraft transpon@@ der-@@ code broadcast .
if , as seems likely , these basic steps were not taken , even an accidental strike on mh17 would constitute a war crime .
a dutch or malaysian court , or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the united nations ( like the one that prosecuted the 1988 pan am lockerbie bombing ) , will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of mh17 .
framing the attack as a likely war crime now – as un high commissioner for human rights navi pillay has done – may help to reconcile the conflicting narratives that are emerging .
and , perhaps more important , doing so can play a key role in securing the political , diplomatic , and legal support needed to bring the perpetrators to justice .

china ’ s new reforms in theory and practice
hong kong – on november 12 , the third plenary of the 18th central committee of the chinese communist party ( ccp ) announced a major turn to market-oriented policies : interest-rate and currency liberalization , reform of banks and state enterprises , clearer land ownership for rural inhabitants , and a better deal for urban migrants .
behind this landmark decision was a potential crisis .
china ’ s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor , infrastructure built by state enterprises with low-cost bank funding , and government budgets funded by land sales .
but labor is no longer cheap , road construction to connect major cities has given way to building large shopping malls in small towns , and land sales based on rezoning are reaching both economic limits and the limits of villagers ’ tolerance .
cheap money with limited investment outlets now risks fueling property bubbles and industrial overcapacity .
without fundamental change , china faces slower economic growth , inadequate job creation and innovation , and popping bubbles .
the solution is a rapid shift from china ’ s export-based growth model to one based on domestic demand ; from infrastructure to consumption ; from the dominance of large state-owned enterprises ( soes ) to that of small and medium-size private enterprises ; from industry to services ; and , more broadly , from bureaucratic control to market control .
all successful asian countries have made this shift ; south korea and taiwan are models .
but rapid change entails immense pain .
soes will lose their low-interest loans , subsidized land , monopoly protection , and privileged housing .
party and state bureaucracies will lose power ( and income ) .
local governments are particularly desperate . they have huge debts , which they amortize by rezoning and selling land .
already squeezed by exorbitant property prices and popular resistance to land takings , they now face higher interest rates , property taxes , villagers empowered by stronger rights , and expensive new requirements to provide social services to migrants .
the desperation of local potentates and soe executives has created powerful resistance to reform .
at a plenary reportedly marked by acrimony , china ’ s political leaders sided with reform .
as one economic planner said , when asked about resistance before the decisive meeting , “ in the end , all of our leaders understand numbers .
the implications of the numbers are clear . ”
the third plenum ’ s announcement of its decisions took the form of a statement of broad principles , leaving many observers concerned by the lack of detail .
but the ccp ’ s role is to set the direction of policy ; executing the party ’ s decisions is the government ’ s job .
and the plenum did establish a top-level group to coordinate and enforce implementation of its decisions .
while implementation will be a long struggle , with occasionally fierce resistance , key reforms are already underway .
the current 12th five-year plan calls for annual wage increases to average at least 13.4 % ; this year , wages are rising at an average rate of 18 % , which will squeeze out industries characterized by obsolescence or overcapacity .
moreover , the government ’ s anti-corruption campaign is targeting some of the most powerful industry groups , such as the petroleum faction , thereby weakening their resistance to reform .
most important , economic outcomes are becoming increasingly aligned with the authorities ’ goals .
services already account for more output and employment than industry – the internet company alibaba , for example , is empowering both consumers and smaller companies on a previously unimaginable scale – and recent growth has been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports .
reform is not just a plan ; it is already happening .
economic openings to central asia and to asean ( specifically to vietnam ) are well underway , and reform will include further international opening .
the third plenum ’ s decisions follow the launch in september of the shanghai free-trade zone , which will open new sectors to foreign investment and permit largely market-based financial transactions and capital flows .
the liberalization of capital flows is intended to be a gradual national policy , channeled through trusted institutions in shanghai .
for trade in goods , the new free-trade zone is intended to compete directly with singapore and hong kong .
china fears dependence on those entre@@ p@@ ô@@ ts in the event of conflict .
for foreign investors , the policy will be to expand greatly the range of opportunities while curtailing foreign control ; foreign companies , for example , may hold minority stakes in the telecoms sector , while dominant foreign companies like monsanto will face constraints .
president xi jinping faces the politically risky task of pushing the ccp ’ s reform agenda against fierce opposition while the economy slows .
by emphasizing party control – through a crackdown on soes , government opponents , and critics in the media and academia – xi seeks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while minimizing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces .
above all , he is determined to avoid the fate of previous chinese leaders like hu yaobang and zhao ziyang , who lost their jobs after a critical mass of their opponents came to believe that economic and political reform jeopardized party control .
so , at least for now , china will focus on another great wave of economic reform , whereas political reform will mostly be limited to reorganization of government agencies to boost efficiency and strengthen efforts to reduce corruption .
( there have been some steps toward reform , including a decision to remove judges from local political control . )
and yet china will find it increasingly difficult to postpone stronger measures that would appease popular demands for fairness , including the establishment of an independent judiciary , which could prove to be no less an imperative than structural economic reforms .
likewise , the leaders must either accept much of the information revolution ’ s swamping of controls or engage in far more costly repression .
hopes for political reform rest on the possibility that xi ’ s second term will see the accession to top leadership of reformers like politburo member wang yang and vice president li yuanchao .
for now , however , china will focus on another great wave of economic reform .

hong kong – before china ’ s leadership transition earlier this year , experts said that the chinese communist party was intent on preventing a larger-than-life personality from assuming power .
the ccp , it was argued , wanted someone more like the bureaucratic outgoing leader , hu jintao , rather than a charismatic successor like , say , the former chongqing provincial governor bo xilai .
yet the new president and ccp leader , xi jinping , is hardly dull .
he began his term by paying homage to deng xiaoping at his statue in shenzhen , where , more than three decades ago , the former communist party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant party to free-market reforms .
in a top-level november meeting , xi set out the details of a fundamental change in economic direction , overshadowing his colleagues .
xi now leads a new economic group that will coordinate and impose his reforms on fractious colleagues .
and , unlike hu , he immediately became head of the military and now runs a parallel national security council .
at first glance , a new “ paramount leader ” appears to be emerging .
recent history explains this re-@@ concentration of power .
in 1993 , central-government leaders enjoyed relatively limited powers : they did not control the money supply and had difficulty firing provincial governors or relocating top generals .
central government revenue was low ; indeed , proportionately smaller than that of central governments in any other major economy .
this changed when then-@@ party leader jiang zemin and his prime minister , zhu rongji , centralized authority in order to stave off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to china ’ s banks .
in the process , the labor force of china ’ s state enterprises declined by 50 million , china lost 25 million manufacturing jobs , and central-government employment was slashed .
these measures saved china ’ s economy , but at the price of widespread social stress , which made zhu widely disliked when he left office .
popular reaction against the cosmopolitan , coastal , and market-oriented reforms of zhu and jiang brought to power leaders whose formative experiences were in the inland provinces of gansu and tibet .
riding a wave of resentment against inequality and social tensions , hu and his prime minister , wen jiabao , promised a “ harmonious society , ” without the stresses of zhu ’ s agenda .
they slowed economic reform and ceased political reforms .
the bureaucracy expanded from 40 million to 70 million , and power devolved to provinces , bureaucracies , and state-owned enterprises ( soes ) .
the som@@ nol@@ ent hu / wen era , fortunately , did not dampen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms undertaken by jiang and zhu .
but the economic-growth model that those reforms created was running out of steam .
low-cost exports were struggling as labor costs rose .
investment in infrastructure was shifting from growth-enhancing projects , such as inter-city highways , to less productive shopping malls in second- and third-tier cities .
productivity plummeted in soes , whose privileged access to financing crowded out private-sector investment .
local-government funding , through the seizure and resale of property , was reaching its limits .
thus , it became essential to launch a new wave of far-reaching reforms , including liberalization of interest rates , securities markets , and foreign-exchange controls , in order to fund the more productive private sector and reduce excess capacity in soes .
in particular , the reforms were needed to deflate an emerging property bubble resulting from huge savings and foreign capital inflows that had no other profitable investment outlet .
the government planned to liberalize interest rates and the capital account to encourage investment in modern , high-value industries , rather than continue to subsidize low-value exports .
it started to shift the economy ’ s base from export-oriented industries to domestic growth , and from manufacturing to services .
and it announced its intention to slow local governments ’ seizures of farmland and excessive borrowing through captive enterprises .
soes were determined to defend their privileges .
highly leveraged local governments could not tolerate higher interest rates or an appreciating currency , and they were adamant about continuing land sales and opposing property taxes .
they feared the financial burden of new requirements to provide social services to urban migrants .
as a result , a new , lean leadership team had to be mobilized .
the number of top leaders was cut from nine to seven .
the new lineup eliminated the most powerful voice on the left ( bo ) and relegated the “ extreme reformers ” on the right ( li yuanchao and wang yang ) to the second tier .
to reduce elders ’ interference , hu stepped down as head of the military and jiang zemin promised to step back .
moreover , a leading economic group was established to enforce bureaucratic compliance , as was a national security council ( similar to that in the united states ) to coordinate foreign policy .
previously , the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark ; and the party ’ s foreign-@@ affairs office , which handled north korea , often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry , which handled south korea .
an anti-corruption campaign weakened opposition , and zhu re-emerged as a hero .
this set the stage for xi ’ s arrival .
in short , the new@@ -style leadership , a form of managed charisma , was collectively designed to serve national needs .
and it implies that xi is unlikely to emerge as paramount leader .
the chinese presidency ’ s authority has certainly increased ; but xi is powerful only when he has the votes .
on contentious issues , he has but one of seven .

desperate women ’ s dangerous moves
geneva – one of the most significant recent trends in migration has been the rise in the number of women using dangerous routes previously used mainly by men .
more and more women – fleeing discrimination , violence , or poverty – are now taking the same risks as men in search of a better life for themselves and their children .
this is desperation migration .
indeed , while many women travel with their families , the international organization for migration ( iom ) is seeing an increasing number of women migrating on their own to an unknown , unpredictable , and often dangerous future .
women and children migrants are dying with increasing frequency at sea , crossing deserts , and on other hazardous routes .
what has changed ?
among the many factors pushing women to migrate are pervasive gender bias and social prejudices against single mothers or widows in their country of origin .
but poverty is almost always the strongest force driving women to leave .
in most poor countries , women are poorer than men , owing to the systematic discrimination that they face in education , health care , employment , and control of assets .
of course , most migrant women do not encounter mistreatment or die on their journeys ; in fact , many derive real benefits from migration .
but , among the world ’ s estimated 111 million migrant women ( half the total ) , violence and abuse can occur at any time , starting from the very outset of the migration process .
throughout the migration cycle , women are more at risk from physical violence by fellow migrants , smugglers , and state officers , and can be forced to exchange sex for transportation , food , or accommodation .
unsurprisingly , migrant women are often victims of human trafficking , finding themselves enslaved as laborers , prostitutes , or participants in organized begging operations .
this is true regardless of why women migrate .
when women run for their lives because of natural or man-made disasters , gender-based violence is one of the great risks they face .
displaced women , often destitute , are easy prey for criminals .
this was one of my immediate concerns when typhoon haiyan struck the philippines , and at my request a special program was instituted to alert and help women in peril .
even when women migrants find a job in a host country , it is rarely easy for them .
they are predominantly employed in domestic work , care-giving , agriculture , and entertainment – all low-paid , largely unregulated sectors that are rarely covered by national labor laws .
they are often subject to punishingly long working hours , non-payment of wages , forced confinement , starvation , beating , sexual abuse , and threats and intimidation .
many women migrants are unskilled or undocumented domestic workers .
this makes them more vulnerable to violence , because they typically depend on a single employer and in many countries face deportation if they attempt to change jobs .
moreover , social integration in a new country can be more difficult for women than for men .
this is partly because women are often subject to harmful traditional practices , such as early and forced marriage , female genital mutilation , and so-called “ honor ” crimes , enforced by families who want to maintain a link with their country of origin .
and it is especially difficult for women migrants to navigate between the tantalizing freedom of choice and expression in their host society and the traditional roles expected of them at home .
the rising number of migrant deaths – both women and men – at sea and in deserts is a wake-up call for the international community to act .
iom has called on all relevant actors – including countries of origin , transit countries , and destination countries – to address the plight of migrants attempting life-threatening journeys and find solutions .
protecting women migrants – often the most desperate of the desperate – should top their priorities .
in 2014 , the international community will review the united nations millennium development goals , which expire next year , and decide on a post-2015 development agenda .
iom believes that migrants , and in particular women migrants , who in the past have been largely invisible in the language of development , must be a part of this .
we must no longer ignore half the world ’ s migrants .
like all migrants , women on the move are entitled to personal security and basic dignity .

will nato ’ s prodigal son return ?
paris -- few state visits have lasting results .
nicolas sarkozy ’ s just completed trip to washington may be an exception , because the french president may be preparing to bring nato a highly valued present for its 60th anniversary in the spring of 2009 : france ’ s return to nato ’ s integrated military structure , from which charles de gaulle withdrew in 1966 .
in retrospect , de gaulle ’ s decision proved to be much more detrimental for france than for the alliance .
by withdrawing from nato ’ s integrated military command , france excluded itself from political decision-making within the alliance and thus became the equivalent of the “ harkis ” – the local soldiers who served with the french army during the algerian war : fine soldiers , but with virtually no reward for their service .
how realistic is the possibility of scenario french return to nato ’ s military fold ?
historically , aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the french / nato relationship , the latest being jacques chirac ’ s failed attempt to patch up france ’ s relations with nato upon his arrival in power in 1995 .
success is not guaranteed this time , either , but the chances are much higher now , because france , the united states , and the world have changed .
for starters , the us now has a real friend and ally in the élysée palace .
to speak of sarkozy as a substitute for tony blair in europe would be premature – and unhelpful , given blair ’ s inability to exert significant influence on us policy .
but sarkozy is both eager to transform france ’ s relations with the alliance and has a strategy to do so .
moreover , the french army supports such a move , while only a small segment of the foreign ministry is opposed .
sarkozy ’ s strategy is to link progress in building a common european defense and security structure with a redefinition of nato .
more europe in security terms means more alliance .
so , because sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinced european , he must normalize france ’ s relations with a new alliance based on two pillars – european and american .
moreover , financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated , while france and britain want to restart the saint-malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago .
as a result , for the sake of europe , france must move closer to the alliance .
sarkozy has also fully integrated into france ’ s approach to europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the european union following the accession of eastern european states .
unlike chirac , he understands that it is counterproductive and unrealistic to ask countries like bulgaria or romania to choose between their european or atlantic loyalties .
here , again , strengthening europe requires strengthening the alliance .
sarkozy ’ s approach may work , because america , too , has changed .
in american eyes , the kosovo war in 1999 demonstrated nato ’ s glaring and myriad shortcomings , while the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , moved america still further away from the alliance , particularly after president george w. bush disparagingly rejected nato ’ s offer of help .
former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld even tried to use divide-and-rule tactics by pitting “ new ” europe against the “ old ” europe led by france and germany , which opposed the iraq war .
those divisions are now history , and american reservations about a european security pillar cannot trump america ’ s pressing needs for allied support .
confronted with disaster in iraq , the risk of afghanistan following iraq into chaos , and the escalating crisis with iran , the us can no longer treat the nato allies with disdain .
although europe remains militarily weak , america ’ s power is now in doubt .
if a european pillar within nato is needed to strengthen the alliance , why not accept it ?
beyond the changes in france and the us , the decisive factor behind the possible reinvention of nato is the transformation of the international system itself .
aside from the explosive situation in the middle east and the threat of islamist terrorism , the west is now confronted with the rise of asia , the return of a more assertive russia , and new energy and environmental challenges .
both france and america have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively .
sarkozy ’ s trip to washington , and his address to a receptive us congress , was one more step toward ensuring that they do so together .

will next time be different ?
chicago – carmen reinhart and kenneth rogoff , in their excellent , eponymous book on debt crises , argue that the most dangerous words in any language are “ this time is different . ” perhaps the next most dangerous words are “ next time will be different . ”
these words are often uttered when politicians and central banks want to bail out some troubled segment of the economy . “ yes , ” one can almost hear them saying , “ we understand that bailing out banks will subvert market discipline .
but you cannot expect us to stand by and watch the system collapse , causing millions of innocent people to suffer .
we have to live with the hand we are dealt .
but next time will be different . ” they then use every tool they have to prevent economic losses on their watch .
the government ’ s incentives are clear .
the public rewards them for dealing with the problem at hand – whether building levees to protect houses built on a flood plain or rescuing banks that have dodgy securities on their balance sheets .
politicians and central bankers gain little by letting the greedy or careless face the full consequences of their actions , for many innocent people would suffer as well .
a sympathetic press would amplify their heart-rending stories of lost jobs and homes , making those counseling against intervention appear callous .
democracies are necessarily soft-@@ hearted , whereas markets and nature are not ; government inevitably expands to fill the gap .
to the extent that the rough justice meted out by markets or nature teaches anyone to behave better , it has consequences far beyond the horizon of anyone in power today .
when asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson , it does not take genius to predict the central banker ’ s decision .
democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important , such as finance or real estate , allowing them to privatize gains and socialize losses .
even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different , everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again .
so , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities try their best to prevent a “ next time . ”
but risk takers have every incentive to try their luck again , knowing that , at worst , they will be bailed out .
in this cat-and-mouse game , risk takers have the upper hand .
for one thing , risk takers are typically small , cohesive interest groups that , once rescued , have a powerful incentive , as well as the resources , to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status quo ante .
if risk takers were allowed to face more serious losses , they would have fewer resources to fight political attempts to constrain their risky activities .
moreover , the public does not have a long memory , a long time horizon , or an appetite for detail .
even as the united states ’ voluminous dodd-frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subjected american taxpayers to undue risk again , public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment .
why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are small , and when the details are so tedious ?
as technical experts and lobbyists took over , and the public lost interest , dodd-frank became friendlier and friendlier to the banks .
so how can this one-way betting be stopped ?
the scary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money ( as in ireland ) or the public runs out of sympathy ( as in germany vis-à-vis the rest of europe ) .
to avoid that fate , governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress , and that they can do nothing about it .
but they must try to ensure that they do not destroy incentives by doing too much .
and they must offset the distortions created by intervention in other ways .
for example , the us federal reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble , ultra-low interest rates will be maintained ( at the expense of savers ) until the sector recovers .
in the early to mid-1990 ’ s , rates were kept low because of banks ’ real-estate problems .
they were slashed again in 2001 and kept ultra-low after the dot-com bust .
and they have been ultra-low since 2008 .
senior fed policymakers deny that their interest-rate policy bears any responsibility for risk taking , but there is much evidence to the contrary .
it would be difficult for the fed to respond differently if the financial sector gets into trouble again .
but it does not have to maintain ultra-low interest rates after the crisis has passed , especially if those rates have little impact on generating sustainable economic activity .
doing so merely rewards banks for their past excesses – and taxes savers .
more importantly , if the fed wants to restore incentives for risk takers and savers , it should offset the effects of staying “ low for long ” in bad times by increasing interest rates more rapidly than is strictly necessary as the economy recovers .
this will , of course , be politically difficult , because the public has been programmed to think that ultra-low rates are good , and higher rates bad , for growth , without any consideration for the long-term sustainability of growth .
finally , the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net .
official us policy is so activist in downturns ( regardless of its effectiveness ) partly because unemployment is so costly to workers – who have little savings , unemployment benefits that run out quickly , and health care that is often tied to a job .
a stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financial-sector distress , and help bolster their claim that next time really will be different .

will olmert survive ?
after israel ’ s inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over hezbollah in southern lebanon , public pressure forced prime minister ehud olmert ’ s government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure .
how could a small militia , numbering less than a few thousand combatants , survive the onslaught of the middle east ’ s most formidable military machine ?
the commission , headed by retired supreme court judge eliyahu winograd , has just published its interim report .
its criticism of olmert , defense minister amir peretz , and chief@@ -of-@@ staff dan halutz – set forth in a detailed and meticulous 11@@ 7-page assessment – is harsh , but not surprising .
the winograd commission articulated what most israelis already think : olmert and peretz lacked the military , security , and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that raided israeli territory , killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two , and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month .
indeed , the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in israel ’ s history .
olmert , who stepped into ariel sharon ’ s shoes as leader of the new kadima party , was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian – and later mayor of jerusalem – who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas .
for most israelis , even those who voted for him as the bearer of sharon ’ s legacy after the gaza disengagement , olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister .
likewise , peretz , a rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist , surprised all when he won the labor party ’ s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury .
to many , the duo of olmert and peretz seemed to invite trouble .
precisely because israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country , they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead israel in war – but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail .
when such a moment arrived , totally out of the blue ( or so it seemed ) with hezbollah ’ s raid on july 12 , 2006 , israel ’ s two top politicians were completely out of their depth , stumbling into a war for which neither they nor the israeli army were prepared .
the military was led – for the first time in its history – by an air force general , dan halutz , who believed that everything could be solved by air power , creating a combustible combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogance .
in measured but devastating prose , the winograd commission gives failing marks to all three leaders .
peretz was unable to gauge the strategic implications of his decisions .
and halutz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full panoply of military options at the army ’ s disposal .
halutz already resigned a few months ago .
but both olmert and peretz have declared that , despite the commission ’ s conclusions , they would not quit : instead , they have vowed to implement the report ’ s many far-reaching substantive recommendations about policy , strategy , and decision-making processes .
will olmert and peretz be able to stay on ?
their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority ; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative .
but public opinion – volatile and angry – calls for both to resign : a public-opinion poll conducted after the commission published its report indicated that only 14 % of israelis believe that olmert should keep his job , while less than 11 % support peretz .
later this week , demonstrations calling for the government &apos;s resignation are planned , and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function .
there are already rumors about a palace coup within kadima , aimed at replacing olmert with either the deputy prime minister , the veteran shimon peres , or the popular foreign minister , tzipi livni .
but it does not appear that olmert will allow himself to be pushed out .
in fact , olmert ’ s weak and discredited government may yet survive .
if the government were to fall and new elections held , there are strong indications that the winner might be binyamin netanyahu , of the right-wing likud , which was decimated in the 2006 elections , but is now patiently waiting in the wings .
many who want olmert to go would still not welcome a netanyahu comeback , which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of olmert by the united states .
only a strong israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the palestinians to succeed .
as a result , the prospects for meaningful continuation of israeli-palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before .
indeed , the real loser of the 2006 lebanon war was neither israel nor hezbollah , but , at least for the time being , the peace process .

will rising interest rates torpedo stock and house prices ?
interest rates around the world are poised to rise .
short-term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1 % and 2 % , respectively , in the united states and the eurozone , and practically zero in japan - that a strengthening world economy will force central banks to tighten the monetary reins .
australia &apos;s central bank has already been raising rates since may 2002 , and great britain &apos;s since november 2003 .
in the us , the two-day federal open market committee meeting on june 29-@@ 30 is likely to mark a major turning point , reversing the steady decline of the benchmark federal funds rate since alan greenspan began loosening monetary policy in 2001 .
given the tendency of central banks to change interest rates gradually , any change of direction likely means more changes in the same direction later .
what will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes ?
in theory , when interest rates go up , there is reason to believe that asset prices will go down .
the higher interest rates go , the better are investments in bonds , which compete with investments in other assets such as stocks or homes .
higher interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these assets , which may diminish demand for them , exerting downward pressure on their prices .
when interest rates fall , the opposite effect on asset prices may be predicted .
in fact , the history of the stock market &apos;s reactions to changing interest rates is mixed .
sometimes interest rate changes have the predicted effect , sometimes they don &apos;t .
for example , the nasdaq stock price index made a spectacular 14 % jump upwards on the day ( january 3 , 2001 ) when america &apos;s fed began its latest series of interest rate cuts . a jump in the market is what one might have expected .
but then the nasdaq index fell 22 % over the following year , although the fed continued to cut interest rates aggressively .
does that experience suggest that the nasdaq index will drop sharply if the fed raises interest rates on june 30 ?
the timing of the 2001 rate decrease stunned the market .
by contrast , the fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this month , so there will be no surprise element .
the market may know , not just from the experience of 2001-2 , that interest rate movements do not have predictable effects on stock prices .
but , there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates , even though expected , can have a negative impact on home prices .
that is because home buyers are mostly ordinary people with little financial sophistication , unlike the professionals who trade in stocks .
untrained people with other things on their minds can make serious economic errors .
home values have soared to high levels in many countries as irrational exuberance grips the markets .
high home prices are already putting great stress on many families , which are struggling to make their mortgage payments .
when interest rates go up , these payments will ( when the rate is variable ) also go up , possibly becoming unsustainable .
if one borrows the equivalent of three years &apos; income to buy a house , a mortgage rate of 6 % means that 18 % of one &apos;s income goes to interest payments , which may be tolerable .
but if the rate rises to 8 % , mortgage interest payments rise to 24 % , which , together with amortization , taxes , other debts , and necessary expenditures , may claim too much of the family budget .
some will then try to sell their overpriced homes , and the resulting market imbalance will cause prices to fall .
people with fixed-rate mortgages are also vulnerable to rate increases , though less directly .
this is because if they have to move and sell their house , there may be no buyers who can afford higher interest payments , unless the home &apos;s price also falls .
by contrast , sophisticated investors , such as big stock market players , are unlikely to fall prey to this trap .
but homebuyers are not as savvy , so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it .
as psychologists have shown , people are susceptible to &quot; wishful thinking bias , &quot; wishing away possible future problems that they would rather not think about .
they may overemphasize the likelihood of economic success ( &quot; i will be making a lot more money in a few years &quot; ) and under@@ emphasize the commonplace problems that regularly challenge family budgets ( &quot; i will be losing my job or getting a divorce &quot; ) .
this blithe attitude is ultimately behind real estate bubbles where they are occurring .
low interest rates did not cause the bubbles . they only made it easier for people , in those areas of the world where there is a half-@@ believable story about a fabulous future economy , to indulge their fantasies .
interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality : the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets , a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking .
but declines in home prices will not occur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates .
after two years of rate increases , australia &apos;s home price boom only recently shows signs of abating .
dominated by amateur investors , home markets do not turn on a dime .
in places where home prices have been rising rapidly , the upward trend may continue or level off for a while .
in most high-priced places , a real decline may not come for some time .

will russia save the west ?
moscow – rapid changes in the global economy and international politics are raising , once more , an eternal issue in russia : the country ’ s relations with europe , and with the euro-atlantic region as a whole . of course , russia partly belongs to this region .
russians , on the other hand , emphasize their “ hard power , ” including military force , because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind . and , because of the country ’ s comparative lack of “ soft power ” – social , cultural , and economic attractiveness – it stands ready to use the competitive advantages ( i.e. , its resource wealth ) available to it .
internal political developments in russia are also pushing the country in a different direction from the west . quite simply , russia is moving away from democracy .
nato expansion is nothing more than the extension of its zone of influence – and in the most sensitive , military-political sphere . and yet the west ’ s unwillingness to abandon that effort is coupled with a repeated refusal to recognize russia ’ s right to have its own zone of interest .
so nato expansion has left the cold war unfinished . the ideological and military confrontation that underlay it is gone , but the geopolitical rivalry that it entailed has returned to the fore .
non-russian europe should thank the almighty for the presence of energy-rich russia at its borders , while russia should be thankful for having such wealthy customers . but the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political / security twist – witness the discussions about an “ energy nato . ”
the united states also loses . without russia , which will remain the world ’ s third strongest power for the foreseeable future , it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security .
that union should be based on a common human , economic , and energy space . the combination of a new security arrangement for the euro-atlantic community and the establishment of the union of europe could arrest the decline in the international weight of the west .

rio de janeiro – brazil has been making international headlines of late , but not for traditional stories about urban violence , natural catastrophes , political corruption , or deforestation in the amazon .
at the g-20 summit in london last april , for example , us president barack obama called for the world to pay heed to brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva , the “ most popular politician on earth , ” and shook hands with him , saying : “ my man right here .
in september , the ousted president of honduras , manuel zelaya , reappeared in the country inside the brazilian embassy in tegucigalpa after three months of exile .
although his presence dramatically fuelled the situation for a time , brazilian diplomats , working with the us , were able to reach agreement with honduran authorities to allow manuel zelaya to return to office .
then came the news that brazil will host the 2016 summer olympic games – this coming on top of hosting the 2014 world cup .
as for the global – and fortunately now abating – economic crisis , brazil has shined throughout , recording a fast and strong recovery . and , as if this good news were not enough , brazil ’ s giant state oil company , petrobrás , is already at work developing two huge deep-water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of rio de janeiro .
for these and other reasons , brazil is gaining the world ’ s attention .
brazilian democracy , at long last , is working well , following many years of military government , and its economy seems more robust than ever .
as a result , many people are enthusiastically pointing to an increased international role for brazil in the future .
but two connected and major challenges lie ahead for brazil and its government : the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nationalism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves .
brazil ’ s current success is rooted not only in lula ’ s two terms , which must end in 2010 .
the economic stabilization program enacted by fernando henrique cardoso since 1994 ( the real plan ) , first as finance minister and then as president for two terms , solidified a structure that made it possible for lula ’ s tenure to be so prosperous .
his presidency has guaranteed political stability and strengthened social cohesion .
indeed , by managing the political process to make the government work for brazil ’ s people , lula ’ s administration has made brazil a truly stable and consensual democracy .
there is nothing modest about that achievement , given brazil ’ s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed lula ’ s government in 2005 and 2006 .
lula survived those scandals and did not move to amend the constitution in order to seek a third term , though some in brazil pressed him to do so .
lula also enacted critically important social policies .
under his government , two million homes received electric power for the first time , 11 million very poor families gained the support of a minimum income ( the bolsa família ) , the minimum salary grew 45 % in real terms , thus benefiting 42 million people .
moreover , eight million jobs were created , 17 million people escaped poverty , and the income of the poorest 50 % grew 32 % – twice as fast as the income of the richest 10 % in the same period .
and lula achieved all this without triggering inflation , which he knows – perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood – wreaks havoc on the poor most of all .
this vast transformation has not only generated a virtuous circle that strengthened institutional stability and social capital .
it has also differentiated brazil from other countries in latin america , putting the country in the forefront in the region in terms of dealing with traditional social and economic injustices in a democratic way .
yet the remaining challenges are huge , for brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world – and severe violence persists .
sixty-@@ four percent of brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation , and only 22 % have electricity , a telephone , a computer , a refrigerator , a television , and a washing machine .
in the poorest region , the north and northeast , the numbers fall to 8.6 % and 8.3 % .
among the young , almost 37 % of 18-@@ 24-@@ year-olds do not finish high school .
only half the population over age 25 has more than eight years of formal education .
as for brazil ’ s international role , a subtle competition is emerging with the us .
america wants to conclude as many free-trade agreements in the region as it can , while brazil favors expanding its custom union , mercosul / mercosur .
the entrance of venezuela into the brazilian bloc , brazilian leadership at the united nations mission in haiti , and brazil ’ s role in the honduran affair are all part of this emerging competition .
if brazil is to remain on its prosperous path , it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures .
the construction of a major egalitarian , free , and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that brazil can give to the world right now .

will syria come in from the cold ?
istanbul – will the recent rapprochement between the united states and syria mark a new era in syria ’ s international standing ?
syria can hope for two major changes following the restoration of full diplomatic relations with the us .
first , it will be removed from america ’ s informal blacklist of “ axis of evil ” countries , which will substantially improve its chances to enter the world trade organization .
second , syria will probably receive the go-ahead for a pipeline to bring iraqi oil across its territory to turkey .
such a link to turkey ’ s economy – and thus possibly to the european union – would encourage syria to open its economy even more to foreign investment .
but all of this will undoubtedly come at a price .
syria ’ s side of the bargain will invariably need to be an end to its support for hezbollah in lebanon , for which it will likely seek the return of the golan heights .
israel would presumably resist this outcome , and iran – as leader of the so-called “ shia crescent ” spreading from lebanon to tajikistan – would strongly , and perhaps violently , oppose such a bargain as well .
during iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s visit to syria earlier this year , syria ’ s president bashar assad and he reiterated their unyielding cooperation in the face of “ western manipulations . ”
syria ’ s economy is a rust pile .
with a per capita income of $ 2,000 , it has been closed to the outside world until recently .
rationing is pervasive .
but , in order to secure public support , assad ’ s government has allowed for greater domestic consumption , so foreign imports are rising fast .
indeed , the country has run a trade deficit since 2005 , with no path back to balance in sight .
supposedly “ friendly ” countries like iran have been giving a helping hand , but almost always in the form of oil – and not even refined oil – rather than cash .
the effort to liberalize foreign investment has not taken up the slack in investment from the regime ’ s regional political partners .
for example , the foreign investment law of 2007 , which fixed a 15-@@ day deadline for projects to be authorized , has resulted in only $ 200 million in new inward investment .
this lack of investment has left the economy , particularly the oil industry , in a shambles .
the ruling shia elite that surrounds president assad – and that , together with the military oligarchy , retains almost total control of the economy – appears to be interested mainly in preserving the stagnant status quo .
in opposition stand syria ’ s sunni traders , who are joined in demanding a change in the rules of the game by the country ’ s various minorities , composed of two million christians , 1.7 million kurds , and 400,000 druze .
the combined economic weight of the christians – nestori@@ ans , maronites , catholic greeks , and syriacs – is greater than their actual number , and the bath@@ ist regime has always sought to accommodate these minorities .
but it was only with the accession to power of bashir al assad that they were given more economic and political breathing space .
assad has good reason to do so , because the unequal distribution of wealth , combined with an official unemployment rate of 15 % , is fueling social pressure .
the $ 3 fare for a bus ride between aleppo and damascus might look cheap to someone from outside syria , but , given that a well-trained technician may earn only $ 150 monthly , it is almost prohibitively expensive .
the second positive dynamic may come from improved turkish-syrian economic ties .
bilateral relations started to thaw 12 years ago , when syria expelled the leader of the violent kurdish separatist pkk movement , abdullah ocalan .
a turkish-syrian business council was established soon after with the hope of developing economic relations , but little impact has been felt , owing to turkey ’ s lingering suspicion of syria ’ s political alignment .
the only turkish investment was made in the textile field by the firm akteks .
last year , however , as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan pushed forward on strengthening turkey ’ s middle eastern ties , visa requirements between the two countries were eased , with cross-border car traffic increasing 22 % in five months .
regular bus lines have been opened , and , according to a high-ranking turkish bank official , “ we were hesitating about opening a branch in syria because of the us embargo , so the sending of an envoy is like a green light to us . ”
for syria , the choice now is between seizing this opportunity to open its economy , or retreating back into its baathist shell . the benefits of such an opening are clear .
the question is whether syria ’ s rulers can make the political choices necessary to obtain them .

will the bond bubble burst ?
unless inflation drops much more , now is an ideal time to be a borrower and a bad time to be a lender or investor in long-term bonds .
indeed , in many countries , exaggerated fears of deflation are keeping interest rates depressed and the cost of capital at historic lows .
the lowest rates were seen on june 13 th .
ten-year bonds in the us yielded 3.@@ 11 % , not much above the 2.1 % inflation rate of the past 12 months .
ten-year government bonds in the euro-area yielded 3.54 % , while the euro-area inflation rate was 1.9 % .
the yield in the uk was 3.86 % , while inflation was 3 % , and japanese bonds yielded 0.@@ 44 % , compared with inflation of -0.1 % .
in each case , a small increase in today &apos;s very low inflation rates would eliminate any real gain from investing in bonds .
if low long-term rates do not hold , long-term bond prices will drop sharply , leaving investors with a loss .
the history of developed-country bond markets in the last half-century is relatively straightforward .
consumer inflation increased fairly steadily ( albeit with major short-run swings ) , until the oil crises of 1973-4 and 1979-81 propelled it to historic highs in europe , north america , japan and other countries .
afterwards , the trend was reversed , and inflation declined fairly steadily .
the oil crises marked a political as well as an economic turning point .
until that time , central banks , fearing recession , were gradually losing their grip on inflation .
but public anger over sky-high price growth precipitated by the oil crises finally allowed central banks to tighten credit and smother inflation with massive global recessions .
corporate managers , meanwhile , got the public support needed to resist many cost-of-living allowances that were fueling a wage-price spiral .
the general investing public never really understood these trends .
they did not comprehend the upward trend in prices before 1980 , so bond yields , lagging behind rising inflation , were too low .
in the us , ten-year us treasury yields averaged only 1.@@ 46 % above the inflation rate between 1953 , when annual average inflation was only 0.63 % , and march 1980 , when inflation peaked at 14.@@ 66 % .
nor did the investing public fully comprehend the down@@ trend in inflation after 1980 , so long-term bond yields , lagging behind falling inflation , were too high .
in the us , yields on ten-year treasuries have averaged 4.@@ 14 % above the rate of inflation throughout the period of declining inflation that began in april 1980 .
the public &apos;s failure to recognize inflation trends meant that long-term bonds were a terrible investment until 1980 , when inflation was only a little lower than yields , and a lucrative investment thereafter , when declining inflation and high yields guaranteed large real gains .
investors are again making the mistake of pricing bonds in expectation that the downward trend of inflation will continue into deflationary territory .
indeed , today &apos;s low long-term rates suggest that investors are projecting the downward trend to continue over the next ten years at the same pace that it has done since 1980 , implying that the current us inflation rate of 2.1 % would fall to zero or below by 2013 .
is this reasonable ?
no central bank would permit deflation for long , and the current level of inflation probably represents the lower boundary that most monetary authorities consider acceptable .
at the same time , there is no such clear upper bound to inflation .
so with inflation rates near their long-term lower bound , the expectation should be for higher , not lower , inflation rates over the longer term .
the current situation in the bond markets does not reflect this because of public overreaction to the talk of deflation , with japan used as a scarecrow .
but even in japan , annual deflation has been only about 0.7 % since 1998 , and was caused by a monetary-policy error unlikely to be repeated .
japan is really the only example of advanced-country deflation in the post-1945 era .
so why should bad policy by the bank of japan set the trend for world inflation rates ?
indeed , the opposite may be the case : combating deflation could have the perverse effect of creating high inflation .
this is what masuru hayami , the former governor of the bank of japan , feared when he resisted calls for more monetary stimulus .
he was right to worry : a sharply expanding money supply may have unexpected and un@@ quantifiable lagged effects .
the kinds of heterodox monetary policy that might be used to prevent deflation similarly risk an overreaction and renewed inflation .
but fear of deflation is so widespread nowadays that if inflation overshoots the target , central banks will merely try to stop further inflation , rather than try to bring the consumer price level back down which would mean deflation .
then any inflationary monetary policy errors driven by exaggerated fears of deflation will be allowed to stand , and the cumulative inflation will offset any returns on investments in long-term bonds .
today &apos;s fears about deflation may represent a historic turning point , much as when the public mood turned decisively against inflation around 1980 .
conventional wisdom has changed , and many people will be breathing a sigh of relief when inflation rates rise above 3 % or more in the us and elsewhere .
if we have arrived at such a turning point , as the trend in bond markets in recent weeks might suggest , it will be a turning point for interest rates and bond prices as well .
the current combination of exceptionally low yields and high prices suggests that much of the world is in a bond-market bubble , and when it bursts in coming years , a period of higher long-term interest rates and lower long-term bond prices will follow .

will the eu keep faith with turkey ?
embargo 6 september 2004
more than forty years ago , turkey applied for associate membership of the european economic community .
with the association agreement of 1963 , a special relationship was established , culminating in the customs union of 1996 .
during all these years , european governments consistently confirmed turkey &apos;s eligibility for full membership , making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria .
turkey &apos;s formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights , including abolition of the death penalty , safeguards against torture , promotion of religious freedoms , gender equality , and restriction of the military &apos;s role in political life .
should the eu consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled , it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005 .
not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the eu &apos;s credibility in the world .
in many parts of europe , however , turkey &apos;s admission to the eu is viewed with skepticism owing to its size , relatively poor economy , fears of massive immigration , and , above all , cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for islam .
it would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges .
however , they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable .
negotiations with turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015 .
this period of time would offer both turkey and the union an opportunity to come to terms .
with 80 million people , turkey would be one of the largest eu states .
but the size of a country plays only a limited role in the eu &apos;s decision-making process , because political influence within the union depends more on economic power .
moreover , for decades turkey has been a responsible member of many european institutions , and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the eu .
because of its weak economy , turkey would be eligible for substantial eu assistance .
the size of these transfers , however , would depend on the eu &apos;s financial policies at the time of admission , the outcome of accession negotiations , and economic developments in turkey .
in any case , the eu &apos;s practice of &quot; capping &quot; its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by turkey &apos;s accession .
immigration should not be a cause for undue concern , either .
human mobility is limited , and turkey workers &apos; would probably be allowed to move freely within the eu only after a long transition period , possibly not before 2025 .
given the expected upswing of turkey &apos;s economy and its declining birthrate , experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point .
meanwhile , diminishing and aging populations in most of europe will have made immigration a necessity .
among the countries from where immigration to the eu is probable , turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation .
it is turkey &apos;s muslim population that creates the strongest emotions .
many feel that turkey simply does not fit into a european society based on christian traditions and culture .
it is also feared that islamists may one day turn turkey into a fundamentalist state .
unlikely as it may be in view of turkey &apos;s deeply rooted secularism , such a risk cannot be totally excluded .
but the same is true for any other democracy , where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes .
surely , the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen turkey &apos;s democratic system , which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries .
as for the eu , it must decide whether it wants to be a closed &quot; christian club &quot; or an open and inclusive society , drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity .
turkey &apos;s accession to the union would give a powerful answer , one that would be heard with particular clarity in the islamic world .
at the same time , the risks of rejecting turkey must also be taken into account : the likelihood that the reform process would collapse , bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the eu &apos;s doorsteps .
turkish eu membership presents both opportunities and challenges .
on balance , however , the advantages far outweigh the risks .

will the euro dethrone the dollar ?
much of america ’ s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar ’ s status as international money .
but american spending habits have undermined the dollar ’ s reputation , with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price .
this spring , the euro ’ s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-time high , and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves .
is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro ?
american financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles britain ’ s position in world finance a century ago .
before the outbreak of world war i in august 1914 , the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions , just as the dollar does today , and the world ’ s borrowers visited the city of london to raise capital .
the british economist john maynard keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value .
the “ future position of the city of london , ” according to keynes , depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold .
britain maintained the pound ’ s convertibility into gold at the outbreak of the great war to preserve its credibility as the international medium of exchange .
the dollar could not challenge sterling ’ s role as the world ’ s currency without matching its reputation .
august 1914 provided the opportunity .
the biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled america ’ s ability to repay its debts abroad .
fear that the us would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets .
but treasury secretary william g. mcadoo secured american financial honor in august 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else , except for the british , abandoned their obligations .
despite the dollar ’ s instant credibility , however , it took more than a decade for america ’ s currency to match britain ’ s as an international medium of exchange .
britain ’ s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the great war gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling .
the british were forced to abandon gold convertibility in april 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for britain ’ s return to the former $ 4.@@ 8665 parity with the american dollar .
six years later , in april 1925 , britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard .
but the pound had already suffered irreparable damage .
the experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency , especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it .
but even then , de@@ thron@@ ing the reigning king of international exchange takes time .
today , the euro – a currency without a country – lacks a long track record of credibility .
thirteen countries in the european union use the euro as money .
but the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of america ’ s commitment to the dollar .
the european central bank , established in 1998 , has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability .
it cannot hitch a ride on gold , the way america did a century ago .
so the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar ’ s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions .
recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instructive .
between 2000 and 2005 , the dollar lost more than 25 % of its value against the euro .
meanwhile , the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18 % to 24 % , and the dollar ’ s share dropped from 71 % to 66 % .
in short , the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of us balance of payment deficits , but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar ’ s dominance , not a revolutionary regime shift .
what might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets ?
while a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example , china – appears unlikely , a cataclysmic event , similar to the outbreak of the great war in 1914 , could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange .
in the modern era of automated payments , the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world ’ s banking system .
a catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange .
but exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question .
after all , a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect .
perhaps gold , a store of value impervious to physical distortion , could make a comeback .
of course , one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure conjecture .

will the euro survive the current crisis ?
cambridge – the european economic and monetary union ( emu ) and the euro are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary .
the euro was introduced without serious problems and has since functioned well , with the european central bank delivering the low inflation that is its sole mandate .
but the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro ’ s ability to survive in more troubled times .
while the crisis could strengthen the institutions provided by the emu , it could also create multiple risks , of which member countries need to be aware if they want to avoid them .
the primary problem is that conditions in individual emu members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be tempted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members .
the current differences in the interest rates of euro-zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break-up as a real possibility .
ten-year government bonds in greece and ireland , for example , now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on comparable german bonds , and italy ’ s rate is almost as high .
there have , of course , been many examples in history in which currency unions or single-currency states have broken up .
although there are technical and legal reasons why such a split would be harder for an emu country , there seems little doubt that a country could withdraw if it really wanted to .
the most obvious reason that a country might choose to withdraw is to escape from the one-size-fits-all monetary policy imposed by the single currency .
a country that finds its economy very depressed during the next few years , and fears that this will be chronic , might be tempted to leave the emu in order to ease monetary conditions and devalue its currency .
although that may or may not be economically sensible , a country in a severe economic downturn might very well take such a policy decision .
the stability and growth pact , which limits euro-zone members ’ fiscal deficits , is another reason why a country might want to leave the emu . in a serious downturn , a country may wish to pursue a traditional keynesian policy through large-scale , deficit-financed fiscal stimulus .
although the stability and growth pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus , a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants .
the current financial crisis raises yet another problem : the lack of a clear “ lender of last resort . ”
it remains to be seen how willing the ecb will be to provide national central banks with the volume of euros needed to play this role fully .
if a country sees its banks failing because its national bank cannot lend them enough , it may chose to leave the emu so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it deems necessary .
moreover , the current economic crisis has led to renewed talk about the need for the european union to have taxing authority .
whatever the logic of that proposition , it would open the door to much greater income redistribution .
even if officials do not want to abandon the euro , they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change .
a country that believes that monetary or fiscal policy is too tight may threaten to leave if policy is not changed .
that is clearly a substantial risk if the country is germany or france .
but even if it is one of the smaller countries , it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end .
so either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their emu colleagues to agree to their desired change in policy .
the risk , of course , is that the other countries may not be intimidated .
the threatening country would then have to choose whether to accepting a humiliating defeat and stay , or stand on “ principle ” and leave .
all of this assumes that political leaders would select only a policy change that they think will be in their nation ’ s long-term interest .
but there is also a risk that some politicians act solely out of self-interest , seizing on the economic downturn as an opportunity to get elected by promising to withdraw the country from the emu , or by saying that they will threaten to do so if the other member countries do not agree to their proposed policy changes .
none of these risks implies that the monetary union will inevitably be a victim of this severe economic downturn .
but the downturn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years .

will the imf stand up to europe ?
cambridge – as the eurozone crisis continues to deepen , the international monetary fund may finally be acknowledging the need to reassess its approach .
new managing director christine lagarde ’ s recent call for forced recapitalization of europe ’ s bankrupt banking system is a good start .
european officials ’ incensed reaction – the banks are fine , they insist , and need only liquidity support – should serve to buttress the fund ’ s determination to be sensible about europe .
until now , the fund has sycophanti@@ cally supported each new european initiative to rescue the over-indebted eurozone periphery , committing more than $ 100 billion to greece , portugal , and ireland so far .
unfortunately , the imf is risking not only its members ’ money , but , ultimately , its own institutional credibility .
only a year ago , at the imf ’ s annual meeting in washington , dc , senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole european sovereign-debt panic was a tempest in a teapot .
using slick powerpoint presentations with titles like “ default in today ’ s advanced economies : unnecessary , undesirable , and unlikely , ” the fund tried to convince investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock .
even for greece , the imf argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , thanks to anticipated growth and reforms .
never mind the obvious flaw in the fund ’ s logic , namely that countries such as greece and portugal face policy and implementation risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as germany and the united states .
as the situation deteriorated , one might have guessed that the imf would mark its beliefs to market , as it were , and adopt a more cautious tone .
instead , at the imf ’ s april 2011 interim meeting , a senior official declared that the fund now considers troubled spain to be a core eurozone country like germany , rather than a peripheral country like greece , portugal , or ireland .
evidently , investors were supposed to infer that for all practical purposes they should think of spanish and german debt as identical – the old hubris of the eurozone .
my own sarcastic reaction was to think , “ oh , now the imf thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk . ”
having served as the imf ’ s chief economist from 2001 to 2003 , i am familiar with the fund ’ s need to walk a tightrope between building investor confidence and shaking up complacent policymakers .
but it is one thing to be circumspect in the midst of a crisis ; it is quite another to spew nonsense .
the late chicago-school economist george stigler would have described the imf ’ s role in europe as reflecting acute “ regulatory capture . ”
simply put , europe and the us control too much power in the imf , and their thinking is too dominant .
what european leaders may want most from the fund are easy loans and strong rhetorical support .
but what europe really needs is the kind of honest assessment and tough love that the fund has traditionally offered to its other , less politically influential , clients .
the imf ’ s blind spot in dealing with europe until now is only partly due to european voting power .
it also stems from an “ us ” and “ them ” mentality that similarly permeates research at the top wall street investment houses .
analysts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to bet on things going well , because for the couple of decades prior to the crisis , things mostly did go well – very well .
that is why , for example , so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner .
but the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line .
in his recent speech in jackson hole , wyoming , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke forcefully complained that political paralysis has possibly become the principal impediment to recovery .
but analysts accustomed to working on emerging markets understand that such paralysis is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis .
rather than slavishly believing policymakers ’ assurances , emerging-market researchers have learned to be cynical about official promises .
all too often , everything that can be done wrong will be done wrong .
the imf needs to bring much more of this brand of skepticism to its assessment of eurozone debt dynamics , instead of constantly seeking strained assumptions that would make the debt appear sustainable .
anyone looking closely at europe ’ s complex options for extricating itself from its debt straightjacket should realize that political constraints will be a huge obstacle no matter which route europe takes .
even outside europe , the imf has long given too much credence to sitting governments , rather than focusing on the long-term interests of the country and its people .
the fund is doing europe ’ s people no favor by failing to push aggressively for a more realistic solution , including dramatic debt write-downs for peripheral eurozone countries and re-@@ allocating core-country guarantees elsewhere .
now that the fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many european banks , it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis , a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform .
europe ’ s future , not to mention the future of the imf , depends on it .

will the iraq war kill globalization ?
the un and nato are widely perceived as damaged , if not broken , by their failure to agree on what to do about iraq .
will these cracks in the international political system now wound the world &apos;s economic architecture , and with it globalization , as well ?
international economic agreements have never been easy to make .
reaching consensus among the world trade organization &apos;s 145 members , where one dissent can cause utter disarray , was difficult even before the world &apos;s governments divided into pro- and anti-american camps .
indeed , multilateral trade agreements were being eclipsed by bilateral deals , such as between the eu and various developing countries , long before the divisions over iraq appeared .
of course , the problem goes deeper and not everything that touches globalization has turned dark .
immigration controls , for example , have been relaxed in several european countries ( notably germany ) due to declining populations and educational shortcomings .
but bad economic times are rarely moments when governments push bold international economic proposals .
economic fragility among the world &apos;s leading economies is the biggest stumbling block .
the us and the eu have few fiscal and monetary levers left to combat weak performance .
short-term interest rates in the us , at 1.25 % , are at a 40-year low .
congress has pared $ 100 billion from the bush administration &apos;s 10-year $ 726 billion tax cut plan , and the us &apos;s projected 10-year $ 2 trillion budget deficit will grow as the iraq war &apos;s costs mount , with president bush submitting a supplemental request for $ 80bn ( 0.8 % of gdp ) in extra military spending this year .
such spending risks absorb productive resources that could be employed more efficiently elsewhere .
this was demonstrated by the rapid growth of output and incomes that followed the arrival of the so-called &quot; peace dividend &quot; which came with the cold war &apos;s end .
moreover , others ( arab countries , germany , and japan ) will not cover america &apos;s military costs , as in the 1991 gulf war .
we are now back to the more usual situation where war is financed by government debt , which burdens future generations unless it is eroded by inflation .
but the european central bank remains reluctant to ease monetary policy .
in japan , there seems little hope that the world &apos;s second-largest economy can extricate itself from its homemade deflation trap to generate the demand needed to offset economic weakness elsewhere in the world .
four years of deflation and a drawn-out banking crisis offer little prospect of economic stimulus .
higher oil prices and lower trade turnover aggravate the problem .
oil prices have flirted with their highest level since the gulf war and will go higher if iraq &apos;s oil infrastructure ( or that of neighboring countries ) is damaged .
the adverse effects on growth will be felt everywhere , but nowhere more , perhaps , than in the energy-dependent south korea and china .
although china &apos;s official growth rate reached 8 % in 2002 , its high budget deficit and large stock of non-performing loans ( about 40 % of gdp ) mean that it cannot afford any slowdown if it is to keep people employed , especially in rural areas .
some poor economies will be directly damaged by the loss of the iraq market , which accounts for roughly 40 % of vietnam &apos;s tea exports and 20 % of its rice exports .
for others , weakness in the world &apos;s big economies may be compounded by political risks .
turkey has suffered from rising oil prices , falling tourism income ( its second-largest source of foreign exchange ) , and declining foreign investment .
now the erdogan government &apos;s lukewarm support for us policy on iraq exposes turkey to doubts about america &apos;s commitment to its economic well being , and global markets may question its ability to service its $ 100 billion public-sector debt in 2003 and 2004 .
the test of whether multilateral cooperation can be put back on track , and reconciled with america &apos;s war against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , may come with iraq &apos;s reconstruction .
with the costs of ousting saddam hussein and occupying iraq likely to run at anywhere from $ 100 to $ 600 billion over the next decade , the us will want to &quot; internationalize &quot; iraq &apos;s reconstruction .
iraq &apos;s $ 20 billion annual oil revenues cannot meet such costs .
indeed , those revenues will scarcely cover the costs of rebuilding basic infrastructure , feeding and housing displaced populations , and paying for the country &apos;s civil administration .
after the ouster of the taliban last year , the $ 4.5 billion of reconstruction aid pledged to afghanistan &apos;s new government demonstrated that a multilateral approach to reconstruction is possible .
but the poisoned atmosphere that followed the un debates on iraq may prevent the us from getting its way here .
already , french president jacques chirac has promised to veto any security council resolution on reconstruction that seeks to justify the war .
if the world economy is to recover , the diplomatic failures and name-calling must end .

will the meek inherit russia ?
moscow – in a recent interview , russia ’ s president dmitri medvedev proclaimed that he wants a second term in office following the 2012 election , but that he would not run against prime minister vladimir putin , who put him in power in the first place .
such a rivalry , medvedev implied , would damage the country ’ s well-being and image .
medvedev ’ s statement should end speculation about whether he is running , yet it keeps the suspense alive regarding putin , whose influence is far greater than that of russia ’ s meek president .
many , particularly in the west , would like to see putin and his prickly , anti-western authoritarianism pass from the scene .
indeed , over the last ten years , russian foreign policy has been animated by defensiveness and suspicion .
russia even has uneasy relations with the congenitally non-threatening european union .
it is tou@@ chy about the independence of the near-abroad countries , especially those politically or geographically close to the west – belarus , moldova , ukraine , and georgia .
more than a decade after the fact , the kremlin still decries nato ’ s eastward enlargement as a security threat .
the reality , of course , is that nato is as much of an offensive threat to russia as switzerland is .
but it is not nato ’ s military power that putin ’ s kremlin finds alarming ; the real threat is the alliance ’ s potential to “ swallow ” moldova or ukraine at some point .
creating a precedent for the democratization of post-soviet space is a nightmare scenario for putin and his cronies .
as in soviet times , the main task of today ’ s ruling elite – putin and his former kgb associates – is to preserve their tight-knit political and economic regime , built for their personal control and material benefit .
russian foreign policy is , as it was under the soviets , an extension of official domestic priorities .
the current regime is clearly autocratic .
yet it aspires to democratic legitimacy in the eyes of russian citizens and the international community .
it is to this end that medvedev performs his civilizing mission – participating in world forums , posting twitter updates , berating rampant corruption , and supporting “ modernization ” and the “ rule of law . ”
the result of this duality – authoritarian establishment and potemkin village democratic façade – is that russia occupies a unique geopolitical no man ’ s land .
a democratic russia would want to catch up with the west and integrate into western institutions .
yet this is not in the group interests of putin ’ s backers , the people who run , and own , russia : its security , military , and industrial complex .
of course , these people have been personally integrated into europe for two decades now – their money is in european banks ; their holiday villas are in the south of france , tuscany , and the greek isles ; their children are educated in the po@@ sh@@ est boarding schools .
so , despite the current regime ’ s tough , often anti-western rhetoric , they are not at all interested in closing russia off from the west .
what they want is to prevent the integration with the west of russia itself , for that would mean the end of their regime .
but , to sustain the charade of a strong and prosperous russia , standing against the predations and hypocrisy of the west , the regime cannot be as authoritarian as putin himself might wish .
if it were , swiss banks and international organizations would close their doors .
so the regime ’ s backers have a strong interest in maintaining its “ democratic ” side .
the west , despite its years of experience in dealing with the soviets , is still a sucker for such janus-like behavior , especially now , when medvedev presents such an endearing democratic face .
in june , speaking at the st. petersburg economic forum , medvedev mesmerized his audience by simultaneously sounding avant-garde and hackneyed : he attacked corruption , vowed that russia is not “ building state capitalism , ” and promised legal and federal reforms .
decisions , he said , should be left to business or made locally , not in the kremlin .
the st. petersburg economic forum is mostly for international consumption .
if western bankers and investors want to buy snake oil , that is their business .
but no one should leave such events thinking that anything medvedev says means that russia is changing .
us vice president joe biden , usually a sharp critic of russia , arrived in moscow in march , supposedly to convince putin to surrender his presidential ambitions for 2012 .
a month later , talking to putin by phone , biden invited him to visit washington , though , according to russia ’ s constitution , the prime minister has no foreign-policy role .
does the united states support putin in the elections , or , by recognizing putin ’ s historic importance , do the americans mean to convince him to leave power ?
no one knows .
until russia ’ s internal political situation changes , relations with the west will remain unchanged and ambiguous .
putin , however , would be well advised to listen to biden , who is rumored to have offered him important international positions , such as chairing the international olympic committee , or perhaps even leading the united nations .
after all , putin knows well the old soviet playbook : the fate of previous kgb functionaries may await him .
dreaded secret-police chief lavrenti beria , who operated the machinery of repression under joseph stalin , was executed by the system he perfected , after being sentenced to death in 1953 for “ spying against the state . ”
in his decade in power , putin has consolidated and strengthened the security forces , intimidated and jailed opponents , and muzzled the media and courts .
if he doesn ’ t step down or aside so that russia can move forward , the system he has created may turn his own methods against him .

will the next democratic revolution be egypt ’ s ?
responses to america ’ s call for democracy in the middle east have been tepid at best .
arab governments feel provoked by president george w. bush , particularly as he announced his initiative with little regional consultation .
seeking to pre-empt american action , egypt backed a counter-proposal , the alexandria declaration , at an arab league summit last may , and followed this with president hosni mubarak ’ s recent announcement that he will allow opposition candidates to challenge him for the presidency .
is this just another stalling tactic , or an opening to real reform ?
what is clear is that the recent elections in iraq and palestine , together with the swelling protests against syria ’ s distorting influence on lebanon ’ s democracy , have reinvigorated debate about political reform within egypt .
members of the opposition have argued that the country is compelled to reform itself if it is not to have reform imposed from abroad .
going further , the managing director of one newspaper claims that delaying political and constitutional reform as if it were a grant to citizens – rather than their right – would invite outside intervention in egypt ’ s domestic affairs .
arab democracy , he claims , has now become a domestic concern in the united states , which will make it hard for american presidents to sweep the abuses of friendly arab regimes under the rug , as they did in the past .
in the arab world , authoritarian governments have deprived people of political , civil , and intellectual freedoms for decades .
for young citizens , particularly islamists , normal channels of political participation have been closed off .
as a result , they have gravitated towards underground extremist movements .
poverty , cronyism , and official corruption heighten this popular frustration .
in this climate , the momentum for political and constitutional reform in egypt is gathering pace .
there is great nostalgia for the last liberal experiment ( from the 1920 ’ s until the 1952 revolution ) , which was a model for other arab countries .
egypt ’ s vibrant political life , press , and liberal culture were then supported by an ideology of secular nationalism and improved religious harmony .
there was a vibrant multiparty parliamentary democracy , with an independent judiciary and one of the world ’ s earliest movements for female emancipation .
the achievements and aspirations of that liberal experiment today unite egyptians who favor reform .
they have even inspired the birth of a new political party , hizb al ghad ( the party of tomorrow ) , founded by a young parliamentarian committed to democratic reform .
the party denies the argument that democracy will foster islamic extremism and claims that it is the delay of reform that presents a major source of danger .
hizb al ghad recently produced a 48-@@ page draft constitution , aimed at reviving egypt ’ s stagnant political life .
its preamble , which opens with the phrase “ we , the egyptian people , ” can be read as a scathing attack on egypt ’ s current political order , and calls for an end to fear and despotism .
among the document ’ s proposals is an end to the emergency rule imposed since president anwar sadat ’ s assassination in 1981 .
that seemingly endless “ emergency ” has resulted in the severe restriction , or even suspension , of individual and political liberties .
other provisions include curbing the far-reaching powers granted to the president in the 1971 constitution and introducing direct presidential elections with multiple candidates .
the draft constitution would transform egypt into a parliamentary republic .
the dominant national democratic party ( ndp ) takes a different view , arguing that political change can be achieved without constitutional reform .
the ndp appears to believe that democratization must begin with changing the political culture and instilling democratic values .
these steps would precede concrete legal and constitutional reforms , such as those proposed by hizb al ghad .
so far , however , the ndp has missed every opportunity imaginable to gain popular support by proposing a reform program designed to bring real increases in public participation .
this is one reason why mubarak ’ s call to hold a multi-@@ candidate presidential election failed to galvanize egypt ’ s electorate .
the government , indeed , prefers to offer only hollow initiatives focused narrowly on the economy .
the conflict between the two visions of reform should not obscure the fact that there is a general consensus in egypt : substantial reform of some kind is necessary and long overdue .
most importantly , liberal voices in egypt are not merely a response to us democratic initiatives .
they are a homegrown challenge to an entrenched political order , and they are riding a powerful historical current .

will the polluters pay for climate change ?
i am writing this in new york in early august , when the mayor declared a “ heat emergency ” to prevent widespread electricity outages from the expected high use of air conditioners .
city employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees fahrenheit ( 25.5 celsius ) .
nevertheless , electricity usage has reached near-record levels .
meanwhile california has emerged from its own record-breaking heat wave .
for the united states as a whole , the first six months of 2006 were the hottest in more than a century .
europe is experiencing an unusually hot summer , too .
july set new records in england and the netherlands , where weather data go back more than 300 years .
the hot northern summer fits well with the release of an inconvenient truth , a documentary film featuring former us vice-president al gore .
using some remarkable graphs , images , and other information , the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming , or , at the very least , contributing to it , and that we must urgently address the issue .
americans tend to talk a lot about morality and justice .
but most americans still fail to realize that their country ’ s refusal to sign the kyoto protocol , and their subsequent business – as-usual approach to greenhouse gas emissions , is a moral failing of the most serious kind .
it is already having harmful consequences for others , and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change , while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs .
( to see what you can do to reduce your own contribution , go to www.climatecrisi@@ s.@@ net@@ . )
to see the inequity , i merely have to glance up at the air conditioner that is keeping my office bearable .
while i ’ ve done more than the mayor requested , setting it at 82@@ f ( 27@@ c ) , i ’ m still part of a feedback loop .
i deal with the heat by using more energy , which leads to burning more fossil fuel , putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more .
it even happened when i watched an inconvenient truth : on a warm evening , the cinema was so chilly that i wished i had brought a jacket .
heat kills .
a heat wave in france in 2003 caused an estimated 35,000 deaths , and a hot spell similar to the one britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths , according to official estimates .
although no particular heat wave can be directly attributed to global warming , it will make such events more frequent .
moreover , if global warming continues unchecked , the number of deaths that occur when rainfall becomes more erratic , causing both prolonged droughts and severe floods , will dwarf the death toll from hot weather in europe .
melting polar ice will cause rising seas to inundate low-lying fertile delta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their food .
tropical diseases will spread , killing still more people .
overwhelmingly , the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt , to find alternative sources of food , and who do not have access to health care .
even in rich countries , it usually isn ’ t the rich who die in natural disasters .
when hurricane katrina hit new orleans , those who died were the poor in low-lying areas who lacked cars to escape .
if this is true in a country like the us , with a reasonably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis , it is even more evident when disasters strike developing countries , because their governments lack the resources needed , and because , when it comes to foreign assistance , rich nations still do not count all human lives equally .
according to united nations figures , in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the us were 16 times higher than in india , 60 times higher than in bangladesh , and more than 200 times higher than in ethiopia , mali , or chad .
other developed nations with emissions close to those of the us include australia , canada , and luxembourg .
russia , germany , britain , italy , france , and spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the us .
this is still significantly above the world average , and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warming .
if a polluter harms others , those who are harmed normally have a legal remedy .
for example , if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that i use to irrigate my farm , killing my crops , i can sue the factory owner .
if the rich nations pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide , causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns , or my fields are inundated by a rise in the sea level , shouldn ’ t i also be able to sue ?
camilla toulmin , who directs the international institute for environment and development , a london-based ngo , was present at a lecture on climate change that al gore gave in june .
she asked him what he thought about compensation for those who are hit hardest by climate change , but who have done the least to cause it .
the question , she reports on www.opendemocracy.net , seemed to take him by surprise , and he did not support the idea .
like toulmin , i wonder if this is a truth that is just too inconvenient , even for him .

will the rumsfeld revolution continue ?
america ’ s defense policy is at a crossroads .
since 1997 , the united states congress has required the department of defense to undertake a major defense review every four years .
the department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year .
the review promises to be nothing short of a watershed .
the last quadrennial defense review was published a few weeks after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . as a result , it gave only hints of the counterterrorism strategy to come .
the 2005 review , by contrast , will represent several years of thinking by the bush administration , and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of american defense policy .
the grand strategy that serves as the foundation for american defense policy has not undergone major change since 2002 .
focusing on terrorism , the strategy calls for strengthening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism , and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsors .
ultimately , it seeks to address what president bush considers the root causes of terrorism , particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity .
what is changing is the way that us military power is used to implement this grand strategy .
there is little doubt that the 2005 defense review will formalize the change in focus underway since september 11 , 2001 .
before that , the american military concentrated on swift victory in a major theater war against another state ’ s military forces .
today , however , the us military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states , assist partners in countering insurgency and terrorism , control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse , or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their supporters .
this requires a different type of force , and one capable of running a marathon rather than a sprint , sustaining major deployments for extended periods .
the global configuration of america ’ s military is also changing .
the goal is to keep most of the force stationed at home in the us , with a network of light@@ ly-@@ manned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war .
rather than being miniature americas , many of these bases will be operated in conjunction with or by the host nation .
this will capitalize on the us military ’ s ability to project force around the world quickly , while providing a more flexible and politically palatable way of doing so .
but , beyond the ongoing changes , major strategic questions persist .
first , how much conventional war-@@ fighting capability should the us military retain ?
the goal is to maintain enough to deter aggressors , but not so much that it detracts from other , more likely missions .
second , what will america ’ s relationship with its traditional allies be ?
will formal alliances such as nato remain the centerpiece of american strategy , or will they be superseded by mission-@@ specific coalitions ?
third , how much should the us continue to invest in advanced , high-tech weapons more appropriate for conventional enemies than for fighting terrorists or insurgents ?
systems such as the f / a-22 raptor aircraft and the army ’ s future combat system are extraordinarily expensive .
at a time when deployments to iraq and afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military ’ s existing equipment needs repair or replacement , questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment .
fourth , what is the appropriate size of the us military ?
many defense intellectuals , former military leaders , and politicians believe that america ’ s military , particularly the ground forces , are too small to implement bush ’ s grand strategy .
secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , on the other hand , believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re-organized for maximum efficiency . he is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will diminish funds available for advanced technology and systems .
because rumsfeld is the primary architect of the upcoming defense review , it is very unlikely to recommend an increase in the size of the force .
the changes underway in american defense policy reflect planning assumptions .
the strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate .
the upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years , focusing especially on iraq , afghanistan , and other aspects of the war on terror .
the question is whether future american military missions will replicate those of the past five years .
if not , the us might be preparing for the last war rather than the next one .
one hopes that the 2005 defense review will address this issue , although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate .
in any case , the new review will serve as a roadmap for future us defense policy , thus affecting america ’ s partners and adversaries alike .

will the sun still rise ?
tokyo – the scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march was far greater than even the authorities ’ worst scenarios foresaw .
nearly six months later , the total damage remains difficult to estimate .
social unrest and confusion , as well as radiation leaks from the fukushima nuclear power plant , continue .
and now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another downgrade of its bond ratings .
both moody ’ s and standard &amp; poor ’ s now rate japanese bonds at only their fourth-highest level .
so what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows ?
last year , japan ’ s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3 % annual rate , higher than in the united states or the european union , owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of lehman brothers in 2008 .
but growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake .
indeed , the economy shrank by 3.5 % year on year in the first quarter .
now , with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami , the economy ’ s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2 % of gdp .
but that may not be a bad thing : prior to the earthquake , japan had a demand-supply gap of approximately 5 % of gdp .
while reducing this gap to 3 % of gdp has led to higher prices , this is exactly what japan needs after years of persistent deflation .
meanwhile , higher public spending on capital investment and other special procu@@ rements will boost domestic demand .
the hanshin earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2 % of gdp .
this time , the loss is estimated at 3.4 % of gdp , implying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursued .
on the downside , confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit , mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages .
according to the japan center for economic research , power-@@ supply disruptions could negatively affect the japanese economy for the next three years .
if the tokyo metropolitan area ’ s power supply were to decrease by 10 % this year , for example , japan ’ s gdp would fall by 2 % .
soon after the disaster , the government announced that reconstruction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recovery .
i think this view is too optimistic , because i suspect that the government wants to finance its new expenditure with a tax hike .
moreover , the extremely sharp contraction in first-quarter gdp may indicate that the disaster ’ s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected .
indeed , the economy is expected to have shrunk by another 2.6 % year on year in the second quarter , with growth set to resume only in july-september .
and , contrary to the government ’ s outlook , the start of economic recovery could be delayed until the end of this year , with medium-term annual growth reaching 1.5@@ - 2 % .
a key question has been the disaster ’ s impact on global supply chains .
according to japan ’ s ministry of economy , trade , and industry , which surveyed firms roughly a month after the earthquake , more than 60 % of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of april 15 .
almost 30 % expected to recover by the summer , and the remaining 10 % foresaw normal operations after the autumn .
but the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant , particularly for the asia-pacific region .
consider renesas electronics , a medium-size company , with ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) in annual sales , which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro-@@ computing components for automobiles .
partly as a result of the damage at renesas , toyota ’ s capacity-utilization rate dropped to 50 % at the beginning of may .
likewise , the chemical manufacturer kureha ( ¥ 130 billion in annual sales ) has a 70 % share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium-ion batteries – a small but essential component of cell phones .
nokia in finland , for example , imports 12 % of its cell-phone components from japan , and thus could be indirectly affected by the disaster .
as a result , more companies are likely to create and implement business continuity plans . indeed , “ bc@@ p ” is set to become a key term in the region ’ s economic discourse .
using bc@@ ps to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form , with companies establishing cooperative relationships even with their competitors .
unfortunately , japan ’ s public officials appear incapable of similar flexibility .
the disaster confirmed the traditional view of japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration .
the government ’ s mistakes in so-called “ risk communication ” regarding the fukushima nuclear plant , and its slowness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster , have once again put the stereotype on full display .
in terms of international relations , however , the disaster could improve japan ’ s bilateral ties with influential countries .
for example , chinese premier wen jiabao and south korean president lee myung-bak met with outgoing japanese prime minister naoto kan in fukushima , near the damaged plant – helping to ease neighboring countries ’ concerns about radiation leakage .
moreover , japan ’ s relations with the us , which had suffered since the democratic party of japan came to power two years ago , appear to have emerged from the disaster stronger than ever .
japan ’ s self-defense forces played an important role in rescue and restoration activities , with about half of its 200,000 personnel dispatched to the damaged area .
while this severely weakened japan ’ s defenses , the us ensured east asia ’ s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cru@@ is@@ ers , and american forces also searched for missing victims together with the jsdf .
but japan ’ s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and normalization , and for that , stronger political leadership is needed .
the earthquake and tsunami have confronted japan with a profound crisis – but also with a rare opportunity to undertake the comprehensive reforms that the country has postponed for far too long .

will the us have a “ debt crisis ” ?
washington , dc – john boehner , speaker of the united states house of representatives , is leading the republican party ’ s charge on fiscal policy , arguing that his side needs to see “ trillions of dollars ” in spending cuts in order for congress to approve an increase in the us government ’ s debt ceiling .
but framing the issue this way creates a major problem for boehner : it will directly , completely , and quickly antagonize one of the republicans ’ most important constituencies – the us corporate sector .
focusing on the debt ceiling creates a political trap for boehner and the republicans .
it is true that the us treasury ’ s ability to borrow will reach its legally authorized limit in early august .
it is also true that whenever republicans rattle their sabers about the debt ceiling , and threaten not to raise it , the bond market yawns and there is no significant impact on yields .
if the republicans ’ threats were credible , any news that increased the likelihood of a problem with the debt ceiling would send treasury bond prices down and yields up .
this is not happening , because bond traders cannot imagine that the republicans would be able – or even willing – to follow through .
the entire credit system in the us – and in much of the rest of the world – is based on the notion that there are “ risk-free assets , ” namely us government securities .
there is no provision in the us constitution to guarantee that the us will always pay its debts , but the american republic has proven itself for 200-plus years to be about as good a credit risk as has ever existed .
us fiscal resolve has been tested at least five times : at independence , in the war of 1812 , during and after the civil war , and in world war i and world war ii .
we can debate the exact fiscal pressures in each case , and precisely how various kinds of bondholders were treated , but the simple fact of the matter is that when the going gets tough , the us pays its debts .
at least in the near term , the chance that the us will not service its debt is vanishingly small – perhaps in the same order of probability as a large meteor striking the earth .
to be sure , there are big fiscal questions to be sorted out – including how much the government should spend and on what , as well as how much tax it should collect and by what means .
there is also the vexing question of how much debt is too much for the modern us .
in a world where international investors ( from both the private and official sectors ) routinely wring their hands about us fiscal deficits – and then go out and buy more us government debt – who knows the answer ?
countries never default because they can ’ t pay their debts ; there are always ways to decrease expenditures or raise taxes .
countries default because their political processes bring them to the point where the people in power decide , for whatever reason , not to pay the government ’ s debts .
it is not difficult to identify who would bear what costs if the us did not pay – or if it disrupted markets by not increasing its debt ceiling .
everyone who borrows or interacts with the credit system in any way would suffer a shock that would make the crisis of 2008 look small .
among others , the us corporate sector – big and small business – would be livid .
to be sure , executives and entrepreneurs like to shake their heads over the current us fiscal deficit .
and some of them engage constructively in debates about the real issues : how to control health-care costs , prevent future financial crises , and end america ’ s expensive foreign wars .
but these are the issues for the presidential election of 2012 , in which one hopes for debates that will set a more encouraging fiscal agenda for the next 20-30 years .
how and when america ’ s budget problems will be resolved is unknown , but us fiscal history is encouraging – the republic has managed and survived crisis before .
simply put , america will not score an own goal over the debt ceiling – and boehner must know it .
symbolic gestures are to be expected , as with the threatened government shutdown earlier this year , which merely created fodder for political advertising by both parties .
but any manufactured debt crisis now would deeply antagonize the corporate sector – and most of the electorate .
in the wake of economic disaster , the party held responsible would presumably be exiled from power for a generation ( the great depression kept the republicans from the us presidency for 20 years ) .
the republican leadership is making threats that are not credible .
if barack obama ’ s administration plays its hand well , the result will be a last-minute extension of the debt ceiling with no significant concessions .
it is unclear how boehner or anyone else would be able to portray that as a political victory .

will the us-japan alliance survive ?
cambridge – next year marks the 50th anniversary of the united states-@@ japan security treaty , a central feature of stability in east asia for half a century .
but now , with the japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty , and north korea ’ s nuclear tests and missile launches increasing their anxiety , will japan reverse its long-standing decision not to seek a national nuclear-deterrent capability ?
is the us-japan alliance coming to an end ?
in the early 1990 ’ s , many americans regarded japan as an economic threat .
some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a cold war relic to be discarded .
these trends were reversed by the clinton administration ’ s 1995 “ east asia strategy report . ”
in 1996 , the clinton-hashimoto declaration stated that the us-japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post-cold war east asia .
that approach has continued on a bipartisan basis in the us , and polls show that it retains broad acceptance in japan .
most close observers of the relationship agree that the us-japan alliance is in much better shape today than 15 years ago .
nonetheless , the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environment .
one is north korea , whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive .
the north koreans have violated their agreements , knowing that china , the country with the greatest potential leverage , is most concerned about regime collapse in north korea , and thus the threat of chaos on its borders .
japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world , but it relies on america ’ s extended nuclear deterrent , and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from north korea ( or china ) .
the japanese fear that the credibility of american extended deterrence will be weakened if the us decreases its nuclear forces to parity with china .
it is a mistake , however , to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons .
rather , it depends on a combination of capability and credibility .
during the cold war , the us was able to defend berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the nato alliance and the presence of american troops , whose lives would be on the line in the event of a soviet attack .
indeed , the best guarantee of american extended deterrence over japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 american troops ( which japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support ) .
credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense .
equally important are american actions that show the high priority that the us gives to the alliance , and its guarantees not to engage in what japan fears will be “ japan-@@ passing ” in its relations with asia .
that is why it was so important that us secretary of state hillary clinton ’ s first trip was to asia , and her first stop in japan .
it is also why it is mistaken to speak of a formal g-2 with china , rather than multilateral cooperation .
i responded then ( and today ) that there is little prospect of such a reversal , for two reasons .
moreover , china ’ s internal evolution remains uncertain .
while chinese are more free today than at any time in their history , china ’ s political evolution has lagged behind its economic progress .
unlike india , china has not solved the problem of political participation .
there is always a residual danger that china will embrace nationalism to ward off domestic problems .
at the same time , it is in the interest of the us , japan , and china that china ’ s rise be peaceful and harmonious ( in the words of chinese leaders ) .
treat china as an enemy , and you guarantee enmity .
that is why the strategy of integration , plus a hedge against uncertainty , makes sense for both the us and japan .
indeed , there are strong grounds for the us , japan , and china to engage in areas of trilateral and other regional cooperation .
third , the us-japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests , such as pandemics , terrorism , and human outflows from failed states .
chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming , with china having surpassed the us as the leading producer of carbon-dioxide emissions ( though not in per capita terms ) .
fortunately , this is an area that plays to japan ’ s strengths .
although some japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance ’ s security components , owing to the limits that japan has accepted on the use of force , in these new areas , japan is a stronger partner .
japan ’ s overseas development assistance in places ranging from africa to afghanistan , its participation in global health projects , its support of the united nations , its naval participation in anti-piracy operations , and its research and development on energy efficiency place it at the forefront in dealing with the new transnational challenges .
given today ’ s agenda , there is enormous potential for an equal partnership , working with others , in the provision of global public goods that will benefit the us , japan , and the rest of the world .
that is why i remain optimistic about the future of the us-japan alliance .

will the us “ lose ” latin america ?
on november 4-5 , the fourth summit of the americas took place in mar del plata , argentina .
the heads of state of the hemisphere ’ s democratic countries met to discuss economic , political , and social issues – and to lose another opportunity to create a new and healthier relationship between the united states and its latin american neighbors .
indeed , the summit amounted to nothing more than an outsized photo opportunity .
no important issues were resolved , and no progress was made on the many topics that increasingly divide the countries of latin america and the us .
in particular , no progress was made on the creation of a free-trade area for the region .
this is all the more disappointing , given that the region ’ s leaders declared more than a decade ago , during the first summit of the americas , held in miami in december 1994 , that free-trade negotiations would be “ concluded no later than 2005 . ”
at the center of the failure to make headway on the creation of the free trade area of the americas ( ftaa ) is america ’ s unwillingness , and that of the bush administration , to open up its agricultural sector to competition from countries such as argentina , brazil , and uruguay .
true , the us is not the worst offender in the world when it comes to farm protectionism ; the european union ’ s trade distortions are significantly more pervasive .
but it is also true that if the us wants to improve relations with its neighbors to the south , america should make significant bilateral trade concessions to the latin american countries .
in the absence of us leadership in matters of international trade , the majority of latin american countries will not open their economies further to foreign competition , and some may even return to increased protectionism .
unfortunately , the lack of progress on trade-related issues is not the only burden on relations between the us and latin america . there are also serious diplomatic and political problems .
very few latin american countries support the iraq war ; indeed , only a handful of small countries in the region contributed troops to the so-called “ coalition of the willing , ” and today only el salvador still has its troops in iraq .
more broadly , most latin american governments are increasingly critical of the bush administration ’ s foreign policy , and they are unlikely to support major initiatives in international forums , including in the united nations .
moreover , a growing number of latin american countries are veering left , and hugo chávez , the belligerent and anti-american venezuelan president , is becoming increasingly popular in every latin american country .
voters across latin america are becoming skeptical of market-oriented policies and globalization , making it more likely that in coming years , and under new leadership , economic policies in the region will be less friendly to foreign investment in general , and to us economic interests in particular .
it is not too late for the us to regain its political and diplomatic influence in latin america .
but improving relations with its neighbors to the south will require making commitments at several levels .
second , immigration reform in the us should be enacted in a way that protects the rights of latino migrants . and , third , the us should support the demands of latin american countries for a greater say in international institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund .
these initiatives will give the signal to latin american leaders that , despite appearances to the contrary – including the latest summit of the americas – the region has not been completely neglected by president bush and the us .

can trump ’ s sanctions break iran ?
london – “ the iran sanctions have officially been cast , ” tweeted us president donald trump three months after he signed an executive order in may announcing his administration ’ s withdrawal from the 2015 iran nuclear deal .
he went on to boast the return of “ the most biting sanctions ever imposed , ” as if sounding the death knell of the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) , as the deal is officially known .
the announcement took few observers by surprise .
but the irony was not lost on wendy sherman , the jcpoa ’ s senior us negotiator , who quipped recently that she had always expected “ the greatest challenge to the deal ’ s success would be violations by iran , not the political machinations of the president of the united states . ”
indeed , iran and the us seem to have reversed roles : iran ’ s isolation before the deal now contrasts with america ’ s determination to swim against the global tide .
disappointment , if not disbelief , prevailed among the jcpoa ’ s other parties – the european union countries , russia , and china – whose leaders were quick to reaffirm their strong commitment to the agreement .
by contrast , us officials have reiterated the trump administration ’ s determination permanently to rein in iran ’ s “ nuclear ambitions , ” limit its ballistic missiles program , and scale down its regional influence .
by the sanctions ’ final stage , which kicks in on november 4 ( coinciding , as it happens , with the 39th anniversary of the abduction of diplomats and staff at the us embassy in tehran in 1979 ) , the us goal is to reduce iran ’ s oil exports “ down to zero . ”
given the long and fraught history of economic sanctions against iran , the question looming now is whether this time they are more likely to be effective in changing the regime or its behavior .
the last time iran ’ s oil exports were reduced to negligible levels through an extensive economic boycott was in the mid-twentieth century , when iran ’ s popularly elected prime minister , mohammad mossadegh , nationalized the oil industry .
a british@@ -led blockade of iran ’ s oil brought the industry to a virtual standstill , destabilized the economy , and paved the way for the infamous us and uk-@@ instigated coup which restored the shah to power in 1953 .
such has been the hangover from those tumultuous years that it took a half-century for us secretary of state madeleine albright to acknowledge in 2000 that the coup that ousted mossadegh was a clear “ setback for iran ’ s political development ” and a key reason “ why many iranians continue to resent this intervention by america . ”
such remorse , if it can be considered that , did not , however , close the door on more sanctions against iran .
sanctions imposed by the us and the eu from 2010 to 2015 had mixed results . these comprehensive measures – described by then-us vice president joe biden as “ the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions , ” shrank oil exports by two-thirds , to below one million barrels a day .
the resulting stagflation heaped misery on ordinary iranians , with gdp contracting almost 6 % in 2012 and inflation averaging 35 % the following year .
widespread private-sector failures and growing unemployment followed .
contrary to the sanctions ’ principal objectives , however , the economic and political hold of the public sector and parastatal organizations strengthened .
meanwhile , iran insisted on its sovereign right to pursue a peaceful nuclear program .
the scope for compromise seemed absent until the reformist administration of president hassan rouhani took over in 2013 .
so what is different this time ?
though promising to be even more biting , the us sanctions regime is not backed by un security council resolutions and hence lacks international legitimacy .
this means iran ’ s isolation will be far less complete , with key trading partners such as china and turkey already announcing that they will abide by “ legal ” sanctions only .
but the sanctions ’ de facto , not de jure , status will determine their effectiveness .
this is especially true of european firms , which will ultimately decide the outcome of the battle for secondary sanctions in cogniz@@ ance of their shareholders ’ interests , rather than the political machinations of their governments .
this explains the significant stream of exits from iran ’ s markets already announced by large firms .
in an interconnected world where us economic influence extends far and wide , it is hard even for european firms – auto manufacturers , airlines , energy companies , banks , and the like – to risk the ire of the us treasury .
this means that the ultimate success of sanctions is likely to depend on what others make of them as much as on what iran does .
but domestic conditions in iran also play a key role , and it is here that the us seems to be basing its confidence that sanctions will “ succeed . ”
for months , iranian cities have been rocked by widespread protests , ostensibly against worsening economic conditions .
these outbursts have weakened iran ’ s reformers by undermining their monopoly on hope .
hardliners , it seems , have been offered a new lease on life and can now claim their dismissal of the jcpoa was justified from the start .
the economic impact has already been felt , with the iranian currency going into freefall after speculation about a us withdrawal from the deal began .
the specter of inflation is back .
ultimately , for sanctions to succeed from the us perspective , they must bring about either regime change or behavioral change .
historically , sanctions have a less-than-@@ convincing track record ( think cuba , myanmar , and zimbabwe ) on achieving the former , and whether they can pave the way for the latter , in the form of a negotiated settlement , remains to be seen .
but one thing is clear : applied to iran , the “ trump doctrine ” of pushing one ’ s foes to the brink , in the hope that they will blink first , has entered uncharted terrain .

will we save the international financial system ?
the world bank and imf have completed their annual meetings , which were greeted by street demonstrations and a paucity of innovative ideas .
here george soros suggests a bold new tack to restructure the world &apos;s financial system .
the international financial system is broken down in the sense that it fails to provide adequate capital to countries that need it most and qualify for it .
global financial markets suck most of the world &apos;s savings to the center , but they fail to pump money back out to the periphery .
indeed , since 1997 , there has been a reverse flow of capital from countries on the poor periphery of the world economy to those in the wealthy center .
the facts speak for themselves .
america runs a chronic current account deficit approaching an astonishing 5 % of gdp ; $ 242 billion in the first half of this year .
at the same time , brazil - which has followed sound economic policies and has healthy budget and trade surpluses - cannot refinance its debt at acceptable rates .
the prevailing belief that market discipline corrects such imbalances is false , for two reasons .
first , financial markets are inherently unstable .
instability arises because financial markets try to discount a future that depends on their own behavior .
it is now recognized that this can lead to what economists call &quot; multiple equilibria , &quot; but we continue to deny the clear implication that financial markets cannot be left to their own devices .
in practice , of course , international financial markets never have been left to their own devices .
rich countries , led by the us , are in charge .
their primary task is protecting their own interests .
when these countries get into trouble , their authorities intervene forcefully .
countries that cannot borrow in international markets in their own currency lack that power .
they must turn to the imf , and the imf is more concerned with international financial stability than with enabling developing countries to pursue the countercyclical policies needed to avoid recession .
until recently , imf rescue programs were designed to enable debtor countries to meet their obligations .
taxpayers in debtor countries , such as mexico , picked up the tab .
this may have been unfair , but at least it kept money flowing to the periphery .
that crisis was attributed not to instability in the financial markets and the lop@@ sidedness of the system , but to the &quot; moral hazard &quot; introduced by imf bail-outs .
this lead to a u-turn : from bail-outs to &quot; bail-ins , &quot; and to private sector burden sharing .
moral hazard has been curtailed but the risks of investing in emerging markets increased .
those risks are now reflected in market prices , which is the source of today &apos;s problem .
what can prevent the situation from deteriorating further and perhaps culminating in a systemic crisis ?
in the broadest terms , we must create a more level playing field .
there is nothing wrong with imposing market discipline on countries that follow unsound policies , but the risk-@@ reward ratio for lending and investing has shifted too far against the periphery .
countries that qualify ought to have access to a lender of last resort and be empowered to pursue countercyclical policies .
brazil , for example , confronts an unambiguous case of market failure .
although the maximum sustainable real interest rate is about 10 % , brazil &apos;s dollar-denominated debt yields 24.5 % .
a one-year real note pays 27 % .
at these rates , brazil is heading for bankruptcy .
if no lender of last resort ensures that credit is available at or below 10 % , brazil cannot be expected to meet its obligations - dealing a terrible blow both to brazil and the international financial system .
where there is a political will , there is a way .
for instance , the central banks of the us , europe , japan , and britain could accept brazilian paper at their discount windows .
the imf could guarantee the central banks against market risk at current prices .
this would provide a tremendous boost to the market and drastically reduce interest rates .
naturally , all guarantees would be conditional on brazil abiding by the imf agreement .
if successful , the imf guarantee would never be invoked .
what i propose is novel : it would leverage the imf &apos;s $ 30 billion loan to brazil tenfold ( and set a useful precedent ) .
unfortunately , such a scheme exceeds the imagination and political will of the imf &apos;s shareholders .
but let &apos;s be clear : failure to address the problem could have disastrous consequences .
after all , how would a brazilian default affect mexico ?
addressing the broader , system-wide problem , we must find ways to stimulate domestic-led growth in the periphery countries .
countries that follow sound macroeconomic policies do not derive sufficient economic benefits from doing so .
this generates political discontent that could have adverse consequences beyond the economic sphere .
at present , the us serves as the motor of the global economy .
but a chronic current account deficit is unsound , unfair , and unsustainable in the long run .
more urgently , the us motor is sputtering .
it would be benefit all parties to start another motor .
to this end , i proposed an annual issue of special drawing rights ( sdr ) that rich countries would donate for international assistance .
this is a proposal whose time has come because the world economy is hovering on the brink of deflation .
until recently , globalization unfolded against the background of a global boom ; now we are experiencing a global bear market .
i am afraid globalization may not survive unless we find new ways to stimulate the global economy .
the sdr donation scheme would activate resources that are currently idle , benefiting donors and recipients .
it would also reduce the increasing inequality between rich and poor countries .

ukraine ’ s revolt of the oligarchs
kyiv – ukraine ’ s parliamentary election on october 28 will be neither free nor fair .
after eight unproductive years since the 2004 orange revolution , the democratic opposition is depressed and demoralized .
even so , the elections may check president viktor yanukovych ’ s power .
yanukovych came to power in february 2010 , in elections that were rated free and fair ( and at a time when freedom house still ranked ukraine as democratic ) .
but he quickly consolidated power and turned ukraine into a mildly authoritarian state .
a dozen prominent opposition politicians have been sentenced to prison , including former prime minister yulia tymoshenko and the former interior minister , yuri lutsenko .
tymoshenko , who was and remains the leader of the liberal and pro-western opposition , was sentenced to seven years in prison for a gas deal with russia in which she was not even accused of having benefited personally .
without her , the democratic opposition has no strong leader .
but yanukovych has not stopped there .
he exerts heavy pressure on private television channels , and has blocked licenses and cable access for the independent television channel tvi , which has exposed the most serious corruption cases of his administration .
moreover , he uses the civil service and law-enforcement authorities extensively to repress the opposition and promote his protégés .
and yet the upcoming election matters .
ukraine has a vibrant civil society and excellent free internet media .
but the opposition , which comprises half the country , is badly demoralized after five years of stalemate among the orange revolution ’ s leaders , for which the largest share of blame falls on former president viktor yushchenko , who by almost all accounts has betrayed the democratic breakthrough that he represented .
he now leads a party that supports yanukovych , who has even allowed yushchenko to remain in the presidential residence since leaving office .
ukrainian voters are fickle .
they voted against the incumbent powers in the presidential elections of 1994 , 2004 , and 2010 . they may do so again .
the predatory nature of yanukovych ’ s rule is not exactly well hidden ; his family members and loyalists control the entire security apparatus and the main economic agencies .
he is rightly scared by the democratic opposition , which he is emasculating by all reasonably soft means .
anticipating that his party might lose the upcoming election if ukraine ’ s proportional voting system were maintained , yanukovych has reverted to the electoral system of 2002 , with only half of the 450 seats to be distributed proportionally .
the remaining 225 seats will be filled in winner-take-all single-member constituencies – a change that gives regional tycoons a great opportunity to buy seats .
but yanukovych failed to anticipate that tycoons would dare to be disloyal to him .
initially , his government contained nine groups of big businessmen , but that number has fallen gradually , and even top businessmen have been marginalized by his core loyalists , who are widely rumored to be enriching themselves at the expense of both the state and private business .
unlike russian president vladimir putin , yanukovych seems to have steamrolled too many too fast , overestimating his power and narrowing his base .
indeed , he appears to have turned all of ukraine ’ s top oligarchs into his enemies .
each summer , the prominent ukrainian businessman victor pinchuk organizes a major international conference , the yalta european strategy , attended by the ukrainian elite and prominent foreigners .
this september , the lesson of the conference was that yanukovych has isolated himself not only from the west and russia , but also from his main backers at home .
the ukrainian tycoons are no fools .
they view the upcoming election as their last chance to stand up against yanukovych .
the many parliamentarians to be elected in single-member constituencies are more likely to obey them than yanukovych .
under the electoral system in place in 2002 , the ruling party quickly disintegrated into nine oligarchic party factions .
the tycoons might not oust yanukovych , but they will check his power .
their most vocal public representatives are first deputy prime minister valeri@@ y khoroshkov@@ skiy and the economy minister , petro poroshenko , who was a major force behind the orange revolution .
the businessmen ’ s main objection to yanukovych is that he prefers to keep tymoshenko in prison rather than obtain an association agreement with the european union .
the already-@@ concluded free-trade agreement with the eu would offer ukraine badly needed market access and increased exports , but the eu will not ratify it unless tymoshenko is released and repression of the opposition and media ceases .
similarly , the tycoons advocate restored cooperation with the international monetary fund , because they want access to credit at reasonable interest rates .
but yanukovych refuses to liberalize gas prices , a key imf demand .
concern that the west ’ s pro-reform stance will push ukraine into russia ’ s embrace is largely unfounded .
yanukovych ’ s personal relations with putin are so poor that putin all but refuses to talk to him – other than to make preposterous demands .
the west thus has an important role to play in the election , and is providing two thousand election monitors to help to ensure a free and fair vote .
indeed , the united states and the eu , in particular , have a large stake in the outcome .
ukraine is a friendly country – one that always joins western “ coalitions of the willing . ”
but it is a lapsed democratic country .
they must help to change that .

berlin – when considering climate change , most people think wind turbines and solar panels are a big part of the solution .
but , over the next 25 years , the contribution of solar and wind power to resolving the problem will be trivial – and the cost will be enormous .
the international energy agency estimates that about 0.4 % of global energy now comes from solar and wind .
even in 2040 , with all governments implementing all of their green promises , solar and wind will make up just 2.2 % of global energy .
this is partly because wind and solar help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions only from electricity generation , which account for 42 % of the total , but not from the energy used in industry , transport , buildings , and agriculture .
but the main reason why wind and solar power cannot be a major solution to climate change stems from an almost insurmountable obstacle : we need power when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing .
this has major implications for claims about costs .
for example , wind power , we are repeatedly told , is just about to be cheaper than fossil fuels – or even , as a recent global news story claimed , that it is now cheaper than fossil fuels in germany and the united kingdom .
this is mostly a mirage – large-scale wind power will not work anytime soon without subsidies .
as warren buffet says : “ &#91; w &#93; e get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms .
that ’ s the only reason to build them .
they don ’ t make sense without the tax credit . ” the iea estimates that the annual bill for global wind subsidies will increase over the next 25 years , not decrease or fall to zero .
one reason is that cheaper wind in germany and the uk is true only for new construction .
most existing coal and gas suppliers cost about half or less than wind and could run for decades ; instead , we half-@@ close them to accommodate wind .
whereas the new , cheap german wind-energy producers cost $ 80 per mwh ( $ 0.0@@ 8 per kwh ) , the average german spot price in 2014 was just $ 33 per mwh .
more important , wind is cheaper only when the wind blows .
when the wind is not blowing , wind-generated electricity is the most expensive electricity of all , because it cannot be bought at any price .
the first wind turbine brings a slightly above-average price per kwh .
but with 30 % market share , since all wind producers sell electricity at the same time ( when the wind blows ) , the electricity is worth only 70 % of the average electricity price .
solar prices drop even faster at similar market shares .
so wind and solar generators have to be much cheaper than the average price to be competitive .
moreover , wind and solar make fossil-fuel-@@ generated electricity more expensive .
some people may think that is a good thing ; but , if our societies are to continue functioning in cloudy , windless weather , that means relying on some fossil fuels .
the iea estimates that 56 % of electricity will come from fossil fuels in 2040 , with nuclear and hydro accounting for another 28 % .
significant wind and solar usage reduces the number of hours gas and coal generation operates ; with large fixed costs , this makes every kwh more expensive .
in a real electricity market , this would result in much higher electricity costs on windless evenings .
but this is politically problematic , which is why markets are often constructed to spike much less .
in spain , gas plants were used 66 % of the time in 2004 , but only 19 % of the time now , largely because of more wind use .
because the plants must be kept running 57 % of the time to avoid losses , many are likely to close .
keeping the lights on means either accepting much higher prices or emulating what many european governments are beginning to do – namely , subsidize fossil-fuel plants .
for example , in 2018 alone , the uk will pay nearly £ 1 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) , mostly to fossil-fuel-based generators , to keep backup capacity available for peak power usage .
building more wind and solar generating capacity with subsidies means societies end up paying three times for power – once for the power , once for subsidies to inefficient renewables , and once more to subsidize our now-@@ inefficient fossil fuels .
many will say , “ but at least we cut co2 . ”
that is true , although the reduction is perhaps only half of what is often touted , because the back-up power needed to smooth intermittent wind and solar is often more co ₂ -@@ heavy .
moreover , we pay dearly for these cuts .
in 2013 , the world produced 635 twh of wind electricity and paid at least $ 28 billion in subsidies , or $ 76 per avoided ton of co ₂ , and likely twice or more than that .
when the estimated damage costs of co2 are about $ 5 per ton , and a ton of co2 can be cut in the european union for about $ 10 , we are paying a dollar to do less than 7-13 cents of good for the climate .
and its positive impact on the climate is negligible .
consider two worlds : in the first , all governments implement all their green promises , as indicated by the iea , and increase solar and wind energy more than seven-fold by 2040 ; in the second , not one new solar panel or wind turbine is purchased over the next 25 years .
the difference in subsidy spending between the two worlds is more than $ 2.5 trillion .
one day , when the wind price has fallen much further and solar is almost as cheap as wind , significant investments in wind and solar could be a great idea .
but even after decades of capital reallocation , these sources might account for a bit less than a quarter of our electricity .
in short , a world powered by solar and wind – one that has resolved the climate challenge – is very unlikely anytime soon .

winners and losers in the post-9 / 11 era
september 11 , 2001 , is one of those dates that mark a transformation in world politics .
just as the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , signified the cold war ’ s end , al-qaeda ’ s attack on the united states opened a new epoch .
a non-governmental group killed more americans that day than the government of japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date , december 7 , 1941 .
while the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade , 9 / 11 was the turning point .
five years into this new era , how should we characterize it ?
some believe that 9 / 11 ushered in a “ clash of civilizations ” between islam vs. the west .
indeed , that is probably what osama bin laden had in mind .
terrorism is a form of theater .
extremists kill innocent people in order to dramatize their message in a way that shocks and horri@@ fies their intended audience .
they also rely on what clark mccauley and others have called “ jujitsu politics , ” in which a smaller fighter uses the strength of the larger opponent to defeat him .
in that sense , bin laden hoped that the us would be lured into a bloody war in afghanistan , similar to the soviet intervention two decades earlier , which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists .
but the americans used a modest amount of force to remove the taliban government , avoided disproportionate civilian casualties , and were able to create an indigenous political framework .
while far from perfect , the first round in the fight went to the us .
al-qaeda lost the sanctuaries from which it planned its attacks ; many of its leaders were killed or captured ; and its central communications were severely disrupted .
then the bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading iraq without broad international support .
iraq provided the symbols , civilian casualties , and recruiting ground that the jihadi extremists had sought in afghanistan .
iraq was george bush ’ s gift to osama bin laden .
al-qaeda lost its central organizational capacity , but it became a symbol and focal point around which like-minded imitators could rally .
with the help of the internet , its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world .
whether al-qaeda had a direct role in the madrid and london bombings , or the recent plot to blow up airliners over the atlantic , is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful “ brand . ”
the second round went to the extremists .
the outcome of future rounds in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the trap of “ jujitsu politics . ”
that will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than relying so heavily on hard military power , as the bush administration has done .
for the struggle is not a clash of islam vs. the west , but a civil war within islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non-violent believers .
jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins .
military force , intelligence , and international police cooperation needs to be used against hardcore terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al-qaeda , but soft power is essential to attracting the mainstream and drying up support for the extremists .
us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and deterring is larger than the number that the terrorists are recruiting .
by this standard , we are doing badly .
in november 2003 , the official number of terrorist insurgents in iraq was given as 5,000 .
this year , it was reported to be 20,000 .
as bri@@ g. general robert caslen , the pentagon ’ s deputy director for the war on terrorism , put it , “ we are not killing them faster than they are being created . ”
we are also failing in the application of soft power .
according to caslen , “ we in the pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or train . ”
the manner in which we use military power also affects rumsfeld ’ s ratio .
in the aftermath of 9 / 11 , there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for america ’ s military response against the taliban .
the us invasion of iraq , a country that was not connected to the 9 / 11 attacks , squandered that good will , and the attractiveness of the us in muslim countries like indonesia plummeted from 75 % approval in 2000 to half that level today .
indeed , occupying a divided nation is messy , and it is bound to produce episodes like abu ghraib and haditha , which undercut america ’ s attractiveness not just in iraq , but around the world .
when the soviet union invaded hungary and czechoslovakia during the cold war , it undercut the soft power that it had enjoyed in europe in the aftermath of world war ii .
when israel launched a lengthy bombing campaign in lebanon last month , it created so many civilian casualties that the early criticisms of hezbollah by egypt , jordan , and saudi arabia became untenable in arab politics .
when terrorist excesses killed innocent muslim civilians such as egyptian islamic jihad did in 1993 or abu musab al-zarqawi did in amman in 2005 , they undercut their own soft power and lost support .
the most important lesson five years after 9 / 11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations .
muslims , including islamists , have a diversity of views , so we need to be wary of strategies that help our enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner .
we have a just cause and many potential allies , but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal .

the middle east ’ s lost decade
berlin – the united states has waged three wars since al qaeda ’ s terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 : against al qaeda , in afghanistan , and in iraq .
the first two were forced upon the us , but the third was the result of a willful , deliberate decision by former president george w. bush , taken on ideological grounds and , most likely , for personal reasons as well .
had bush , former vice president dick cheney , former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , and their neocon allies been forthright about their intentions – to bring down saddam hussein by means of war , thereby creating a new , pro-western middle east – they never would have received the support of congress and the american public . their vision was both naive and reckless .
so a threat – iraqi weapons of mass destruction – had to be created . as we now know , the threat was based on lies ( aluminum tubes for a nuclear-weapons program , for example , meetings between the 9 / 11 plot leader , mohamed atta , and iraqi officials in prague , and even glaring for@@ geries like supposed iraqi orders for yellowcake uranium from niger ) .
such were the justifications for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 us soldiers and more than 100,000 iraqis .
add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes , as well as the destruction of one of the world ’ s oldest christian communities .
for this , the us alone spent up to $ 3 trillion .
bush ’ s war against saddam did radically change the middle east , though not as he envisaged . for starters , if the us had set out to destabilize iraq , its efforts could hardly have been more successful : ten years later , the country ’ s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt .
with saddam gone , iraq ’ s shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war , leaving iraq ’ s defeated sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy .
the kurds in the north cleverly and adeptly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to seize de facto independence , though the key question of control over the northern city of kirkuk remains a ticking time bomb .
taking stock of “ operation iraqi freedom ” a decade later , the financial times concluded that the us won the war , iran won the peace , and turkey won the contracts .
i can only agree .
in political terms , iran is the big winner of bush ’ s war .
its number-one enemy , saddam , was dispatched by its number-two enemy , the united states , which presented iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 1746 .
bush ’ s war , with its poor strategic vision and worse planning , increased iran ’ s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own .
the war enabled iran to assert itself as the dominant power in the gulf and the wider region , and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambitions .
the losers in the region are also clear : saudi arabia and the other gulf states , which feel existentially threatened , and have come to regard their own shia minorities as an iranian fifth column .
they have a point : with the shia in power in iraq , iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims .
this is what is fueling bahrain ’ s domestic turmoil , beyond the shia majority ’ s local grievances .
leaving aside the lies , fictions , and questions of morality and personal responsibility , the critical mistake of america ’ s war against iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to enforce a pax americana in the middle east .
america was powerful enough to destabilize the existing regional order , but not powerful enough to establish a new one .
the us neocons , with their wishful thinking , grossly underestimated the scale of the task at hand – unlike the revolutionaries in iran , who quickly moved in to reap what the us had sowed .
the iraq war also marked the beginning of america ’ s subsequent relative decline .
bush squandered a large part of america ’ s military strength in mesopotamia for an ideological fiction – strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later .
and there is no alternative to be seen without america .
while there is no causal link between the iraq war and the arab revolutions that began in december 2010 , their implications have combined in a malign manner .
since the war , the bitter enmities between al qaeda and other salafist and sunni arab nationalist groups have given way to cooperation or even mergers .
this , too , is a result brought about by the american neocon masterminds .
and the regional destabilization triggered by the arab revolutions is increasingly converging on iraq , mainly via syria and iran .
indeed , the gravest current danger to the region is a process of national disintegration emanating from the syrian civil war , which is threatening to spread not only to iraq , but also to lebanon and jordan .
what makes syria ’ s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces .

winning at corporate governance
cambridge : despite nasdaq crashes and the threat of us recession , the new economy is here to stay .
indeed , it remains the key to improved performance in europe and japan in the years ahead .
but where , exactly , does the heart of the new economy lie ?
is it in more competitive labor markets or in better tax systems or in deregulation ?
corporate governance , too , is a motor of the new economy that should not be underrated .
if managers create productive , flexible structures focused on wealth creation , companies find it easy to adjust and explore new sources of productivity and cost control .
if decentralization and risk taking are part of a company ’ s mission , innovation in products and processes is certain to take place .
if , on the contrary , bosses behave like cautious executors of a wealthy estate , their companies will soon look like museums .
a country ’ s economic performance , indeed , is a mirror image of its resident companies .
countries with great companies show great performance .
where then are the great companies of the world to be found ?
no surprise that more than half of the most respected companies are american .
although europe is roughly the same economic size as the us , it has far fewer winning corporate teams .
japan may be much smaller than america or europe , but it underperforms its share of g7 income or wealth .
the picture could not be clearer : the us economy performs stunningly , as does its corporate sector ; europe is far behind ; and japan does not really register .
pe@@ ering into the future of this premier league of companies five years from now , the ft sees a number of shifts as likely , with europe catching up , japan losing even more ground , and america giving up some ground , too .
this glimpse into the future mirrors today ’ s perceptions of a maturing ( a code-@@ word for losing its edge ) american economy and a europe able to play catch-up because the new business culture is at last taking hold .
this survey also accurately reflects the reality that very few japanese firms are succeeding at the hard task of restructuring , of shifting to modern , world-class governance .
world-class sony stays ahead ; ntt ( its docomo subsidiary is the key here ) holds on , but old and tired honda and matsushita are likely to be relegated to second class status .
the dynamics of the next 5 years will also reflect a head-on competition between winning corporations .
boeing versus airbus may be the most interesting example .
in the current rankings , both are locked in a clinch close to the bottom of the ft list of top firms .
in 5 years , however , airbus will likely be up and boeing out of the champions league altogether .
why ?
airbus has looked ahead , invested , and is bringing on a new jumbo jet that will make boeing ’ s existing products look outdated and inefficient .
for boeing became complacent and forgot that the airline business is a cut-@@ throat world .
when thinking about economic potential , we tend to look at the quality of the labor force , a people ’ s willingness to work , and the level of education .
seen from this perspective , europe and japan should tro@@ unce the us because of their far superior basic education systems , and japanese discipline make europeans look lazy .
in fact , effort and education are not what matters most .
far more significant is the economic environment in which people work – a market economy versus some form of socialism – and the organization of businesses in which they participate .
the best model of corporate governance to produce strong and lasting economic performance remains to be found .
in the 1980s , respect for the long-run view of the japanese model ran high .
this is no longer so because of japan ’ s economic malaise .
then there was the flirtation with the german model of business-@@ banking integration , which brings capital markets in-house .
that lost its attraction when it became clear that cozy relations between bankers and bosses result in tolerance for poor rates of return on capital .
now the us model is in : decentralized , lean on middle management , tough on the ceo ; and with a “ don ’ t take no for an answer ” code .
but this won ’ t be the last answer , although for the time being it will drive corporate restructuring and the managerial mind .
all this begs the question as to whether it makes sense to change corporate cultures every 10 or 20 years .
the pragmatic answer is that it takes very different models to handle a stable and stationary world as opposed to a world in which deregulation and technology produce dramatic change daily .
the us model works in times of rapid , pervasive change .
this is what lies ahead for the foreseeable future .
hold on tight .

winning over globalization ’ s losers
on both sides of the atlantic , many view economic globalization as a threat to below-average earners .
according to a recent poll by the german marshall fund , majorities in france , germany , and the united states favor maintaining existing trade barriers , even if doing so hampers economic growth .
clearly , the large net gains from global economic integration are not enough to convince those who have lost their jobs and the many others who feel at risk .
the recently established european globalization adjustment fund ( egf ) is an eu-wide response to this challenge .
the egf can spend up to € 500 million annually in eu member states on workers affected by trade-@@ induced layoffs .
but sharing the benefits of globalization with the losers is traditionally regarded as a national responsibility .
for example , the inspiration for the egf , america ’ s trade adjustment assistance , introduced by the kennedy administration in 1962 , is a purely national scheme .
is eu involvement really justified ?
the economic case for a european globalization fund is that trade policy has been delegated to the european level , while union members retain control rights to block decisions .
consider the hypothetical example of full trade liberalization in textiles , which would have greatly asymmetric effects between , say , sweden , with hardly any textile industry , and portugal , with a substantial one .
sweden would be a clear beneficiary while portugal would be hit hard , owing to the large number of displaced textile workers .
the negative impact of such redundancies is serious .
oecd statistics show that 40 % to 50 % of displaced manufacturing workers in the eu15 remain without a job 24 months after becoming unemployed .
around 30 % work in a job that pays less than the previous one .
only around one-quarter are re-@@ employed with a wage at or above the previous level ( see chart ) .
manufacturing workers 24 months after layoff in the eu15
source : oecd
although sweden , for example , would be a net contributor to the egf , it might well be a net beneficiary of the arrangement as a whole .
in principle , a web of bilateral transfer arrangements could achieve such an unblocking of trade .
nevertheless , the egf ’ s rules need to be tightened , lest the scheme comes to be regarded as a political gimmick .
the current setup leaves too much room for discretion , as neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for aid are clearly spelled out .
this will expose the egf to wasteful political posturing and lobbying by countries and sectors .
the egf ’ s rules should be amended to ensure that governments and trade-@@ displaced workers receive transparent , visible , and reliable assistance , as well as to spread best practice in active labor market policy .
displaced workers often face unemployment , a lower-paying job , or a new job far from home . of these , the unemployed typically receive most public support .
to address this distortion head on , and to provide clarity concerning the allocation of funds , the egf should focus its limited funds on two simple active labor market programs : wage insurance and mobility allowance .
wage insurance could offer workers whose pay was cut after displacement compensation for up to two years amounting to half the difference between the old and the new wage .
the mobility allowance could offer those moving for a new job a lump-sum payment of two months ’ gross pay in the previous job , or four months ’ pay for cross-border moves .
the very simplicity of this scheme will likely ensure high visibility and reasonable take-up rates .
the downside of such a focused approach is also clear : the margin of choice for eu members about how egf funds are to be spent in their country would be minimal .
in view of the likely advantages , this might be acceptable if member states could be assured that , if the schemes work , it will be expanded .
this can be done as part of a reform of the european social fund , which has an annual budget of around € 10 billion – twenty times the current funding of the egf .
if the egf does not prove effective , the money can simply be given back to the eu budget or to member states .
but if the egf does work , the benefits would far outweigh the costs .

winning the confidence game
new haven – on april 2 , the g-20 will hold a summit in london to discuss what we may hope will be an internationally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis .
but can such a plan really work ?
people everywhere , consumers and investors alike , are canceling spending plans , because the world economy seems very risky right now .
the same thing happened during the great depression of the 1930 ’ s .
a contemporary observer , winthrop case , explained it all in 1938 : economic revival depended “ on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time .
for the individual , this implies confidence in the job , and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders . ” unfortunately , confidence did not return until world war ii ended the depression .
if the leaders meeting in london are to succeed where governments failed in the 1930 ’ s , they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions .
they must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to normal .
people will not spend normally unless they have both a job and normal access to credit .
during the great depression , such targets were not used on a large enough scale , merely fueling public despair that stimulus policies would ever work .
the g-20 summit should also be an occasion for affirming some basic principles .
people need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures , which may eventually end in failure .
after all , the great depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war-related expenditures .
why should world war ii have produced any confidence in the future ?
to be sure , world war ii reduced the unemployment rate in the united states dramatically , from 15 % in 1940 to 1 % in 1944 , and had a similar effect in other countries .
but this was not because of a revival in business confidence . it was because of a nasty war , plain and simple , with people drafted into fighting , or into industries supplying the war effort .
the real recovery of confidence did not occur until after world war ii , when the world did not sink back into depression .
the us council of economic advisors warned of this possibility in 1949 , and it was not alone .
there appears to be more than one reason why , on the contrary , confidence came roaring back .
first , there was a general perception of “ pent-up demand . ”
after years of privation ( and in many countries the physical destruction of war ) , people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild , own a home , a car , and other consumer goods .
the widespread impression that there was such pent-up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression .
the perception of pent-up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package , and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long-lasting .
indeed , the same long-term confidence triggered the post-war “ baby boom . ”
according to some contemporary observers , however , “ pent-up demand ” was only part of the story .
during the brief but deep recession of 1949 , the financial commentator silvia porter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash : “ we saw nothing wrong – in fact , we saw everything right – with the wild speculative boom and credit inflation that … culminated in the now almost unbelievable gambling orgy of 1929 . ”
but now , porter wrote , after the depression and war , “ we began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens , acting through a central government , could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units .
we developed , in short , a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government . ” she concluded that the positive effect of “ pent-up demand ” and government measures can “ make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy . ”
the marshall plan , which operated from 1947 to 1951 , became a symbol of this new attitude .
the us gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war-ravaged countries in europe .
the plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment , a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help .
europe would not be allowed to languish , and the stimulus came from abroad .
after the war , keynesian economic theory , which was generally not accepted or understood during the great depression , became the basis of a new social compact .
it was a theory that was perfectly suited to a generation that had just endured exceptional sacrifices , for it reaffirmed a belief in our responsibility for each other .
the effect of economic stimulus is redoubled by this kind of inspirational belief .
that is why all of the commitments made and intentions expressed at the upcoming g-20 summit matter .
the countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people .
seemingly peripheral issues , like aid to the developing world and the poor , who suffer the most from a crisis like this one , will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence , just as the marshall plan was part of that story after world war ii .

winning the european confidence game
chicago – if any solution to the european crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign-bond markets , it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike .
this means paying attention not just to the plan ’ s technical details , but also to appearances .
there is growing consensus about any solution ’ s key elements .
first , italy and spain will have to come up with credible medium-term plans that will not just restore their fiscal health , but also improve their ability to grow their way out of trouble .
while any plan will involve pain for citizens , the markets must deem the pain politically tolerable , at least relative to the alternatives .
it is important that these plans be seen as domestically devised ( though voters will have no illusions about the external and market pressures that have forced their governments to act ) .
at the same time , an external agency such as the international monetary fund could render the plan more credible by evaluating it for consistency with the country ’ s goals and monitoring its implementation .
second , some vehicle – the imf or the european financial stability facility , with either entity funded directly by countries or the european central bank – has to stand ready to fund borrowing by italy , spain , and any other potentially distressed countries over the next year or two .
but there is an important caveat , which has largely been ignored in public discussions : if this funding is senior to private debt ( as imf funding typically is ) , it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets .
after all , the more a country borrows in the short term from official sources , the further back in line it pushes private creditors .
that makes private lenders susceptible to larger haircuts if the country eventually defaults – and thus more hesitant to lend in the first place .
in other words , private markets need to be convinced both that there is a low probability of default ( hence the importance of credible plans ) , and that there is some additional loss-bearing capacity in the new funding , so that , if there is a default , outstanding or rol@@ led-@@ over private debt does not have to bear the full brunt .
this may seem unfair .
why should the taxpayer accept a loss when they are bailing out the private sector by providing new funding ?
in an ideal world , distressed countries would default as soon as private markets stopped funding them , and they would impose the losses on private bondholders .
in the real world , however , if italy and spain are viewed as being solvent , or too big to fail , official funding should be structured so that it gives these countries their best chance to regain market confidence .
this does not mean that official funding should be junior to private debt in any restructuring , for that would require substantially more loss-bearing capacity from the official sector – capacity that is probably not available .
indeed , if official funding were junior , it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors – and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent .
the simplest solution is to treat official funding no differently from private debt – best achieved if official lenders buy sovereign bonds as they are issued ( possibly at a predetermined yield ) and agree to be treated on par with private creditors in a restructuring .
as the country regains market confidence , the official funding can be reduced , and eventually the bonds can be sold back to the markets .
the bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by loss-bearing capacity .
if the funding is channeled through the imf , and is to be treated on par with private debt , the fund will need a guarantee from the efsf or strong eurozone countries that it will be inde@@ m@@ ni@@ fied in any restructuring .
of course , the imf ’ s member states might be willing to accept some burden sharing if a sufficient buffer provided by the eurozone were eroded , but that cannot be taken for granted .
once the first two elements of the plan are in place , there should be little need for the third – bond purchases by the ecb in the secondary market in order to narrow interest-rate spreads and provide further confidence .
indeed , if the ecb intends to claim preferred-creditor status for any bonds that it buys , it is probably best that it buy very few .
of course , the ecb will have to continue to provide support to banks until confidence about their holdings returns .
but there is one more element that is needed to assure markets that the solution is politically viable .
citizens across europe , whether in rescued countries or rescuing countries , will be paying for years to clean up a mess for which they were not responsible .
not all banks voluntarily loaded up on distressed government bonds – some were pressured by supervisors , others by governments – but many have made unwise bets .
if they are seen as profiting unduly from the rescue , even as they return to their bad old ways of paying for non-performance , they will undermine political support for the rescue – and perhaps even for capitalism .
cries that this is not capitalism should be met with a firm retort : “ nor are bailouts ! ”

winning the peace
afghanistan ’ s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency , warlords , the heroin trade , and a disappointed populace .
across an arc extending from afghanistan to east africa , violence now also surges in iraq , lebanon , somalia , and beyond , to sudan ’ s darfur region .
everywhere , politicians , generals , and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers , but everywhere something utterly different is needed .
stability will come only when economic opportunities exist , when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families , rather than seeking their fortune in violence .
we are seeing again and again that a foreign army , whether nato ’ s in afghanistan , america ’ s in iraq , israel ’ s in occupied palestine , or ethiopia ’ s in somalia , may win a battle , or even a war , but never the peace .
peace is about dignity and hope for the future .
military occupation saps dignity , and grinding poverty and economic disarray sap hope .
peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops , and the arrival of jobs , productive farms and factories , tourism , health care , and schools .
without these , military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes .
the united states government has proven itself blind to these facts , but the international community also remains ill equipped to assist in the restoration of peace following conflicts in impoverished countries .
repeatedly , a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow-up .
despite grand promises of foreign aid , economic reconstruction , and development in afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , and elsewhere , the actual record of international assistance to post-war reconstruction is gravely deficient .
the scenario has become painfully familiar .
a war ends .
an international donors ’ conference is called .
pledges of billions of dollars are announced .
a smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community , including the occupying power .
months pass .
world bank teams from washington start to arrive .
but actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed , perhaps for years .
crony businesses from the us and europe , which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions , squander time , aid funds , and opportunities .
two or three years pass .
the grand pronouncements become a pile of out-of-date world bank studies .
recriminations fly , the occupying army remains , and a new insurgency spreads .
many factors contribute to this disarray , beginning with the shocking inability of the us , europe , and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people .
their lack of empathy is deplorable , but there are conceptual problems as well .
the international agencies involved in post-conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or restart economic development in a low-income setting .
it ’ s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict .
in the first phase , during the war itself , aid is for humanitarian relief , focusing on food , water , emergency medicine , and refugee camps .
in the second phase , at the war ’ s end , aid remains mainly humanitarian relief , but now directed towards displaced people returning home , and to decommissioned soldiers .
in the third phase , lasting three to five years , aid supports the first phase of post-war economic development , including restoration of schools , clinics , farms , factories , and ports .
in the fourth phase , which can last a generation or more , assistance is directed to long-term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts .
the international community , and the us in particular , is dreadful at the third stage .
once a conflict is over , aid agencies seem paralyzed .
instead of sending help , they send study groups .
by the time such help actually arrives , it is often too late : war has been re-ignited .
in fact , it is possible to restart economic development through targeted “ quick-impact ” initiatives .
since the economies of most impoverished post-conflict countries are based on agriculture , restarting farm output is vital .
impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds , fertilizers , and low-cost equipment ( such as pumps for irrigation ) .
when such aid is made available quickly , former soldiers will return to their farms , and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities .
this type of aid does not require long studies , but quick action .
similar quick-impact measures should be undertaken to control disease .
small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly , within the first year of peace .
solar panels and wind turbines can provide off-grid power in isolated rural areas . wells and cisterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water .
these and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security , epidemic disease and health , income and utter poverty , and , most importantly , hope and despair .
yet the window of opportunity closes quickly .
quick-impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in darfur .
sanctions , threats , and peacekeepers are only short-term measures , whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable , but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on .
the same applies in somalia .
but the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post-conflict regions .
only by taking quick , meaningful action to fight hunger , poverty , and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace .

winning the transition
washington , dc – is the arab spring turning into a gloomy autumn ?
with brutal crackdowns in syria , a bloody civil war in libya , and yemen teetering on the brink of chaos , the number of skeptics is growing .
although egypt and tunisia ’ s pro-democracy movements achieved rapid regime change , uncertainties remain in those countries , too .
after a brief period of hope , many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable , and economically vibrant , democracies .
revolutions and their after@@ ma@@ ths , of course , are always fluid and fickle times , and the outcome is often perched on a knife ’ s edge .
bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself .
redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well , fraught with volatility , uncertainty , and the dangers of political opportunism .
but transitions are also times of great opportunity .
in the 1990 ’ s , i was among those indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat , suharto , and i joined the new government when he left .
many observers predicted that indonesia , the world ’ s most populous muslim country , would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos .
the task ahead of us was daunting .
but we proved the skeptics wrong , and learned some fundamental lessons .
perhaps most importantly , we learned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for democratization .
each of the countries of the middle east and north africa will face unique challenges , which will have to be addressed on their own terms .
even so , they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past .
the new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished .
change must be formally manifested , with new laws that are widely publicized .
legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression , free and independent elections , and freedom of association is crucial , and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law .
anything less will undermine the transition .
moreover , corruption is the bane of development everywhere , so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it .
transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near-universal support , which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult .
civil-society organizations , local communities , representatives of the poor and vulnerable , and women play a vital role in this regard , and they should be included at every level of decision-making .
in indonesia , we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months , covering everything from media freedom to elections , corruption , decentralization , and anti-trust rules .
we ratified new public-finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country ’ s central bank .
in post-revolutionary times , expectations are high , and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous .
i know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes .
we had to compromise and settle for the best possible results .
security threats are among the most serious setbacks in transitions .
nationalistic sentiment is strong , and politicians and interest groups can exploit it .
often , the security forces are holdovers from the old regime , and there is no independent judicial system .
reforms will take time , and the old bureaucracies may not be able to implement them .
in indonesia , we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas .
for example , we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts , because career judges were too tainted .
likewise , when we started cash-for-work programs as part of our pro-poor agenda , we asked communities to run these initiatives .
more broadly , new leaders are well advised to ensure that the economy performs well .
it is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs , particularly small and medium-size businesses , which constitute the main engine of job creation .
the recent revolutions , it should be recalled , started with the self-immolation of a tunisian fruit vendor , who was harassed and insulted by the authorities .
but economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable , and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable .
they might have to abolish mis-@@ targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti-poverty and job-creation programs .
in indonesia , we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near-poor .
our help had to be targeted .
this was a tough and unpopular choice .
finally , countries in transition need support – not only money , but also technical know-how to implement highly complex reforms .
when i became indonesia ’ s finance minister , i had 64,000 employees .
but when we had to modernize our tax system , we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country .
yes , we needed external assistance , but we never surrendered “ ownership ” of the reform process ; we made it work for us .
if we indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition , it could easily have failed .
that lesson , too , is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind .

winning with opium in afghanistan
despite considerable effort by the international community in afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the taliban and al qaeda , the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months .
our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the afghan people – the taliban are .
indeed , the international community ’ s methods of fighting the insurgency and eradicating poppy crops have actually helped the insurgents gain power .
the international community has so far pursued policies of destruction , rather than the promised reconstruction .
the aggressive united states-led counter-narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of afghans , because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers , with their only livelihood destroyed , are unable to feed their families .
this has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country ’ s poorest areas .
at the same time , communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns , which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect .
this , in addition to four years of drought , has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps .
you do not win people over by bombing them , but by helping them .
the taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti-western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in afghanistan .
sadly , our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their lives .
it is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the afghan people .
international troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment , but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone .
with public perception a crucial factor in winning the war , and the taliban poised to launch a large military initiative next spring , failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signify the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable afghanistan .
but a successful strategy – one that responds to afghanistan ’ s extreme poverty crisis – requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication .
in fact , the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community ’ s goals , but it is also failing : opium production last year was at an all-time high .
in september , the united nations office on drugs crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record-high 60 % .
eradication will never be successful in afghanistan , because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south ’ s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people .
so a new , long-term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population .
as a way to address this dilemma , the senlis council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for afghanistan , which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process .
a system in which poppy is cultivated under license for the production of pain-@@ killing medicines such as morphine and codeine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional livelihood and way of life , and , more importantly , to feed themselves and their families .
there is a global shortage of morphine and codeine , particularly in underdeveloped countries , where these vital medicines are often in short supply , if not completely unavailable .
not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of afghanistan ; it also would stabilize existing local structures , giving communities a reason to support president hamid karzai ’ s government and the international community .
farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts , in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un-@@ achievable – policy of crop eradication .
we must have the backing of the afghan people if we are to defeat the taliban .
by endorsing such an initiative , the international community would demonstrate that it is in afghanistan for the good of the local population , which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency .
but for such a system to be successful , the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority .
according to the world food program , 70 % of the population lack food security .
an immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence .
only then could a new , long-term development strategy in afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war , and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented .
licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy ’ s success .

withdrawing from the war on drugs
geneva – switzerland ’ s direct democracy allows citizens who have gathered enough petition signatures to challenge government policies and laws in nationwide referenda .
after a spate of aids deaths during the 1980 ’ s , the swiss came face to face with a problem that has destroyed millions of lives in the united states , russia , latin america , the european union , southern asia , and other regions .
intravenous drug users – especially heroin addicts – had turned public spaces in zurich and other swiss cities and towns into needle parks . aids proved itself to be blind to affluence .
the swiss did not respond with the kind of neglect that russia ’ s government has shown so far toward its heroin and hiv epidemics – more than two million drug users and an estimated one million people living with hiv , over 60 % of them infected while sharing contaminated needles . nor did the swiss react with a “ war on drugs ” and massive funding for more policing , more jails , and mandatory prison sentences .
that war is well and truly lost .
the us now incarcerates more people than any other country , largely as a result of soaring drug convictions , with a disproportionate number of african-american and hispanic prisoners . the war on drugs has enabled drug cartels to reap higher profits than ever and transform entire communities in latin america into fiefdoms .
drug money is corrupting democratic governments and law-enforcement institutions around the world .
drug-related violence has consumed untold numbers of victims in afghanistan , burma , colombia , the us , and mexico .
the swiss re-examined their government ’ s drug policies with a pragmatic eye .
health professionals took the lead in a campaign to press the government – through the mechanisms of direct democracy – to shift its focus from arresting and punishing drug users toward public-health policies that are based on scientific evidence of what works .
the swiss implemented methadone program@@ s. and , in order to prevent the spread of hiv , they created needle exchanges , including in prisons , and established safe injection rooms on a large scale .
the swiss federal office of public health also oversaw an experiment in prescribing heroin to people who had lived with opiate dependency for significant periods .
the swiss government ’ s careful evaluation of this approach demonstrated that heroin-assisted therapy is both feasible and cost-effective , and that it can bring patients significant health improvements .
moreover , it contributed to a startling drop in drug-related crime .
the swiss public was so convinced of the benefits of heroin-assisted therapy that , in two nationwide votes , voters endorsed the policy , despite domestic political opposition and criticism from the international narcotics control board .
switzerland is a conservative country .
trafficking in illicit narcotics remains illegal .
in november 2008 , the swiss rejected a proposal for dutch-@@ style decriminalization of cannabis .
and some policymakers question whether the swiss approach has focused drug policy too much on public health and too little on dealing with the poverty and social exclusion faced by drug users .
switzerland ’ s pragmatic approach to drug abuse has nonetheless yielded significant lessons that are applicable to the us , russia , and the many other drug- and hiv / aids-@@ ravaged countries over which they wield significant influence .
so have similar approaches in portugal , which only a decade ago led the eu in drug-related hiv / aids cases .
portugal ’ s decision in 2001 to decriminalize possession of illegal drugs led not only to more drug users in treatment ( rather than in prison ) , but also a significant decrease in the number of drug users newly infected with hiv .
one lesson is the crucial importance of using scientifically rigorous investigation of new programs – rather than populist rhetoric , religious moralizing , and urban myth – to guide policymaking .
this requires coordinating policing and health programs within a coherent policy framework , investing in research and public education on drug policy , opening new programs to independent review , and standing up to ideological criticism , both domestic and international , with evidence and pragmatism .
to convey these and other significant lessons , and to advocate worldwide for effective harm-reduction policies – and for broader public debate about more efficient and humane drug policies – we and other world leaders have initiated the global commission on drug policy , which held its inaugural meeting in geneva in january .
our aim is to show that the war on drugs is lost .
switzerland , portugal , and other countries have demonstrated that there is a better way forward , combining pragmatism and cost effectiveness with compassion and respect for human rights .

germany ’ s same old foreign policy
munich – more than ten weeks after its general election , germany continues to be without a new government .
but , though the post-election coalition negotiations have been unusually prolonged , there is little disagreement between the parties over foreign and security policy .
except for a few tweaks that generally resonate more at home than with germany ’ s european and international partners ( such as requiring the government to be more transparent concerning arms exports to autocratic regimes ) , continuity and caution will remain the watchwords of german foreign and security policy .
observers may disagree about whether german leaders ’ stance provides a welcome sign of reliability or reflects a lamentable lack of diplomatic ambition .
those who hope for more active german leadership may well be disappointed by the new government .
big ideas , or even big questions , are notably absent from the coalition agreement .
this is very much a reflection of many germans ’ views about themselves and their future : they are comfortable with the status quo , see no need for further reform proposals , are not interested in grand strategy , and would largely prefer to be left alone .
successive german governments have maintained that the alliance should be , or even is , the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges .
but germany has at times been rather reluctant to take crisis issues to nato headquarters .
and when it comes to provision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls “ our geographic neighborhood , ” the incoming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job .
or consider the question of turkey ’ s accession to the european union .
continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not permit a proactive german role .
instead , the compromise solution will be no solution : neither yes nor no .
at the same time , some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement .
for starters , the united states ’ strategic “ pivot ” to the asia-pacific region is described as an opportunity for europe to assert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region .
moreover , to encourage this outcome , the coalition agreement promises that the government will “ adopt new initiatives to strengthen and deepen the common foreign and security policy ” after the eu summit in december 2013 .
it includes a call for an annual european council session on security and defense , as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of eu foreign relations .
in addition , the german government will support european defense integration and maintain the establishment of a european army as a long-term goal .
this may not amount to much in practice , but the language in this section is much less tepid than elsewhere .
finally , the coalition agreement responds to concerns about germany ’ s ability to be a reliable partner in nato and eu military missions in a potentially more integrated eu defense organization .
however , germany ’ s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the german parliament were to retain a veto over their deployment .
the coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue .
nonetheless , they have agreed that , within a year , a commission will provide different options and models to protect the german parliament ’ s rights while providing assurances to germany ’ s european partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments .
should the spd , which will vote on the coalition agreement in early december , block the formation of the new government ( an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question ) , disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit .
aside from a few minor particulars , consensus prevails .
“ i do not like the idea that germany plays itself up to impose its will on others , ” german president joachim gauck said recently . “ yet neither do i like the idea that germany plays itself down to eschew risks or solidarity . ”
to some degree , the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessity to assume more responsibility for international leadership .
but it will respond ever so slowly and ever so carefully .
the bottom line is this : expect no surprises from germany .
considering how difficult it has been for some , if not most , other eu countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years , that is actually rather good news .

wolfowitz and the world bank at bay
will world bank president paul wolfowitz ’ s troubles finally catalyze real change at the world bank ?
will there finally be an end to the archaic practice by which the president of the united states unilaterally appoints the head of the world ’ s most important development agency ?
facing an extraordinary rebuke from the bank ’ s ministerial oversight committee and open revolt from his professional staff , wolfowitz has faint hope of limping through the last three years of his term .
the immediate uproar is over the exceedingly generous pay and promotion package that wolfowitz awarded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compensation for leaving the bank to pave the way for his arrival .
at a time when the bank has been emphasizing high governance standards as the key to development , the recent revelation of that arrangement ’ s details have dealt a serious blow to the bank ’ s credibility .
but even if wolfowitz is eventually forced to resign , nothing will be gained if us president george w. bush is allowed summarily to choose his replacement , as us presidents have been doing ever since the bank was founded after world war ii .
instead , the bank ’ s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best-qualified candidate , whether from the us , europe , or the developing world .
indeed , a big part of wolfowitz ’ s weakness today is the way he came to his job , as an in-your-face appointment from a us administration weak at international cooperation .
the world bank is a development finance institution .
but wolfowitz ’ s background at the us state and defense departments gave him no real expertise or experience in either area .
instead , his claim to fame was his role as architect of america ’ s failed war in iraq .
by all accounts , wolfowitz is brilliant , but it seems inconceivable that an open , transparent , and multilateral selection process would have chosen him to head the world bank .
i reach this conclusion even though i am sympathetic to the bush administration ’ s desire to catalyze change at the bank .
i have long advocated shifting the bank ’ s center of gravity from lending to outright grants , a policy that the bush administration strongly endorses .
but choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front .
a more open selection process , indeed , would have zo@@ omed in on the fact that wolfowitz ’ s girlfriend worked at the bank .
this may seem a trivial issue , but it is not , given the bank ’ s strong policies to protect against nepotism .
if wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate , the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue , openly and transparently .
but , given his questionable fit for the job in the first place , the girlfriend issue might have been disqualifying .
why does the world meekly go along with the status quo and let the us dictate the bank ’ s top position ?
it is a sorry tale of poor global governance .
europe does not get in america ’ s way because it wants to maintain europe ’ s equally out-dated privilege of appointing the head of the international monetary fund , the bank ’ s sister institution .
asia has little choice but to defer to the us and europe ’ s shenanigans because it is grossly under-represented in both organizations .
as for africa , its leaders are loath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of world bank largesse .
many people , including myself , have long complained about the leadership selection process at the world bank and the imf .
how can the bank and the fund continue to go around lecturing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses ?
now and again , both organizations pay lip service to the issue .
but so far , they have exhibited no real desire for change .
to be fair , the imf ’ s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies , particularly in asia , a bigger say in fund governance .
if carried far enough , this process would ultimately catalyze the necessary changes .
unfortunately , the imf ’ s rebalancing efforts are proceeding at a glacial pace .
at the world bank , nothing seems to be happening at all .
perhaps when gordon brown becomes the uk ’ s next prime minister , he will be able to convince the g7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change .
as head of the fund ’ s ministerial oversight committee , brown understands the issues as well as anyone .
or perhaps the wolfowitz debacle will prove to be the catalyst .
maybe at last , the next world bank or imf president will come from outside their usual domains .
there are plenty of great potential non-american candidates .
south african finance minister trevor manuel has ably served as head of the world bank ’ s oversight committee and would make a brilliant world bank president .
and it still could be a qualified american .
what about bill clinton ?
one way or the other , the bank and the imf leadership selection process urgently needs to be revamped .
what the wolfowitz debacle tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over .

women and development
copenhagen – a girl born in south asia or sub-saharan africa faces a cruel double burden .
she will grow up in a region beset by poverty , disease , war or famine . she will also confront these challenges with the added disadvantage of being female .
although more attention is being given to gender issues , inequality persists in every culture , country , and continent .
a new study for the copenhagen consensus project shows that eliminating this disparity is an investment with high payoffs .
despite global interest in education for all , many girls in poor countries continue to be denied basic education ; right from the start , they are disadvantaged .
three in five illiterate children in the world are girls .
particularly in south asia and sub-saharan africa , cultural norms and economic hardships stop parents from sending their daughters to school or from keeping them in school for as long as they enroll their sons .
this unequal investment is neither equitable nor efficient .
an obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately .
in poor muslim countries like pakistan , yemen , and morocco , single-sex schooling is the norm , but many rural areas can afford only one public school , which is usually set aside for boys .
in theory , about half of the education gap in these areas could be closed by building girls ’ schools .
elsewhere , supply constraints are not the problem .
instead , policymakers must find ways to strengthen the incentives for parents to send their daughters to school .
in countries where the family ’ s cost of schooling girls is lowered either by a no-@@ fee policy or by a stipend for girls who enroll in school , girls ’ enrollment rate increases .
the experiences of these few countries lead us to propose a system whereby mothers are paid if their school-age daughters attend school regularly from the 3rd to the 9th grade .
this would increase girls ’ enrollment and also put money into women ’ s hands – important because studies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive nutritional and health benefits for their children than money given to men .
it also provides the women with greater bargaining power in their own households .
the annual cost per pupil would be $ 32 .
covering every eligible girl in sub-saharan africa and south asia for a year would cost $ 6 billion .
benefits from increased future wages and the reduction in health-care use would be between three and 26 times higher .
pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women ; 99 % of the 52@@ 9,000 women who die annually from pregnancy-related complications live in developing countries .
severe malnutrition and the absence of prenatal care during pregnancy put both mother and child at serious risk .
spending $ 3.9 billion on family planning and maternal health initiatives , such as provision of emergency contraception in sub-saharan africa and south asia , could avert 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths in women .
making reproductive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these deaths .
but such services must not shy away from promoting and providing modern contraceptive methods to avoid unwanted pregnancies .
nearly 20 % of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contraception or family planning , possibly because reproductive services are not available .
for adolescent girls , early marriage or an unwanted pregnancy typically curtails schooling .
delaying marriage and childbearing allows them to gain more education and perhaps more earning opportunities , as well as improved health , education , and labor market success for their future children – benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing reproductive services .
other tools , aside from schooling , can help women improve their income-@@ earning ability .
microfinance institutions , such as bangladesh ’ s grameen bank , play a vital role in allowing self-employed women to build profitable businesses .
small loans empower women by giving them more control over household assets and resources , more autonomy and decision-making power , and greater access to participation in public life .
women are more likely than men to meet regular repayments and to spend their earnings on children ’ s health and education .
policymakers should continue to facilitate the rollout of microfinance programs .
studies show that each dollar loaned by a microfinance institution increases household expenditure by almost 10 % in the first year , and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years . benefits are estimated to end up about six times higher than the costs .
though women have the right to vote in almost every country , gender inequalities in political representation remain large .
governments should consider gender quotas at the local level of politics .
greater female representation may not necessarily lead to more emphasis on “ female ” policy priorities , but in india , village councils with gender quotas for village chiefs have higher levels of safe drinking water , better immunization coverage and roads , and less bribery .
there may be some losses from electing women because they tend to have less political experience than men , but the record in india suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 30 % share of women in local positions in other countries , the benefits would be at least double the costs of achieving this .
being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life .

copenhagen – the past decade has proven again and again that empowering women worldwide holds the key to solving many seemingly intractable issues that have otherwise stymied policymakers .
poverty in the developing world seemed ineradicable until micro-@@ lenders saw millions of low-income , destitute women as potential entrepreneurs .
involving african women in decision-making about crop production turns out to enable environmentally sustainable farming practices .
runaway population growth becomes controllable when women have access to literacy and business opportunities as well as to contraception .
could the tensions and conflicts surrounding the issue of immigration in europe be yet another issue for which the empowerment of women holds a solution ?
in a recent visit to copenhagen to commemorate international women ’ s day , i took part in many conversations that duplicate others throughout europe : citizens from across the political spectrum were struggling with the issue of non-european immigration and the cultural tensions that have ensued .
what does it mean to be danish , german , or french in the presence of these millions of newcomers , most of whom come from non-democratic societies ?
some of this anxiety is pure racism ; but some is not .
what would “ integration ” mean , and how is it achieved without the loss of cherished civil-society values ?
these are not necessarily xenophobic questions : a post-@@ enlightenment civil society , with a free press and due process , is a precious thing , and those values should not be sacrificed to politically correct moral relativism .
this issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet mohammed as a dog .
across europe , the discussions are growing more intense as anti-immigration platforms gain supporters in otherwise liberal countries , from germany to france to traditionally inclusive and tolerant denmark itself .
then i witnessed the prototype of a true solution .
i met elisabeth møller jensen , the director of kvinfo , “ the danish center for information on gender , equality and ethnicity ” – an extraordinary organization funded by denmark ’ s ministry of culture .
one of its many innovative programs is already showing results in terms of genuinely integrating immigrant families into danish society .
by addressing immigrant women – and by viewing them as potential leaders , rather than as quiescent potential maids or service workers – kvinfo is enabling their families to witness the benefits of an open civil society in their own lives .
by 2010 , it had 5,000 participants , had won awards and international acclaim for best integrative practices , and is being replicated throughout denmark – and observers are exploring programs or partnerships modeled upon it in canada , spain , portugal , and norway .
the program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one-to-one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of danish society .
the pairing is not cursory .
a careful matchmaking process unites the interests and goals of the women on both sides , and already has paid amazing dividends .
women who were journalists , engineers , or scientists in their countries of origin – and who could not get jobs as checkout cashiers in denmark – have been paired with danish counterparts and are now back in school , or working in research .
but even women who arrive with no higher education or professional skills create an “ action plan . ”
they learn from their mentors what options there are , how to proceed , and what to do to reach their objectives . as they enter the workforce , their language skills improve , their household income soars , and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected , economically valued role .
their loved ones thus learn how to thrive in a european context – occasionally coming to kvinfo events and benefiting from their mothers ’ expanding network of contacts .
so , rather than feeling exploited and condemned indefinitely to the fringes of a northern european society – and thus vulnerable to the stirrings of demagogues and extremists – these women ’ s children grow up fully familiar with danish civil society , well informed about higher education and professional opportunities , and hopeful rather than cynical .
by empowering women , the whole family is lifted up and , in a supportive rather than a colonizing way , “ europeanized ” in the best sense .
i am often struck by the way many europeans use arms-length euphemisms when talking about immigrants : they want immigrants to feel “ welcome ” or “ comfortable . ”
i always wonder , “ but do you want them to feel french , or german , or norwegian ? ”
to be fully integrated , muslim and other newcomers to european countries must be welcomed not as perpetual visitors – even if , ideally , as nicely treated visitors – but rather as family members , as the american model does ( or aspires to do ) .
as møller jensen put it , “ i want these children to feel danish . ” these young people and denmark itself will benefit , as this “ kvinfo generation ” grows up with a genuine stake in danish civil society , and seeing the world as danes , not as guests .

arab women ’ s unfinished revolution
fez – though women across the middle east participated actively in the arab spring protests that began in late 2010 , they remain second-class citizens , even where popular uprisings managed to topple autocratic regimes .
indeed , the islamist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the despots that they replaced to keep women out of politics .
in conducting interviews with women in the region , i am struck by their overall pessimism .
they fear the loss of their rights .
they see economic disintegration all around them , raising the possibility of a further increase in violence .
as social bonds fray , they feel increasingly vulnerable .
more than once , i heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions .
female representation in parliaments and government cabinets after the arab spring has been either absent or meager , and women activists worry that islamist parties will implement reactionary policies that discriminate on the basis of gender .
in egypt , for example , the freedom and justice party , which dominates the parliament , claims that a woman cannot become president .
egyptian women were heavily represented in the protests that brought down former president hosni mubarak ’ s regime in 2011 , but they have been largely excluded from any official decision-making role ever since .
in morocco , while there were eight@@ women in the previous cabinet , today there is only one in the islamist-led government .
in january , the islamist-dominated parliament adopted a decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16 , a major setback .
moroccan feminists have protested vigorously , but to no avail .
parliamentary representation for women has also taken a hit .
women hold less than 1 % of seats in the current egyptian parliament ; previously , they held 12 % .
in libya , a first draft of the electoral law reserved 10 % of seats in the constituent assembly for women , but the quota was later abandoned .
in tunisia , the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-@@ seat constituent assembly .
but 42 of these women are members of ennahda , which regards sharia ( islamic law ) as the source of legislation .
long-time tunisian activists fear that ennahda , which dominates the assembly , will use the presence of women mps to restrict women ’ s rights .
the recent assassination of the secular tunisian opposition leader chokri belaid has raised the stakes for women there .
belaid was a voice on behalf of women ’ s rights , and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all tunisians , including women .
unfortunately , conservative forces in the arab world repeatedly turn against women when political unrest spreads .
in bahrain , several women protesters have been arrested and tortured .
in yemen , the authorities call on male relatives to “ tame ” their women .
in tunisia , the most westernized of the arab countries , women have been attacked at universities and schools , and are being forced to wear the hijab .
a woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen in september 2012 was charged with public in@@ decency when she filed a complaint .
likewise , in egypt , women protesters face greater scrutiny than men .
those arrested by the military during the anti-mubarak protests were subjected to virginity tests as a form of intimidation .
across the middle east , islamist militias have harassed , arrested , raped , and tortured women pro-democracy activists .
the model of iran ’ s islamic revolution in 1979 , which imposed second-class citizenship on women , is frequently cited as a threat in arab countries now ruled by islamist parties .
these countries are at a crossroads .
women make up half of the middle east ’ s population , and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact .
organizations like the united nations development program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppression of women .
simply put , the arab countries will not succeed unless women are fully integrated into political and economic life .
in her nobel peace prize acceptance speech in 2011 , yemeni political activist tawakkol karman , made the point clearly : “ the solution to women ’ s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated , the energy of both women and men together . ”
middle eastern countries should protect and consolidate women ’ s rights as a way to reinforce democratic ideas and habits .
they must institute the universal declaration of human rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence .
the hope for women ’ s progress is really a hope for a decent society in which development for all is possible .

a woman ’ s place is in the digital revolution
montreal – digital technologies are a double-edged sword for the world ’ s women .
men ’ s greater access to these technologies puts women at risk of being left even further behind economically and socially .
but if women can tap the full power of digital technologies , vital new opportunities will open up for them .
according to estimates by the gsm association , women ’ s access to the internet and mobile phones is about 85 % of the level for men , on average , and a total of 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries are unconnected .
this severely limits the prospects of women and girls .
digital technologies enhance women ’ s access to finance , with mobile banking enabling them to avoid long journeys to a branch or atm .
likewise , technology-enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes , as it reaches women even in the remotest areas , sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor .
the times@@ aving potential of digital technologies is so great that they may make the difference in enabling women to seek paid employment .
today , women undertake three-quarters of all unpaid care work , producing output of around $ 10 trillion , or 13 % of global gdp – none of which is translated into income , let alone economic power .
by their nature , e-commerce and technology-based businesses offer women more flexibility and autonomy , helping them to manage home responsibilities alongside paid work .
in indonesia , women-owned businesses generate 35 % of e-commerce revenue , compared with only 15 % of the revenue of offline businesses .
likewise , in china , 55 % of new internet businesses are founded by women , and alibaba ’ s taobao e-commerce platform has an equal number of male and female store owners .
in fact , china is home to 114 of the world ’ s 147 self-made female billionaires , compared to just 14 in the second-place country , the united states .
women ’ s economic empowerment is good not just for the women who benefit .
the mckinsey global institute ( mgi ) has estimated that advancing gender equality could add $ 12 trillion per year to the world economy by 2025 .
in the asia-pacific region alone , getting more women into full-time employment in higher-paid , higher-productivity sectors could add $ 4.5 trillion per year to gdp , 12 % above the current trajectory .
at the company level , a growing body of evidence shows that more gender equality is good for bottom lines .
greater diversity of leadership styles improves the quality of decision-making .
if given the opportunity , women could be leading innovators in the age of automation and artificial intelligence , and could help to ensure that algorithms are free of gender bias .
for example , in india , where only 29 % of all internet users are female , girls in rural areas often face gender-based restrictions on their use of information and communications technologies .
one village in uttar pradesh implemented a fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside the home .
beyond the social attitudes that undermine women ’ s access to digital technologies , women and girls often disproportionately lack the requisite skills to seize the opportunities of the digital age .
in singapore , for example , women lag behind men in education in science , math , engineering , and technology .
at nanyang technological university , females comprised only 27 % of the undergraduate computer-science program in 2015-2016 , despite accounting for half of all undergraduates at the university .
what is at stake is not just women ’ s ability to seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution , but also their capacity to withstand the coming wave of automation .
according to mgi research , in singapore alone , 800,000 full-@@ time-@@ equivalent jobs could be displaced by 2030 due to automation .
the jobs that are most vulnerable to automation are the low-paid , lower-skill jobs that women are more likely to hold .
at the same time , though automation risks disrupting many jobs ( or tasks within jobs ) for both men and women , it also takes some of the drudgery out of current work , tailoring it to human abilities .
the result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 300-365 million worldwide – as spending increases , with emerging economies gaining the most .
furthermore , among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care , where women have traditionally thrived .
according to mgi research , more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10-15 years as health care and education needs grow .
it is not yet clear exactly how automation will affect women ’ s employment .
but there is no doubt that protecting – and even enhancing – women ’ s job and income prospects will require upgrading their skills , so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution .
the success of women in e-commerce attests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field , to the benefit of individual women , their communities and societies , and the world economy .
more women in work – particularly in the technology industries that are shaping our collective future – would be good news for all .

the media ’ s # metoo problem
london – journalism classrooms may be dominated by women , but global media are still ruled by men , who occupy the majority of management positions , report more news stories and are more frequently presented as expert voices .
this imbalance is reflected in the content newsrooms produce , with fewer written words and broadcast seconds dedicated to telling women ’ s stories .
it is also reflected in the industry ’ s culture , which leaves women more vulnerable to sexual harassment and abuse .
given the importance of relation@@ ship-building in media , not to mention the desire for connection among journalists who cover extreme or harrowing events in difficult environments , intimate ties can easily form among colleagues and associates .
the problem arises when these relationships turn sour or , worse , when they are non-@@ consensual or based on coercion , such as when a more senior colleague pursues a sexual relationship with a subordinate .
of course , across countries , there can be significant differences in what is considered predatory or inappropriate behavior .
but , globally , almost half of women journalists report having experienced work-related sexual harassment , according to a 2014 study by the international news safety institute ( insi ) and the international women ’ s media foundation ( iwmf ) .
two-thirds reported that they had faced “ intimidation , threats , or abuse , ” mostly by bosses , supervisors , or co-workers .
for perpetrators , impunity remains the norm .
almost three-fifths of respondents in the insi / iwmf study who had experienced harassment said that they had reported incidents to their employers .
in most cases , however , it was the women who experienced the abuse who suffered adverse consequences : damaged reputations and career prospects , not to mention the impact on their psychological and emotional wellbeing .
so while men with histories of predatory behavior continue to occupy senior positions in the global news industry , women journalists are pushed to the point that they consider leaving it .
in a recent survey by the iwmf and trollbusters , one-third of respondents said that they had considered abandoning journalism ; those at earlier stages in their careers were twice as likely to say that they were considering work in other fields because of the threats and attacks they received , in person or online .
despite the obstacles they face , more women appear to be rising in the ranks of the global media industry , even though progress is relatively slow .
in digital newsrooms , which often have fewer of the inherent inequities of legacy media , the number of women in leadership positions appears to be growing faster .
however , the “ bro ” culture in certain newer newsrooms carries its own sexual harassment risks for women .
meanwhile , in the united states , several high-profile male journalists have lost their jobs in the last year over allegations of inappropriate behavior toward their female colleagues – part of the broader # metoo movement .
but , overall , newsrooms continue to fail to take seriously the threats female journalists face on the job , both in their own workplaces and in the field .
while newsrooms conduct risk assessment and deployment discussions regarding journalists in the field – where women can be particularly vulnerable to unwelcome advances from male colleagues , contacts , or strangers – they rarely account for the specific threats women face , at least not in a sufficiently nuanced way .
this may be partly because , for major news organizations , these assessments are often handled in consultation with safety advisers – usually former military men , who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face .
sometimes , the safety advisers turn out to be perpetrators of sexual harassment .
anecdotally , i know of several journalists who have been sexually harassed by safety advisers .
depending on where this takes place , such behavior can have significant security implications .
as if that were not enough pressure , female foreign correspondents who are assaulted in the field often find themselves at the center of debates about whether women should be deployed on certain stories at all .
male correspondents are never the subjects of such debates .
this macho myopia reinforces the damaging imbalance in perspectives shaping the media .
it also carries significant economic costs .
as the harvard business review put it , “ we all pay the price ” when sexual harassment continues or is covered up .
by impeding women from advancing within the industry or compelling them to change jobs , harassment diminishes their earning potential and deprives society of the best use of its talents .
the fact is that journalists of various genders , ethnicities , and backgrounds experience different environments differently , in terms of both the risks they face and the rewards they can reap .
any assessment of a story needs to account for that nuance , with managers choosing the best journalist for the job – and providing the support needed to keep all journalists safe .
to change the organizational culture that has enabled harassment and other forms of abuse against women – a moral obligation , as well as a legal and economic imperative – newsroom managers must lead from the top .
change will not happen overnight , nor will it be driven by a single actor .
leaders should listen to the women in their ranks , and invite diverse perspectives to help effect change .
the goal is not to pit young against old or women against men .
it is to rectify the media industry ’ s failure to protect its most vulnerable workers .
we all pay when that failure prevents women journalists from achieving their full potential .

it ’ s time to let women thrive
davos – in public debates around the world , women ’ s empowerment is increasingly being recognized as a top priority .
the question of how to provide more economic opportunities for women is firmly on the agenda at the world economic forum ’ s annual meeting in davos this year .
and longtime advocates for women are feeling energized , as countless others – men and women alike – have come to recognize the urgency of the task .
affording women and girls the opportunity to succeed is not just the right thing to do ; it can also transform societies and economies for the good of all .
for example , bringing women ’ s labor force participation up to the same level as that of men would boost gdp by as much as 9 % in japan and 27 % in india .
the international monetary fund has documented many other macroeconomic benefits associated with women ’ s empowerment .
reducing gender gaps in employment and education has been shown to help economies diversify their exports .
appointing more women to banking-supervision boards can prevent cozy groupthink , thereby ensuring greater stability and resilience in the financial sector .
closing the gender gap may seem like a tall order , but it is essential for long-term economic development and prosperity .
the challenge for every country , then , is to make the most of all of its people ’ s talents .
realizing women ’ s potential is a universal mission .
but some of the barriers holding women back are also universal . astonishingly , almost 90 % of countries have one or more gender-based legal restrictions on the books .
in some countries , women still have limited property rights compared to men ; in others , husbands have the right to forbid their wives from working .
beyond legal barriers , women also face social and cultural obstacles that limit their access to education , work , and finance .
this is especially true in countries with fragile political systems .
now that public awareness of is growing , it is time to press ahead with concrete measures to help women remain in the workforce while raising a family .
for a glimpse of what that might look like , consider norway , where affordable childcare and par@@ ental-@@ leave schemes have proven successful in enabling both mothers and fathers to work .
yes , these programs are costly .
but they are well worth the investment , given employed women ’ s enormous contribution to economic growth .
moreover , programs that help women keep working also change the role of fathers .
in norway and other countries with similar policies , fathers now share equally in parental leave and child-rearing .
as a result , more women can pursue leadership roles in work and public life .
of course , countries that are not yet at norway ’ s level of economic development typically face other gender-related challenges , including limited access to water and education .
unfortunately , while many countries have made progress in reducing gender gaps in primary-school enrollment , there is still much more work to be done at the secondary and tertiary levels .
as long as these gaps persist , women will not be able to aspire to political and economic power on an equal footing with men .
accordingly , norway has made girls ’ education a top priority in its international-@@ development programs .
beyond education , ensuring that women in developing countries have access to finance is critical , because it enables them to participate fully in the economy , including as entrepreneurs .
when women are empowered to start their own businesses , they can drive innovation and help their countries prosper .
because women ’ s labor-force participation is so important for growth , organizations such as the imf are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically .
imf-supported programs in egypt and jordan , for example , include measures to boost investment in public nurseries and safe public transportation .
in addition to specific policies , today ’ s conversation has increasingly focused on the need for wider social change .
and now that movements such as # equalpay and # metoo have gained so much momentum , it looks like that change could be coming .
it has been inspiring to see so many women , girls , and – yes – men speaking out against retrograde attitudes toward women , which have been holding all of us back .
with the global economy recovering , governments must now lay the foundation for long-term growth , by creating the conditions for women everywhere to realize their full potential .
discrimination and abuse against women can no longer stand .
it is time for women to thrive .

women on top ?
what will g-8 summit meetings be like when american president hillary clinton and french president ségolène royal join german chancellor angela merkel in a formidable triangle of women ’ s power ?
the scenario is not altogether unlikely .
indeed , in the united states and france , there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency ( condoleezza rice in america , michelle alliot-marie in france ) .
will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations ?
the answer is not obvious .
after all , some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top .
think of indira gandhi , golda meir , or margaret thatcher .
all three were powerful prime ministers of their countries , though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values .
they all out@@ did men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism .
indeed , another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned .
when it comes to the formation of governments , women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains , such as education and social affairs .
foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration .
both the us and the european union have women leading their foreign offices ; so do half a dozen eu countries , including britain .
has this changed the style , indeed , the substance of foreign policy ?
undoubtedly , a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world .
in a word , it appears that the reagan-thatcher period is over .
while opponents of globalization still fight “ neo-liberal ” policies , political discourse has taken a new turn .
words like “ justice ” are back in fashion ; there is concern about globalization ’ s losers and the “ underclass . ”
somehow , people prefer “ softer ” values than were prevalent in the last two decades .
yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values .
merkel may have been softened by having to preside over a grand coalition , but her original stance was more of the reagan-thatcher variety .
yuliya tymoshenko was clearly the most stou@@ thearted among the leaders of ukraine ’ s orange revolution , and no one has ever described hillary clinton as particularly “ soft . ”
on the contrary , her possible republican opponent in 2009 , senator john mccain , while a war hero , is also a man who represents to many americans the new soft values .
merkel had a difficult time in the run-up to her recent party conference , because jürgen rüttgers , the minister-@@ president of the largest german state , north-@@ rhine westphalia , reminded the christian democrats of their historical support for strong social-welfare policies .
only royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard-liner of the governing party , nicolas sarkozy .
so , have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics ?
whatever change they have brought has not been obvious .
in a sense , women ’ s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960 ’ s .
it took decades to become real , and there are still countries that have a long way to go .
despite tymoshenko ’ s leading role in ukraine , it would be surprising to see russian president vladimir putin replaced by a woman , and , while there is a female vice-president in china , there is no sign of a woman becoming japanese prime minister soon .
even so , in many parts of the world , women have made considerable headway on the path to the top .
not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies .
david cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40 % of all conservative parliamentary candidates in britain are women .
but this is precisely the point .
it is not the women at the top who have changed the scene .
rather , it is a more general trend , helped along by open-minded leaders of both sexes , that has changed the political climate in countries .
no one , man or woman , can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man ’ s game .
in other words , normalization by equal opportunity is itself the change .
whatever the particular values of leading candidates , this is undoubtedly progress .

through the lookism glass
new york – do women suffer from a double standard in the workplace in relation to how they look ?
have we gotten past the subtle ( and sometimes not-so-subtle ) shade of sexism in hiring and promotion – disproportionately affecting women – that i identified in 1991 as “ the professional beauty quotient ” ?
it is hard to believe that we are still talking about this 20 years later – but we must .
when anti-@@ feminists make the case that there is now a “ level playing field ” for women , and that any gender gap in achievement and pay reflects women ’ s own choices , they should consider what used to be called “ lookism . ”
in a recent commentary , the sociologist michael kimmel described an iowa case in which a 33-year-old dental technician , melissa nelson , was fired by her male boss , not for issues related to her job performance , but because he found her too sexually attractive to work beside without fear of jeopardizing his marital vows .
when nelson sued , the court issued a heinous ruling – upheld by the iowa supreme court – affirming his right to dismiss her for this reason .
one could argue that men , too , are promoted or penalized on the basis of their appearance ; indeed , economists have found that those with an “ above-average ” appearance earn 5 % more than their “ less attractive ” counterparts , and that workers with a “ below-average ” appearance earn 7-9 % less than their “ average ” counterparts .
to be fair , there is now a professional premium on male looks as well .
we all know that there is a reason that politicians spend $ 400 on haircuts and ceos boast about working out at dawn with personal trainers .
looking healthy , fit , youthful , and professional are now signs that male elites use to signal their status to one another in an advanced consumer and corporate economy .
but , as the nelson case shows , women are not just subjected to the straightforward – equally onerous – lookism that men , too , might face on the job .
young women , especially , suffer from discrimination in the workplace when they are seen as “ too ” aesthetically appealing .
many workplaces channel conventionally attractive young women into out-@@ front support , or subordinate , jobs , in which their appearance – as they bring coffee to high-status men in meetings – can add value to the corporate “ brand , ” though no value is being added to their own careers .
young women are put into these visible , cheerleader roles even when their professional development might be better suited to their being unseen in a lab , or slogging away over copy late at night , or addressing a room from a position of authority .
potentially worse is the beating their confidence takes as they spend their twenties worrying , as their male peers – however attractive – almost never do , that their ( generally minimal ) advancement reflects an evaluation of their looks , and is not tied to their accomplishments .
even more insidious is the reflex even today in major western media whereby attention is regularly directed to the appearance and sexuality of powerful women , especially those in politics .
the huffington post , an otherwise rational publication , ran a report about german chancellor angela merkel under the headline “ merkel ’ s cleavage takes center stage in german elections , ” while anti-merkel bloggers have called attention to merkel ’ s “ attractiveness gap . ”
germany ’ s die partei , established by the editors of the satirical magazine titanic , made light of the offensive trope , running a campaign under the slogan : “ a woman – yes !
but attractive . ”
the late christopher hitchens , by contrast , was not joking when he parsed margaret thatcher ’ s sex appeal .
this continual , rather fetishi@@ stic sexualizing of powerful women confirms the argument i made more than two decades ago in my book the beauty myth : women ’ s appearance is used against them most rigorously – as a diversionary tactic – when real social , economic , or political power is at stake and almost within their grasp .
it is doubtless demoralizing and distracting to an influential woman to be continually treated like a bimbo , or else told by major news outlets how unattractive , old , fat , or badly dressed she is .
this gauntlet of scrutiny is why young women with great leadership qualities are often reluctant to enter the public eye : they see this abuse , whether “ positive ” or negative , as a no-win proposition , one that powerful men simply do not face .
does the business press ever call jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon cute , or describe him as “ pou@@ ty , ” or remark on his good hair and nice abs , as though he were a male stripper ?
do they ever ask ben bernanke , “ what ’ s with the facial hair ?
it ’ s not 1979 . ”
do political reporters ever take newt gingrich to task for , say , being overweight , unfit , and a poor dre@@ sser ?
no media outlet would ever print such observations , which , when aimed at men , would appear insulting , inappropriately personal , and irrelevant .
so why is it still acceptable to run public commentary about the state of merkel ’ s cleavage , or hillary clinton ’ s ankles ?
we should try to imagine a world in which the jamie dimons and newt gingriches struggle daily to stay focused on their high-pressure jobs , while tor@@ rents of comment and attention are devoted to how “ hot ” and well-@@ dressed they are , or alternatively , how out of shape , middle-aged , and sexually unappealing they are .
many countries have government agencies whose job is to ensure that women – and men – do not face workplace discrimination on the basis of their appearance .
unfortunately , that task has not been completed .
but , because the media play a major role in perpetuating this double standard against women in the public eye , legislating or litigating against this kind of workplace harassment will not help .
sexist commentators have to scrutinize themselves ; if they do so honestly , they will not like what they see in the mirror .

washington , dc – on march 8 , the world will celebrate international women ’ s day , an annual opportunity to recommit to gender equality .
this year ’ s observance comes at an important time for women ’ s rights , as global movements like # metoo and # timesup are refocusing attention on the discriminatory practices that women confront in their social and professional lives .
but while women in the developed world are waging big battles over gender bias , women and girls in developing countries remain focused on smaller victories .
on this international women ’ s day , we must not forget that in the world ’ s poorest communities , poverty , hunger , domestic violence , and discrimination remain endemic obstacles to gender parity .
i have studied gender and development in the global south for 15 years .
my research , which has included thousands of interviews with women from india to burkina faso , has centered on one question : how can the international community improve the welfare of the world ’ s poorest women ?
the answer , it turns out , is to help them do what they are already doing on their own .
one of the most effective ways to empower women anywhere , but especially in the developing world , is by promoting financial independence .
in many areas , that means supporting “ informal savings groups , ” networks of like-minded women who pay dues to build a shared pool of resources .
this money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items , such as small business expenses , school fees , or health-care costs .
community-based savings groups – there are millions in asia and africa alone – are changing lives every day .
i once met a woman in burkina faso whose son owes his life to the financial resources of a savings network .
one evening , when the boy was violently ill with diarrhea , his mother called a taxi to take him to the nearest clinic .
but taxis , like ambulances , must be paid for in advance , and the woman had no money .
fortunately , a neighbor who belonged to a health savings group was able to contribute and pay the fare .
that immediate access to cash very likely saved the boy ’ s life .
most savings group loans are similarly small .
in benin , for example , the average loan size in one group is just $ 9 .
but , in a country where the average annual income is less than $ 800 , small amounts can make a huge difference .
unfortunately , many savings groups , as important as they are , do not scale ; most operate in isolation from official services , which weakens their effectiveness .
women in poor communities must rely on one another , but they also need access to government and international agencies if they are ever to escape from hunger and poverty .
that is why my organization , the grameen foundation , is using digital technology and mobile phones to connect savings groups with other service providers .
one of our largest projects is in burkina faso , a desperately poor country in west africa where an estimated 55 % of the population is food insecure for at least a portion of the year .
since 1993 , we have worked with more than 73,000 women in nearly 3,300 savings groups , bringing services directly to the women who need them .
our average participant is 40 years old , illiterate , and earns just $ 7 a week selling crops like sesame and peanut .
when we began the program , only about half of the women we worked with said they felt empowered in their homes ; many feared their husbands .
today , those sentiments are slowly changing .
by serving as a bridge between informal savings groups and banks , health centers , schools , and agricultural extension services , we are helping women make better decisions about food use , nutritional practices , and spending .
our goal is to reduce poverty rates by strengthening asset-management skills , which would give women a greater voice in their communities .
during each of my field visits , i have been amazed at how these efforts are affecting women ’ s lives .
on one recent trip , i met rasmata , a young mother who told me that thanks to the safety net of her savings group , she was managing to support her family despite her husband ’ s emigration abroad , her father ’ s recent death , and a lingering drought .
she was diversifying her income , managing her finances , and even adopting climate-smart farming techniques .
the best part was that she described herself as a “ hard-working , respectful , rigorous , and ambitious woman . ”
those are adjectives that women everywhere , regardless of their financial situation or education , deserve to ascribe to themselves .
so this week , as the world celebrates the incredible progress that women have made on the long march to parity , i will be thinking about women like rasmata , who have accomplished so much despite having so little .

istanbul – over the next few months , the 12,000 employees based at apple ’ s headquarters in cupertino , california will complete their move to an extravagant new campus .
the “ spaceship , ” covering 2.8 million square feet , includes a two-@@ story yoga studio , running paths , and even revolutionary pizza boxes that keep slices crisp .
one thing it does not have , however , is daycare .
when it comes to ignoring the importance of childcare for working parents , apple is far from unique .
and that omission places a powerful drag on parents ’ ability to achieve their economic potential , with women suffering the most .
worldwide , women carry out twice as much unpaid domestic and care work – including raising children , caring for sick or elderly family members , and managing the household – as men do .
in mexico , india , and turkey , women do three times more care work than men .
this “ gender chore gap ” limits women ’ s choices , as it impedes their ability to obtain formal education , secure good jobs , and achieve equal pay .
indeed , though women around the world actually work more than men in total ( including both paid and unpaid work ) , they earn one quarter less , on average , hold only one quarter of executive positions in the private sector , and occupy less than one quarter of all seats in national parliaments .
only half of working-age women worldwide are in the paid labor force , compared to more than three quarters of men .
this situation is slowly beginning to change .
unpaid household and care work is gradually shedding its reputation as “ women ’ s work , ” and men today are assuming more household responsibilities than their fathers and grandfathers did .
some countries , particularly in europe , are revising traditional leave policies so that parents can choose how to allocate time off after the birth of a child .
more broadly , the value of unpaid household and care work – not just for children and family members , but also for the long-term health of societies and economies – is increasingly being recognized .
efforts to measure the contribution of care work to national economies have produced estimates ranging from 20 % to 60 % of gdp .
in 2015 , united nations member states adopted the sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) , which call for recognizing , reducing , and redistributing unpaid care work – a measure long proposed by feminist economists and gender-equality advocates .
the question now is what can actually be done to meet this objective .
the responsibility will lie , first and foremost , with governments .
after all , while businesses or neighborhood associations may offer childcare options to working parents , costs and quality vary widely .
government action is needed to ensure that care services cover all who need them – from preschool children to the sick , the disabled , and the elderly – and that they are universally accessible and affordable .
beyond services , however , achieving the sdgs ’ targets will require policy change .
most important , governments must establish requirements for parental and family leave programs .
together with private companies , they can also provide monetary incentives for men and women to share household and care work more equally .
such policies have proved effective not only in northern europe – the most commonly cited model – but also in eastern european countries like lithuania , estonia , and even hungary , demonstrating that they can be applied anywhere .
at a time when many governments , particularly in the developing world , are faced with severe fiscal constraints , such interventions may seem farfetched .
but spending on the care sector should be viewed as an investment , not a cost .
a recent study in turkey showed that one dollar of public money invested in the care sector could create 2.5 times as many jobs as a dollar invested in the construction industry .
more than half of those jobs – decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards , particularly for poor households – would go to women .
international institutions can play an important role in helping governments to seize the opportunities presented by investment in the care sector .
in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , the united nations development programme undertook an initiative that helped women who had mostly worked at home their entire lives to find jobs in the care sector , enabling them to make use of their skills , by caring for children and for young adults with disabilities , while earning an income .
as populations grow and age , the care sector will only increase in importance .
adapting to these new circumstances now will give countries a considerable advantage , as it bolsters women ’ s rights and freedoms , generates jobs , and make societies more equal .
so what are we waiting for ?

worker protests in china : plentiful but preempted
the last annualized figure for labor protests that beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999 .
but a 2001 internal report from the ministry of public security disclosed that the numbers &quot; began a rise like a violent wind &quot; from 1997 , the year of the communist party &apos;s fifteenth congress , which pressed for factory firings in the name of &quot; efficiency . &quot;
while the government is determined to keep news of all disturbances out of the media-@@ -or at least downplay their size and disrup@@ tiven@@ ess--@@ it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004 , some from news sources in hong kong , some from the western media , and a few from chinese publications .
what is sparking so much unrest in a country usually depicted as daily growing more affluent ? generally the causes are these : unpaid wages and pensions ; sudden and massive job terminations ; and management corruption held responsible for the bankruptcy of industrial enterprises--@@ where discharged workers were secure , enjoying privileges and benefits , since the 1950s .
job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban populace indigent . often without a dependable channel for airing their grievances , hordes of laid-off workers and retired folk have filled the avenues over the past decade or so .
doesn &apos;t the government mind if so much of its urban populace is sinking into poverty and becoming disaffected ? why is this stability-obsessed regime allowing so much instability ?
but there is also a compensatory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureaucracies for labor and social security , and for civil affairs .
for 2004 , the central government allocated some 78 billion yuan for laid-off workers and the poor , with localities also upping their outlays . but the sad truth is that probably only about a quarter of those pushed out of their plants ever received assistance .
for those who have , however , this policy has nipped discontent in the bud .
additionally , there have been attempts to create new posts , develop labor-intensive industries and small and medium sized firms , promote the private sector , and encourage service jobs , plus offering occupational training : the government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan expressly for job creation in 2004 .
other initiatives are a program of allowances , training and placement for the laid-off ; unemployment insurance ( which , unfortunately , depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached ) ; and pension reform--@@ having similar problems .
recipients numbered over 20 million as of early 2004 , when 15 billion yuan was budgeted for the program ( with the central government contributing a full 60 % ) . these programs are noticed at the grassroots , with the indigent feeling grateful for them .
protest in china has spun upward dramatically in recent years , in numbers , scale , and organization . but by the means listed above the regime has become adept at suppressing opposition .
but overall , increasing respon@@ siven@@ ess--@@ if clearly not in a democratic mode@@ --has managed to maintain the instability that does exist at a level and within a scope that marks a game of unwritten rules -- one of complainants confining their chol@@ er within understood bounds and of the government watchful over an ever-@@ simmering stew .

cambridge -- will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a wren@@ ch into the wheels of globalization ?
or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness ?
one way or the other , unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond .
unions ’ rising influence is evident in many recent events : german chancellor angela merkel ’ s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees ; several american presidential candidates ’ open misgivings about trade and immigration ; and the chinese leadership ’ s nascent concerns about labor standards .
along with their political clout , unions ’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance .
after decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth , the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as paul krugman , who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization ’ s worst excesses .
the sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the united states , where private-sector union membership has fallen from 25 % in 1975 to 8 % today .
from high-tech google to mass retailer wal-mart , us companies have found ways to keep their shops union-@@ free .
only the public sector , where the membership rate is 35 % , has remained a union bastion .
one of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the us that he eventually moved his family to stri@@ ke-@@ happy canada .
today , us political leaders such as congressman barney frank want to bring back unions .
but there is good reason to be skeptical .
for a relatively poor country like china , real unions could help balance employers ’ power , bringing quality-of-life benefits that outweigh the growth costs .
factory conditions in parts of china are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth-century , pre-@@ union us .
thousands of chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety precautions .
but , for the us and rich countries in europe , the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious .
nowadays , most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago .
instead , union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill .
it is no surprise that the public sector , where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft , typically has the greatest union concentration .
teachers ’ unions , especially , are a catastrophe , blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries ’ education systems .
before the modern globalization era , unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale , giving them enormous bargaining power vis-à-vis both employers and consumers .
now , after the explosive post-war expansion of global trade , most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded , if not shattered .
that is why unions throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free-trade negotiations that might erode their position further .
some of the issues that unions are promoting , such as human rights and environmental quality , are unassailable .
when they try to connect these issues with trade , however , their motives become questionable .
a case in point is union lobbying against the us-colombia free-trade agreement , ratification of which would greatly advance us-latin american relations .
legitimate questions about how the colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug-@@ financed rebels do not trump broader issues .
so anti-@@ pact activists have complained that colombia is anti-union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence .
yet the colombian government notes that all colombians suffer from rebel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population .
unfortunately , this play is being re-@@ enacted across a host of trade issues , including many involving china .
for rich countries , income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system , rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions .
the rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries , that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax , with a very high exemption level so that lower-income families pay nothing .
for middle-income countries , it is a tougher call .
but here , too , increasing workers ’ legal and statutory rights , while allowing most unions to fade away , seems like the right approach .
unfortunately , we are far more likely to see unions ’ growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth , with highly uncertain consequences .
when we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead .
that is why unions will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008 .

the unfinished business of gender parity
davos – when it comes to the importance of gender equality in the workplace , the message has clearly gotten through to those at the top .
surveys – including those conducted by my own organization – consistently show that business leaders understand the need for equal treatment of men and women in the workforce .
indeed , my own conversations with senior businesspeople around the world confirm that progress clearly is being made .
the vast majority recognize the issue as imperative to their companies ’ success and have implemented measures to promote gender parity in their organizations .
and yet , for all the fine words , much more remains to be done before gender parity is actually achieved .
the facts speak for themselves .
there is still a pay gap in every country in the world , with men earning more than women for similar jobs .
likewise , the percentage of seats on corporate boards occupied by women appears to have stalled at just over 17 % .
this bias has not gone unnoticed – especially among female employees .
in a 2015 pwc global survey of female millennials born between 1980 and 1995 , half of those working in financial services said they believed that men received more favorable treatment when it came to promotions .
more than 70 % said that as much as their organizations talk about diversity , in reality , opportunities remain unequal .
interestingly , other studies conclude that when women are provided with the opportunity to perform on an equal footing with men , they more often than not come out on top .
a recent ten-year analysis of 300 start-up investments backed by venture capitalists in the united states showed that companies with a female founder performed 63 % better than those with all-male founding teams .
and another of pwc ’ s research programs , examining the changing faces of billionaires worldwide , discovered what we called the “ athena factor . ”
the increase in the number of female billionaires significantly outpaces that among men , with asia registering the fastest growth in the ranks of self-made female billionaires .
where women have the opportunity to capitalize on their talents , they are doing so successfully and with gusto .
meanwhile , there is growing recognition of the positive contribution that greater workforce diversity makes to business performance .
and yet , as reflected in the stubborn persistence of the pay gap , barriers to women ’ s progress remain .
what is now needed is a genuine and permanent shift in attitudes and behavior .
many of the biases holding women back are unconscious ; and , by their very nature , these blind spots cannot be tackled by statements of intent alone .
tackling gender inequality will require us to identify where , how , and why these biases materialize , and to develop systematic strategies and interventions to root them out .
in order to accomplish this , businesses must actively challenge men to help advance women in the workforce .
that is why i am proud to be a founding corporate impact champion of the un women ’ s heforshe movement .
creating real and lasting change will require helping men and women work together .
not only do women make up half the global population ; the same skills needed to work through differences in gender – open-mindedness , humility , empathy – can be used to work across other types of differences , be they cultural , physical , or personal .
it is important , of course , to reassure male skeptics who view gender parity as a threat .
in june 2015 , i hosted a heforshe chat on twitter , and while the conversation was overwhelmingly positive , an obvious concern surfaced : why should men help promote women to positions for which they themselves are aiming ?
addressing such concerns will require us to show that we are not promoting some people at the expense of others ; gender parity must be win-win , not zero-sum .
at pwc , this is being addressed by hosting conversations in which men and women discuss gender issues collaboratively and respectfully , and by working with both genders to challenge double standards and acknowledge potential blind spots .
recent research suggests that , at the current rate of progress , it will take another 80 years to reach gender parity .
that is not good enough .
let us all commit to achieving it in our lifetimes – for the benefit of everyone .

pittsburgh – in the fight against hiv / aids , some stories illuminate the long road to global eradication more than others .
in 2009 , i heard one such story in tanzania .
i was visiting a remote village when i spoke to a woman who knew that she was hiv-positive .
she told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of cd@@ 4 t-@@ hel@@ per cells , a type of white blood cell used by the immune system , had dropped below a certain threshold .
after walking several miles to get her count checked , she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken .
the machine was still inoperative the second time she made the long journey .
only months later , after her third trip to the clinic on foot , did she receive her cell count : her levels were far below the necessary threshold .
her treatment should have begun months before .
since hiv / aids was first identified in 1984 , it has killed more than 35 million people .
although the number of aids-related deaths has fallen by almost half since peaking in 2005 , there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition .
in 2016 alone , one million people around the world died from hiv-@@ related causes , while 1.8 million more became infected . contrary to popular myth , we have not turned the corner on aids – not by a long shot .
world aids day , on december 1 , is an occasion to honor the millions of victims , and to recommit to ending this devastating disease .
according to unaids , just 54 % of hiv-positive adults , and only 43 % of hiv-positive children , are currently receiving the antiretroviral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections .
with so many untreated patients , the virus will continue to spread .
as ceo of a global pharmaceutical company , i ’ m proud of the work we have done to fight hiv / aids around the world .
today , more than eight million people – nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for hiv in developing countries – depend on the antiretroviral treatments that we produce .
but for those of us on the front lines of this struggle , our work is far from over .
the pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment , and to help stop the spread of hiv once and for all .
fulfilling four key commitments will make this goal achievable .
for starters , pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low-cost , generic medicines .
my company , mylan , introduced the first generic once-@@ daily pill for developing countries in 2009 , and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people .
with this treatment alone , mylan and other generic manufacturers save the us government , international donors , and national health programs more than $ 4.5 billion a year .
still , treatment options could be expanded further .
in september , mylan announced a collaboration with unaids , the bill &amp; melinda gates foundation , the clinton health access initiative , and other partners to provide the next-generation single-@@ pill hiv regimen to patients in more than 90 low- and middle-income countries for less than $ 75 per year .
these drugs are widely used in high-income countries because they produce fewer side effects .
next , drug makers must continue investing in capacity and supply-chain reliability .
since 2005 , the number of people on antiretroviral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten , to 21 million .
but roughly twice as many people are currently infected with hiv .
over the last decade , mylan has invested more than $ 250 million in expanding production capacity , and we now produce four billion tablets and capsules each year .
but further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment .
a third urgently needed commitment is to increase support for research that accelerates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery .
for example , mylan provides study medications to research trials , like the max@@ art trial in swaziland , which demonstrated that providing treatment to all hiv-positive people is the best way to slow the disease ’ s spread .
we also supported the kirby institute ’ s encore@@ 1 trial , to develop a reduced-@@ dose version of the most commonly used hiv treatment regimen .
and we are currently working with the us agency for international development as part of a partnership called optimize , which aims to accelerate access to new therapies .
we do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any marketable intellectual property – we won ’ t .
rather , we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment .
finally , real gains in the fight against hiv / aids will require drug makers to account for the limitations of health-care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve .
antiretroviral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges .
but developing countries often have limited cold-storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk .
that ’ s why mylan has developed heat-stable , tast@@ e-@@ masked , disper@@ sible tablets that can easily be incorporated into food .
our scientists are now working on the next-generation formula , which comes in the equivalent of a sugar pac@@ ket that even newborns can take .
more innovations like these will be needed to solve the country-specific issues that patients face .
the global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on hiv / aids , introducing new products and advocating for earlier treatment .
but when i think back to the woman i met in tanzania , i am reminded of how much work remains to be done .
makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight , and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it .

the risk of a new economic non-order
london – next month , when finance ministers and central bank governors from more than 180 countries gather in washington , dc , for the annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank , they will confront a global economic order under increasing strain .
having failed to deliver the inclusive economic prosperity of which it is capable , that order is subject to growing doubts – and mounting challenges .
barring a course correction , the risks that today ’ s order will yield to a world economic non-order will only intensify .
the current international economic order , spearheaded by the united states and its allies in the wake of world war ii , is underpinned by multilateral institutions , including the imf and the world bank .
these institutions were designed to crystallize member countries ’ obligations , and they embodied a set of best economic-policy practices that evolved into what became known as the “ washington consensus . ”
that consensus was rooted in an economic paradigm that aimed to promote win-win interactions among countries , emphasizing trade liberalization , relatively unrestricted cross-border capital flows , free-market pricing , and domestic deregulation .
all of this stood in stark contrast to what developed behind the iron curtain and in china over the first half of the postwar period .
for several decades , the western-led international order functioned well , helping to deliver prosperity and relative financial stability .
then it was shaken by a series of financial shocks that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis , which triggered cascading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi-year depression .
it was the most severe economic breakdown since the great depression of the 1930s .
but the crisis did not appear out of nowhere to challenge a healthy economic order .
on the contrary , the evolution of the global order had long been outpaced by structural economic changes on the ground , with multilateral governance institutions taking too long to recognize fully the significance of financial-sector developments and their impact on the real economy , or to make adequate room for emerging economies .
for example , governance structures , including voting power , correspond better to the economic realities of yesterday than to those of today and tomorrow .
and nationality , rather than merit , still is the dominant guide for the appointment of these institutions ’ leaders , with top positions still reserved for european and us citizens .
the destabilizing consequences of this obstinate failure to reform sufficiently multilateral governance have been compounded by china ’ s own struggle to reconcile its domestic priorities with its global economic responsibilities as the world ’ s second-largest economy .
several other countries , particularly among the advanced economies , have also failed to transform their domestic policies to account for changes to economic relationships resulting from globalization , liberalization , and deregulation .
as a result of all of this , the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage , not just economically , but also politically and socially .
with too many people feeling marginalized , forgotten , and dispossessed – and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen – domestic policy pressure has intensified , causing countries to turn inward .
this tendency is reflected in recent challenges to several features of the economic order , such as the north american free-trade agreement , as well as america ’ s withdrawal from the trans-pacific partnership and the united kingdom ’ s renunciation of european union membership .
all are casting a shadow on the future of the global economic system .
america ’ s inward turn , already underway for several years , has been particularly consequential , because it leaves the world order without a main conductor .
with no other country or group of countries anywhere close to being in a position to carry the baton , the emergence of what the political scientist ian bremmer has called a “ g-zero era ” becomes a lot more probable .
china is responding to the global system ’ s weakening core by accelerating its efforts to build small networks , including around the traditional western-dominated power structures .
this has included the establishment of the asian infrastructure investment bank , the proliferation of bilateral payments agreements , and the pursuit of the “ belt and road initiative ” to build infrastructure linking china with western asia , europe , and africa .
these dynamics are stoking trade tensions and raising the risk of economic fragmentation .
if this trend continues , the global economic and financial configuration will become increasingly unstable , amplifying geopolitical and security threats at a time when better cross-border coordination is vital to address threats from non-state actors and disruptive regimes , such as north korea .
over time , the risks associated with this shift toward a global economic non-order could have severe adverse effects on geopolitics and national security .
none of this is new .
yet , year after year , top government officials at the imf / world bank annual meetings fail to address it .
this year is likely to be no different .
instead of discussing concrete steps to slow and reverse the march toward a global economic non-order , officials will probably welcome the cyclical uptick in global growth and urge member countries to do more to remove structural impediments to faster , more durable , and more inclusive growth .
while understandable , that isn ’ t good enough .
the upcoming meetings offer a critical opportunity to start a serious discussion of how to arrest the lose-lose dynamics that have been gaining traction in the global economy .
the longer it takes for the seeds of reform to be sown , the less likely they will be to take root – and the higher the probability that a lose-lose world economic non-order will emerge .

poverty beyond the numbers
asunción – what is poverty ?
for decades , we have defined it with a number , which the world bank currently puts at a personal income of less than $ 1.90 per day .
but a single number fails to capture the complexity of poverty .
measuring more than just income is essential to understanding the needs of poor people and delivering optimal assistance .
as the world bank convenes its spring meetings in washington , dc next week , we have an opportunity to set benchmarks that include social and environmental dimensions of poverty .
the bank has acknowledged that more than income should be considered , and recently established a commission on global poverty to recommend additional metrics .
although many public and private groups already collect data on a range of issues affecting poor communities such as nutrition , maternal health , or access to education , such information remains largely untapped and is rarely shared across institutions .
but there are some beacons of light , including the social progress index , which provides a framework for tracking multiple symptoms of poverty across countries and complements traditional income-based measures .
when we rely on a single number to measure poverty , we misdiagnose the needs of poor people .
in my home country , paraguay , i work with one of the country ’ s largest social enterprises , fundación paraguaya , to provide microfinance , education , and training to thousands of our poorest citizens .
we look at 50 metrics across six dimensions of poverty , including income , housing , education , and infrastructure .
one of our clients , doña mercedes , is now a successful micro-@@ entrepreneur from a rural community not far from the capital city of asunción .
when she first started with fundación paraguaya , she was sharing a single-@@ bedroom home with 16 other family members and cooking meals on a small fire pit on the dirt floor .
now she has a cement floor , a brick house , a separate kitchen , and around $ 500 in personal savings .
while traditional approaches focus largely on estimating the sources of household expenses and income , the fundación paraguaya self-@@ evaluation helped doña mercedes break down her needs into 50 discrete areas that she could work on , piece by piece , and monitor over time .
for example , she self-@@ evaluated the state of her bathroom and kitchen , the quality of the food eaten at home , the family ’ s dental health , the number of separate bedrooms in the house , and even her self-esteem and decision-making capacity .
next she plans to add two more bedrooms to her house and to work on enlarging her business .
fundación paraguaya has been able to replicate this type of success in other parts of the world .
in tanzania , where i worked for three years in rural communities , we helped villages in the southern highlands adapt our poverty indicators to the local context in order to tackle water , sanitation , and electrification needs .
similar efforts are being deployed in south africa , nigeria , uganda , china , and beyond .
we could make even more progress with public-sector support .
fundación paraguaya collects rich data across multiple dimensions , tracking more than 8,700 families each year in paraguay alone .
if this information were to reach the government of paraguay – which has its own methods for collecting data – we could identify pockets of poverty sooner and customize programs to help each family .
because the information is self-reported , this sort of collaboration could deliver targeted aid and highlight specific public services that are needed .
moreover , if the world bank ’ s commission on global poverty adopts multidimensional poverty measures , it will spur other organizations to produce and share more detailed poverty data .
that will give aid workers a more comprehensive poverty map of the world , helping to boost the effectiveness of anti-poverty efforts everywhere .
it won ’ t be easy to choose which measures to include , or even how to set universal yardsticks ; but even adopting a few basic ones would spur progress .
for too long , one-dimensional measures such as the $ 1.90 per day guideline have misdiagnosed poor people ’ s problems – and more importantly , their causes .
we know that the $ 1.90 per day benchmark does not fully capture the struggles of poor people in places such as paraguay .
fortunately , the world bank now appears to recognize the limits of its income-based indicator .
ensuring that the right type of aid reaches those most in need in a timely and effective manner requires development policymakers to embrace the type of multidimensional poverty data that aid organizations like fundación paraguaya have learned to gather .

the sky is not falling
vienna – humans are partial to bad news .
media outlets reflect and shape this preference , feeding us woe and panic .
long , slow , positive trends don ’ t make it to the front page or to water-@@ cooler conversations .
so we develop peculiar misperceptions , especially the idea that a preponderance of things are going wrong .
when i published the skeptical environmentalist in 2001 , i pointed out that the world was getting better in many respects .
back then , this was viewed as heresy , as it punctured several common and cherished misperceptions , such as the idea that natural resources were running out , that an ever-growing population was leaving less to eat , and that air and water were becoming ever-more polluted .
in each case , careful examination of the data established that the gloomy scenarios prevailing at the time were exaggerated .
while fish stocks , for example , are depleted because of a lack of regulation , we can actually eat more fish than ever , thanks to the advent of aquaculture .
worries that we are losing forests overlook the reality that as countries become richer , they increase their forest cover .
since i wrote the book , the world has only become better , according to many important indicators .
we have continued to see meaningful reductions in infant mortality and malnutrition , and there have been massive strides toward eradication of polio , measles , malaria , and illiteracy .
by focusing on the most lethal environmental problem – air pollution – we can see some of the reasons for improvement .
as the world developed , deaths from air pollution have declined dramatically , and that trend is likely to continue .
looking at a polluted city in a country like china might suggest otherwise , but the air inside the homes of most poor people is about ten times more polluted than the worst outdoor air in beijing .
the most serious environmental problem for humans is indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with dirty fuels like wood and dung – which is the result of poverty .
in 1900 , more than 90 % of all air pollution deaths resulted from indoor air pollution .
economic development has meant more outdoor pollution , but also much less indoor pollution .
reductions in poverty have gone hand in hand with a four-fold reduction in global air pollution mortality .
yet more people today still die from indoor air pollution than from outdoor pollution .
even in china , while outside air has become a lot more polluted , poverty reduction has caused a lower risk of total air pollution death .
and as countries become richer , they can afford to regulate and cut even outdoor air pollution .
two hundred years ago , almost every person on the planet lived in poverty , and a tiny elite in luxury .
today just 9.1 % of the population , or almost 700 million people , lives on less than $ 1.90 per day ( or what used to be one dollar in 1985 ) .
and just in the last 20 years , the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved .
yet few of us know this .
the gapminder foundation surveyed the uk and found that just 10 % of people believe poverty has decreased .
in south africa and in sweden , more people believe extreme poverty has doubled than believe – correctly – that it has plummeted .
how do we continue our swift progress ?
there has been no shortage of well-intentioned policy interventions , so we have decades of data showing what works well and what doesn ’ t .
in the latter category , even well-considered ideas from the world ’ s most eminent thinkers can fall short .
the ambitious millennium villages concept was supposed to create simultaneous progress on multiple fronts , producing “ major results in three or fewer years , ” according to founder jeffrey d. sachs .
but a study by the united kingdom ’ s department for international development shows the villages had “ moderately positive impacts , ” and “ little overall impact on poverty . ”
it ’ s more constructive to focus on what works .
global analysis of development targets for copenhagen consensus by a panel of nobel laureate economists showed where more money can achieve the most .
they concluded that improved access to contraception and family-planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality , and also – through a demographic dividend – increase economic growth .
likewise , research assessing the best development policies for haiti found that focusing on improvements in nutrition through the use of fortified flour would transform the health of young children , creating lifelong benefits .
other copenhagen consensus research suggests that scaling up government e-procurement platforms would be transformative .
this may sound tangential to poverty reduction , but it ’ s not .
on average , developing countries use half their budgets on procurement ; enabling transparent competition could reduce losses caused by corruption .
this is not mere speculation .
a case study in bangladesh , which spends more than $ 9 billion on public procurement annually , found that piloting e-procurement in just one government department lowered prices by 12 % , leaving more resources for other important budget priorities .
the research shows that expanding digital procurement government-wide would save $ 670 million annually – enough to increase annual public-health spending by about 50 % .
the bangladeshi government is now fast-tracking this expansion .
and the most powerful weapon in the fight against poverty is the one that got us where we are today : broad-based economic growth .
over the past 30 years , china ’ s growth spurt alone lifted an unprecedented 680 million people above the poverty line .
a global trade agreement – such as a successful conclusion to the stalled doha round – would lift another 160 million people out of poverty .
skepticism toward free trade hurts the world ’ s poorest .
while other us policies and tweets by president donald trump get far more coverage , the current administration ’ s rejection of free trade could be the biggest tragedy .
humanity ’ s success in reducing poverty is an extraordinary achievement , and one that we are far too reticent about acknowledging .
we need to make sure that we don ’ t lose sight of what got us this far – and what justifies the hope of an even better future .

why the world cup mattered
paris – the seventeenth-century philosopher and satirist jean de la bruyère once quipped that , “ corneille portrays men as they should be , racine depicts them as they are . ” for europeans , and even more so for the french , the 2018 world cup was a cornei@@ llian event .
the month-long soccer tournament in russia offered an enchanted respite from a tumultuous world and revealed the better angels of our nature .
in the counter-@@ reality of the tournament , a mood of self-confidence , altruism , and openness to the “ other ” prevailed .
at least for a while , the chauvinism , alienation , and despair that have dominated this era of populist nationalism seemed to be forgotten .
geographically speaking , all four of the semifinalists – france , croatia , belgium , and england – hailed from the old continent .
denounce europe for its supposed weakness and decadence all you want . when it comes to the world ’ s most popular sport , europe is king .
moreover , it is clear that africa is the soccer continent of the future , whereas latin america is the continent of the past .
having won the cup in 1930 and again in 1950 , uruguay was once the smallest country ( by population ) to reach the final .
but that honor is now shared by the brave team fielded by croatia , the newest eu member state .
in stark contrast to the “ real world , ” the two leading powers , the united states and china , played no role in the tournament .
former us secretary of state henry kissinger ’ s dream of turning the us into a great soccer power has proved to be more difficult than he had hoped .
and china under president xi jinping remains a soccer lightweight , despite having invested billions of dollars in the sport .
instead , north america was represented with brio by mexico , and asia by japan and south korea .
the strange divergence between the real world and the world of soccer this year was also evident in expressions of nationalist emotion .
the great argentinian writer jorge luis borges once condemned the sport for its role in fueling toxic forms of nationalism ( such as the short-lived “ football war ” between honduras and el salvador in 1969 ) .
but in the 2018 world cup – a century after the end of the nationalist bloodbath that was world war i – a “ soft , ” even gentle nationalism prevailed .
russia is hardly an exponent of soft power , yet it deserves credit for the absence of violence during the tournament .
international press reports showed ukrainian and russian fans fraterni@@ zing like old friends .
whereas the vietnam war-era woodstock festival exemplified the slogan “ make love , not war , ” the de facto slogan of the 2018 cup seems to have been “ balls , not bombs . ”
in addition to channeling a more constructive form of nationalism , the semifinalists and their fans also embodied effective collective action , altruism , openness , and tolerance .
interestingly , the teams that relied on a single star player – whether cristiano ronaldo of portugal , lionel messi of argentina , or neymar of brazil – all failed to advance beyond the quarterfinals .
in the real world nowadays , people are increasingly tempted to erect walls and close themselves off from “ others . ”
and yet , the strength of the winning team , france , was in its diversity .
this year ’ s chant of “ liberté , egalité , mbappé ” ( for the 19-year-old french forward kylian mbappé ) was a more enlightened version of the slogan from france ’ s victory in 1998 : “ zidane for president . ”
although there have been limited strikes against french president emmanuel macron ’ s reform agenda , these commentators got it wrong .
the closest parallel to this year is not 1968 or 1995 , but 1998 , when france first won the world cup .
domestically , france ’ s victory likely will have little effect , if any , on macron ’ s popularity .
no one can deny that “ france is back , ” at least in terms of soccer .
the country has emerged as an oasis of dynamism , realism , and youthful enthusiasm , much of which is also reflected in macron himself .
an obvious foil is germany .
usually a soccer powerhouse , the german team was eliminated in the first round of this year ’ s tournament , just as its politics were entering a deeper malaise .
in geopolitical terms , if one were to name just two winners this year , the titles would have to go to russia and france .

world cup heralds a new korea
the euphoria of fans whose team wins a major sporting event is ephemeral .
but , prominent professors at korean universities tell me that the unprecedented success of the korean team in the current world cup competition is causing a turning point in korean attitudes towards their own society and economy .
why ?
many koreans , especially those who studied or lived in the west , complain about the &quot; cronyism &quot; , and the resulting importance of &quot; connections &quot; in all walks of korean life , which they see as pervasive features of korean society .
they claim that such rampant cronyism is preventing korea from catching up economically with the west , despite the fact that korea soon will have as much human capital as western countries .
to understand korean cronyism we have to see it as one aspect of a set of related social conventions .
koreans accept a sense of knowing one &apos;s place in society that seems extreme to americans .
in social interactions , and also in business dealings , koreans maintain a hierarchy that seems to weigh age more highly than performance .
also , although admission to elite universities is as meritocratic in korea as in the west , the outcome of the university entrance competition has a more important and more permanent effect on one &apos;s place in korean society .
it is only a slight exaggeration to say that in america people have to prove themselves continually , whereas in traditional korean society people have only to prove themselves once , then they can be set for life due in large measure to the network of crony contacts that initial success will have provided .
what do korean cronyism and related social conventions have to do with the world cup ?
in the past cronyism apparently has been as pervasive in the selection of korean teams for international sports competitions as in other areas of korean society .
but , two years ago when the korean soccer football association hired the dutchman , guus hiddink , to coach the korean national soccer team , hiddink made it clear that he would select his players based on merit alone .
the performance of the korean team in the 2002 world cup competition is demonstrating to every korean in a way that is easily seen that meritocracy yields better results than cronyism .
it also helps that hiddink has been able to use his coaching skills to bring out in his team the strengths of the korean national character : intelligence , discipline , tenacity , and perseverance .
of course , korean traditionalists reject criticism of what westernized koreans call cronyism .
traditionalists argue that criticism of cronyism is really criticism of social solidarity and responsibility , which they see as positive features of korean society .
traditionalists also argue that meritocracy implies individualism , and that too much individualism and too little social solidarity and responsibility are negative features of western society .
some traditionalists even might claim that they do not want koreans to be as rich as westerners if that requires koreans to be as individualistic as westerners .
the hiddink phenomenon did not emerge suddenly out of thin air .
the accumulation of gradual changes that have already occurred in korean society made it acceptable to import a westerner to coach the korean national soccer team and to allow him to establish a meritocratic regime .
but hiddink has expedited the process of change within korean society , and his success has made it look revolutionary .
it remains to be seen how fast , in what ways , and with what effects , korean society will continue to change .
koreans are talking about learning the lessons of hiddink . but the western model of a meritocratic society is not easy to emulate .
a soccer team is a relatively simple organization .
implementing the lessons of hiddink throughout korean society will present more difficult challenges .
whatever the outcome , it seems that in the case of the 2002 world cup the effects of success in a major sporting event will not be ephemeral .

the world economy in 2018
stanford – all major macroeconomic indicators – growth , unemployment , and inflation – suggest that 2017 will be the american economy ’ s best year in a decade .
and the global economy is enjoying broad , synchronized growth beyond what anyone expected .
the question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 2018 .
the answer , of course , will depend on monetary , fiscal , trade , and related policies in the united states and around the world .
and yet it is hard to predict what policy proposals will emerge in 2018 .
there are relatively new heads of state in the us , france , and the united kingdom ; german leaders still have not formed a governing coalition since the general election in september ; and the us federal reserve has a new chair awaiting confirmation .
moreover , major changes in important developing economies such as argentina , saudi arabia , and brazil have made the future outlook even murkier .
still , we should hope for the best .
first and foremost , we should hope that synchronized global growth at a rate of just under 4 % will continue in 2018 , as the international monetary fund projected in october .
growth not only raises incomes , but also makes vexing problems such as bad bank loans and budget deficits more manageable .
as former us president john f. kennedy famously said in an october 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions , “ a rising tide lifts all boats . ”
for my part , i predict that the global recovery will continue , but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5 % .
the two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be europe , where a cyclical upturn could stall , and the oil-rich middle east , where tensions could flare up once again .
second , let us hope that the fed , guided by the steady hand of its new chair , jerome “ jay ” powell , will continue or even accelerate its monetary-policy normalization , both by raising its benchmark federal funds rate , and by shrinking its eng@@ or@@ ged balance sheet .
and we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks , especially the european central bank , to follow suit .
on this front , i predict that the major central banks will continue to normalize monetary policies more gradually than is necessary .
the biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the fed under its new leadership , for example , if inflation rises faster than anticipated .
third , let us hope that the republican tax package will , if enacted , deliver on its promise of increased investment , output , productivity , and wages over the coming decade .
here , i predict that the legislation will pass , and that investment in the us over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken .
to be sure , whether investment will rise from its currently subdued level will depend on many other factors than the corporate-tax rate .
but the tax package can still be expected to boost output , productivity , and wages .
the question is not if , but when .
if the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 2018 or 2020 elections , that lag could prove politically consequential .
the biggest danger is that its benefits will be delayed , and that its key provisions will be reversed whenever the democrats are back in power .
fourth , let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the looming crisis in public-pension and health-care costs , which have been rising for decades .
as social programs become costlier , they crowd out government expenditures on necessities such as defense , while generating ever more pressure to impose higher growth-@@ suppressing taxes .
europe , in particular , must not let its cyclical rebound lull it into complacency .
many european union member states still need to reduce their government debt , and the eurozone needs to resolve its “ zombie bank ” crisis .
beyond that , structural labor-market reforms of the kind french president emmanuel macron is pursuing would be most welcome .
unfortunately , i ’ m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be sporadic , at best .
the danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to defuse the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries .
another risk is that reform attempts could provoke a political backlash that would be harmful to long-term investment .
fifth , let us hope that the eurozone can avoid a currency crisis .
this will depend largely on whether german chancellor angela merkel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to europe ’ s largest economy .
sixth , we should hope that the eu and the uk can agree on a reasonable brexit deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations .
the main risk here is that localized declines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm .
and , beyond europe , let us hope that negotiations between the us , canada , and mexico over the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) will result in an arrangement that still facilitates continental trade .
for trade generally , the biggest risk is that the trump administration could start a lose-lose trade dispute , owing to its understandable eagerness to help american manufacturing workers .
seventh , let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology ( ict ) strike the right balance among all stakeholders ’ competing and legitimate concerns .
on one hand , there is reason to worry about certain internet companies ’ concentration of market power , particularly in online content and distribution , and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy , law enforcement , and national security .
on the other hand , new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains .
it is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation , or of too little .
it is also easy to envision a large-scale public backlash against the major technology companies , particularly if poor self-policing or a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement leads to some horrible event .
here , i predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years .
if some future event strikes an emotional chord , the public ’ s mood could swing dramatically .
ultimately , however , i suspect that competition and innovation will survive the forthcoming regulations .
finally , and most important , let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere , conflicts subside , democracy and capitalism regain some momentum , and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain .
should that happen in 2018 , it will be a very good year indeed .

the world economy without china
new haven – is the chinese economy about to implode ?
with its debt overhangs and property bubbles , its zombie state-owned enterprises and struggling banks , china is increasingly portrayed as the next disaster in a crisis-prone world .
i remain convinced that such fears are overblown , and that china has the strategy , wherewithal , and commitment to achieve a dramatic structural transformation into a services-based consumer society while successfully dodging daunting cyclical headwinds .
but i certainly recognize that this is now a minority opinion .
for example , us treasury secretary jacob j. lew continues to express the rather puzzling view that the united states “ can ’ t be the only engine in the world economy . ”
actually , it ’ s not : the chinese economy is on track to contribute well over four times as much to global growth as the us this year .
but maybe lew is already assuming the worst for china in his assessment of the world economy .
so what if the china doubters are right ?
what if china ’ s economy does indeed come crashing down , with its growth rate plunging into low single digits , or even negative territory , as would be the case in most crisis economies ?
china would suffer , of course , but so would an already-@@ shaky global economy .
with all the handwringing over the chinese economy , it ’ s worth considering this thought experiment in detail .
for starters , without china , the world economy would already be in recession .
china ’ s growth rate this year appears set to hit 6.7 % – considerably higher than most forecasters have been expecting .
according to the international monetary fund – the official arbiter of global economic metrics – the chinese economy accounts for 17.3 % of world gdp ( measured on a purchasing-power-parity basis ) .
a 6.7 % increase in chinese real gdp thus translates into about 1.2 percentage points of world growth .
absent china , that contribution would need to be subtracted from the imf ’ s downwardly revised 3.1 % estimate for world gdp growth in 2016 , dragging it down to 1.9 % – well below the 2.5 % threshold commonly associated with global recessions .
of course , that ’ s just the direct effect of a world without china .
then there are cross-border linkages with other major economies .
the so-called resource economies – namely , australia , new zealand , canada , russia , and brazil – would be hit especially hard .
as a resource-intensive growth juggernaut , china has transformed these economies , which collectively account for nearly 9 % of world gdp .
while all of them argue that they have diversified economic structures that are not overly dependent on chinese commodity demand , currency markets say otherwise : whenever china ’ s growth expectations are revised – upward or downward – their exchange rates move in tandem .
the imf currently projects that these five economies will contract by a combined 0.7 % in 2016 , reflecting ongoing recessions in russia and brazil and modest growth in the other three .
needless to say , in a china implosion scenario , this baseline estimate would be revised downward significantly .
the same would be the case for china ’ s asian trading partners – most of which remain export-dependent economies , with the chinese market their largest source of external demand .
that is true not only of smaller asian developing economies such as indonesia , the philippines , and thailand , but also of the larger and more developed economies in the region , such as japan , korea , and taiwan .
collectively , these six china-dependent asian economies make up another 11 % of world gdp .
a china implosion could easily knock at least one percentage point off their combined growth rate .
the united states is also a case in point .
china is america ’ s third-largest and most rapidly growing export market .
in a china-@@ implosion scenario , that export demand would all but dry up – knocking approximately 0.2-0.3 percentage points off already subpar us economic growth of around 1.6 % in 2016 .
finally , there is europe to consider .
growth in germany , long the engine of an otherwise sclerotic continental economy , remains heavily dependent on exports .
that is due increasingly to the importance of china – now germany ’ s third-largest export market , after the european union and the united states .
in a china implosion scenario , german economic growth could also be significantly lower , dragging down the rest of a german-led europe .
interestingly , in its just-released october update of the world economic outlook , the imf devotes an entire chapter to what it calls a china spillover analysis – a model-based assessment of the global impacts of a china slowdown .
consistent with the arguments above , the imf focuses on linkages to commodity exporters , asian exporters , and what they call “ systemic advanced economies ” ( germany , japan , and the us ) that would be most exposed to a chinese downturn .
by their reckoning , the impact on asia would be the largest , followed closely by the resource economies ; the sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about half that of china ’ s non-@@ japan asian trading partners .
the imf research suggests that china ’ s global spillovers would add about another 25 % to the direct effects of china ’ s growth shortfall .
that means that if chinese economic growth vanished into thin air , in accordance with our thought experiment , the sum of the direct effects ( 1.2 percentage points of global growth ) and indirect spillovers ( roughly another 0.3 percentage points ) would essentially halve the current baseline estimate of 2016 global growth , from 3.1 % to 1.6 % .
while that would be far short of the record 0.1 % global contraction in 2009 , it wouldn ’ t be much different than two earlier deep world recessions , in 1975 ( 1 % growth ) and 1982 ( 0.7 % ) .
i may be one of the only china optimists left .
while i am hardly upbeat about prospects for the global economy , i think the world faces far bigger problems than a major meltdown in china .
yet i would be the first to concede that a post-crisis world economy without chinese growth would be in grave difficulty .
china bears need to be careful what they wish for .

feeding myanmar ’ s refugees
cox ’ s bazar – the rohingya refugee camp in the bangladeshi port city of cox ’ s bazar is a sea of metal roofs as far as the eye can see , shimmering under an unrelenting sun .
mohammed , a 60-year-old resident , greets me outside his new home and thanks me in breathless ra@@ sps for our support .
he suffers from a lar@@ yn@@ x disease , one that could easily be treated with a surgery that he cannot afford .
but he is simply grateful to be alive , and far away from the torture and misery he left behind in myanmar .
like many of those fleeing myanmar , mohammed walked for five days to reach bangladesh .
sadly , his hardship is only beginning .
like the tens of thousands who huddle here for safety , he ekes out a life for his children and grandchildren on a muddy and infertile slope .
what his family eats depends on others , including the sustenance provided by my colleagues at the world food programme .
the wfp is meeting emergency food needs for nearly 700,000 rohingya , supplying nutrient-rich bisc@@ u@@ its to new arrivals and feeding registered residents with regular distributions of rice , vegetable oil , and lentils .
we are also providing hot meals through community kitchens and delivering supplemental nutrition to pregnant women , breastfeeding mothers , and young children .
the rohingya here are safe from persecution , but the threat of illness and malnutrition pursues them .
we are reminded of this every day as we comb the camp to check on families receiving wfp support .
the sight of young children playing barefoot in filthy water , or wading in streams flowing with human waste , is ubiquitous .
as the number of refugees grows daily , cases of malnutrition , especially among mothers and young children , are rising .
preliminary findings from a joint nutrition assessment show that one in four children is malnourished , and refugees are desperate when they cross the border .
malnutrition rates were already high in northern rakhine state before the rohingya fled .
regrettably , the health of the displaced has deteriorated further , owing to the hardship of their journey and the conditions in which they are now living .
to prevent malnutrition from taking hold , the international community needs more resources and more funding across many sectors .
in early october , the wfp called for an immediate $ 77 million in emergency aid . that plea still stands , and with the depth of the suffering increasing , the need for resources grows by the day .
but food assistance alone is not enough to overcome this crisis .
poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water can just as easily undermine health .
today , more than half of new arrivals tell us that their children are already suffering from diarrhea .
once the immediate pangs of hunger are addressed , refugees need help reinventing diets with diverse , locally sourced fresh foods .
to that end , wfp is seeking to expand our electronic voucher program , a cash card that allows families to choose from 19 food items on the local market , including garlic , greens , onions , and chi@@ lies .
we are also planning to roll out an e-@@ voucher program for new refugees by early 2018 .
these initiatives will empower refugees to make their own choices and shop for nutritious food on a regular basis , while supporting local businesses .
fighting malnutrition also means navigating the social realities of camp life .
it is often easier to measure malnutrition among women and children by visiting them in their shelters .
this is especially true for women without extended families , or those whose husbands may not approve of them visiting the health center alone .
walking in the muddy , dimly lit camps can also be dangerous .
but while our staff go hut to hut to help people locate food-distribution and nutrition-@@ support centers , we struggle to reach everyone .
when people started arriving in cox ’ s bazar in late august , during the muslim eid holiday , residents showed immense generosity .
our staff heard countless stories of locals sharing the special food they had prepared for the festivities with the hungry new arrivals .
locals here are no strangers to visitors .
the magical 120 kilometers of natural beach attracts thousands of holi@@ day@@ makers every year .
refugees have also been arriving for decades , fleeing previous bouts of violence in myanmar .
unfortunately , eid and any surplus food are now distant memories .
many locals are fishermen or rice farmers , and their resources are stretched from sharing their land , markets , and roads with the massive influx of refugees .
to reduce the potential for tension between refugees and their hosts , international aid efforts must target both communities .
in addition to meeting refugees ’ most fundamental needs , wfp is expanding its school feeding , nutrition , and livelihood activities to the host communities .
despite the dire circumstances , the people i have met in the camps are extraordinarily resilient .
women deftly weave bamboo poles into walls for their shelters .
and everywhere i look , men , women , and children – despite being weighed down by their daily loads , carrying food and firewood – are taking small steps to improve their lives .
the role of the wfp and the international community supporting the bangladeshi authorities is to ease the rohingya ’ s hardship today , and push for solutions that help them realize their aspirations tomorrow .

the return of currency wars
new york – the recent decision by the bank of japan to increase the scope of its quantitative easing is a signal that another round of currency wars may be under way .
the boj ’ s effort to weaken the yen is a beggar-thy-neighbor approach that is inducing policy reactions throughout asia and around the world .
central banks in china , south korea , taiwan , singapore , and thailand , fearful of losing competitiveness relative to japan , are easing their own monetary policies – or will soon ease more .
the european central bank and the central banks of switzerland , sweden , norway , and a few central european countries are likely to embrace quantitative easing or use other unconventional policies to prevent their currencies from appreciating .
all of this will lead to a strengthening of the us dollar , as growth in the united states is picking up and the federal reserve has signaled that it will begin raising interest rates next year .
but , if global growth remains weak and the dollar becomes too strong , even the fed may decide to raise interest rates later and more slowly to avoid excessive dollar appreciation .
the cause of the latest currency turmoil is clear : in an environment of private and public deleveraging from high debts , monetary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth .
fiscal austerity has exacerbated the impact of deleveraging by exerting a direct and indirect drag on growth .
lower public spending reduces aggregate demand , while declining transfers and higher taxes reduce disposable income and thus private consumption .
in the eurozone , a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed , with germany ’ s backing , by the european union , the international monetary fund , and the ecb have been a massive impediment to growth .
in japan , an excessively front-loaded consumption-tax increase killed the recovery achieved this year .
in the us , a budget sequester and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 2012-2014 .
and in the united kingdom , self-imposed fiscal consolidation weakened growth until this year .
globally , the asymmetric adjustment of creditor and debtor economies has exacerbated this recessionary and deflationary spiral .
countries that were overspending , under-saving , and running current-account deficits have been forced by markets to spend less and save more .
as fiscal austerity and asymmetric adjustment have taken their toll on economic performance , monetary policy has borne the burden of supporting faltering growth via weaker currencies and higher net exports .
but the resulting currency wars are partly a zero-sum game : if one currency is weaker , another currency must be stronger ; and if one country ’ s trade balance improves , another ’ s must worsen .
of course , monetary easing is not purely zero-sum .
easing can boost growth by lifting asset prices ( equities and housing ) , reducing private and public borrowing costs , and limiting the risk of a fall in actual and expected inflation .
given fiscal drag and private deleveraging , lack of sufficient monetary easing in recent years would have led to double and triple dip recession ( as occurred , for example , in the eurozone ) .
but the overall policy mix has been sub-optimal , with too much front-loaded fiscal consolidation and too much unconventional monetary policy ( which has become less effective over time ) .
a better approach in advanced economies would have comprised less fiscal consolidation in the short run and more investment in productive infrastructure , combined with a more credible commitment to medium- and long-term fiscal adjustment – and less aggressive monetary easing .
you can lead a horse to liquidity , but you can ’ t make it drink .
in a world where private aggregate demand is weak and unconventional monetary policy eventually becomes like pushing on a string , the case for slower fiscal consolidation and productive public infrastructure spending is compelling .
such spending offers returns that are certainly higher than the low interest rates that most advanced economies face today , and infrastructure needs are massive in both advanced and emerging economies ( with the exception of china , which has over@@ invested in infrastructure ) .
moreover , public investment works on both the demand and supply sides .
it not only boosts aggregate demand directly ; it also expands potential output by increasing the stock of productivity-boosting capital .
unfortunately , the political economy of austerity has led to sub-optimal outcomes .
in a fiscal crunch , the first spending cuts hit productive public investments , because governments prefer to protect current – and often inefficient – spending on public-sector jobs and transfer payments to the private sector .
as a result , the global recovery remains anemic in most advanced economies ( with the partial exception of the us and the uk ) and now also in the major emerging countries , where growth has slowed sharply in the last two years .
the right policies – less fiscal austerity in the short run , more public investment spending , and less reliance on monetary easing – are the opposite of those that have been pursued by the world ’ s major economies .
no wonder global growth keeps on disappointing .
in a sense , we are all japanese now .

a roadmap to end cholera
geneva – “ where is your toilet ? ” this is often the first question i ask when i visit the site of a cholera outbreak anywhere in the world .
we go wherever we can . ”
cholera , an ancient disease , has become a disease of poverty .
it does not discriminate geographically , but it pre@@ ys mostly on vulnerable communities in areas with poor sanitation .
carried by contaminated floodwaters to sources of drinking water , transported by unsuspecting travelers , or brought into homes on produce irrigated with untreated sewage , the vibrio cholerae bacterium settles in the small inte@@ stine after it is ingested , causing severe diarrhea and dehydration .
those who are fortunate enough never to have witnessed cholera ’ s effects firsthand might assume that it is just another stomach bug .
but without swift medical attention , cholera can sap the life out of an adult or child in a matter of hours .
each year , cholera claims the lives of an estimated 95,000 people ; many who die are children .
this year , images of listless , glas@@ sy-@@ eyed cholera victims awaiting treatment have emerged in countries worldwide .
the disease has spread at an unprecedented rate in yemen , where more than 2,000 people have died since april .
cholera outbreaks are ongoing in somalia , south sudan , haiti , and other countries across sub-saharan africa and asia .
but the saddest fact about cholera ’ s recent toll on human lives is that every single death was preventable .
the world already has the knowledge and tools to control cholera effectively , but existing resources are not being aligned with the necessary global commitments .
that is why the new global strategy developed by the global task force on cholera control , a diverse network of technical partners , is so vital .
ending cholera – a global roadmap to 2030 emphasizes a shift to proactive approaches , and aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90 % over the next decade .
with full implementation , the plan could also help as many as 20 countries eliminate disease transmission in the same timeframe .
based on three pillars – early detection , integrated prevention tactics , and coordination between countries and partners – the roadmap provides a concrete path for ending cholera as a public health threat .
once cholera grips a community , it becomes increasingly difficult to control .
it is important , therefore , that the disease is not forgotten even when it is not claiming victims .
a multi-sector approach that includes investments in water , sanitation , and hygiene – so-called wash services – can keep cholera at bay .
so can the proactive use of oral cholera vaccines and quick access to treatments , such as oral rehydration solution and intravenous fluids .
improving wash infrastructure is the most effective path to prevention , though implementing these services will take time in countries with fewer resources .
for this reason , the roadmap also encourages the preemptive and large-scale deployment of oral vaccines in cholera hotspots .
the vaccines work immediately , and can prevent cholera for up to three years , serving as a bridge to the implementation of longer-term solutions .
oral cholera vaccines are available via a global stockpile maintained by the world health organization , with support from gavi , the vaccine alliance .
more than 15 million doses have been distributed to 18 countries since the program ’ s creation in 2013 .
next year , the stockpile is set to increase to more than 25 million doses , up from two million when it began .
ending cholera as a health threat by 2030 , as global partners and the who recently pledged , will require sustained collaboration and commitment from cholera-@@ affected countries , technical partners , and international donors .
the goal may seem daunting , given that millions of people around the world are at risk of contracting the disease each year .
but with urbanization , climate change , and other factors likely to increase the threat of infection , it is a goal that must be met .
the roadmap makes this possible .
implementing the plan will prove to be a cost-effective solution for countries saddled with responding to frequent cholera outbreaks .
that is one reason why action is urgently needed .
but embracing the strategy is also the right thing to do for the international community .
governments have a moral obligation to ensure that no one succumbs to a preventable death .
it is an obligation the who shares , and it is why we will work hard to help the world meet the ambitious targets we have set .
we have the tools needed to beat cholera .
now , with a plan in place , there can no longer be any excuse not to put them to use .

a tipping point missed
washington , dc – before america and the world settle in firmly to the new donald trump@@ -based reality , let ’ s take a little trip down the road not taken .
suppose we had woken up last wednesday morning to a president-elect hillary clinton .
and let ’ s say that , instead of former portuguese prime minister antónio guterres , new zealand ’ s helen clark or bulgaria ’ s kristalina georgieva had been picked to succeed ban ki-moon as united nations secretary-general .
clinton would have joined the united kingdom ’ s theresa may and german chancellor angela merkel , helping achieve critical mass in the g7 .
and a female un secretary-general would have placed women at the helm of two of the world ’ s three biggest international organizations ( france ’ s christine lagarde already runs the international monetary fund ) .
with so many female leaders , we would have begun to answer the question : what happens when women run the world ?
would the world be better for women ?
would it even be different ?
according to sociologists , female leaders are of two schools : queen bees , who are less likely to help other women advance , and righteous women , who make the advancement of other women a priority .
most early pioneers , such as the uk ’ s margaret thatcher , india ’ s indira gandhi , and israel ’ s golda meir , were queen bees ; all of them eschewed feminism .
more recently , righteous women have prevailed .
leaders like argentina ’ s cristina kirchner , brazil ’ s dilma rousseff , and iceland ’ s jóhanna sigurðardóttir have all sought , in one way or another , to empower women and help them advance in their countries .
merkel and may have tended to be more like queen bees , while clinton , lagarde , clark , and georgieva are more like righteous women .
seeking to advance other women can highlight her own womanhood and thereby weaken her .
clinton , for example , was the third woman us secretary of state but the first who felt secure enough to be able to champion the cause of women and girls worldwide .
as president , she pledged , half her cabinet would be women , and she would further the state department initiatives launched during her tenure .
yes , she also would have been careful to avoid being defined as a woman president . still , just the presence of a plurality of women has an impact .
consider a woman ’ s perspective on conflict . evidence does not support the stereotype that women are more pacifist than men – the peacemakers and settlers of male disputes .
women can be amazons ; recall thatcher ’ s prosecution of the falklands war and her admonition to george h.w. bush not to “ go wobbly ” in the run-up to the first gulf war .
on the other hand , when men see wars , they naturally imagine the world of the warriors , whereas women see themselves in the women who must try to shelter their families from forces they cannot control .
that is precisely the diversity of perspective that is vital to decision-making .
and indeed , the institute for inclusive security at harvard ’ s kennedy school has tracked the differences women make as part of peace negotiations .
an acute awareness of the magnitude of civilian suffering in conflicts such as the syrian civil war or the ongoing horrors in the congo basin , and an appreciation of how cycles of violence perpetuate themselves over generations , can actually make women much more likely to urge the use of force in interventions .
former us secretary of state madeleine albright famously chided colin powell for his reluctance to involve the us military in the balkans in the 1990s , in part because of her own family ’ s experience as czech refugees from communism .
overall , a woman leader ’ s decisions are no more predictable than a male leader ’ s .
women are not monolithic : they have various ideological backgrounds and diverse governing styles .
but when the world finally reaches the point when women are not a rarity at the tables of power , when their numbers reach a tipping point , their voices will be heard differently , and their opinions will hold more weight with the men around them .
women came closer in 2016 than in any other era to reaching that tipping point .
but we may still have to wait decades to find out what will happen when we finally do .

madrid – world order – or the lack thereof – is a hot topic these days .
our fixation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere – in the news and at conferences , on bestseller lists , even in popular television shows .
people are anxious .
the world seems to be undergoing fundamental change : new actors are emerging on the world stage , previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied , and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors .
in our quest for structure and predictability – a natural impulse in times of rapid change – we are desperate for hints about how the world , and our role in it , will develop .
it is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best , or at least the most feasible , way forward ; predictability provides a foundation for cost-benefit analysis and strategic thinking .
the problem arises when our yearning for certainty overwhelms rational thinking , taking our ideas and actions in an unproductive – or even dangerous – direction .
faced with political , economic , geostrategic , and social uncertainty , policymakers have increasingly succumbed to the allure of nostalgia , promising a return to what they portray as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past .
in russia , president vladimir putin has been operating according to a nineteenth-century worldview , in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence unchallenged .
as he noted at last october ’ s meeting of the valdai discussion club , “ the bear will not even bother to ask permission .
here , we consider it the master of the taiga . ”
the islamic state is attempting to return to an even more distant past .
its adherents espouse a medieval nin@@ th-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate , in which “ the legality of all emirates , groups , states , and organizations becomes null ” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory .
the west , too , has fallen into the trap of nostalgia , clinging to a late-twentieth-century conception of order in which it makes the rules and can choose whether to follow them .
the latest example of this anachronistic perspective is america ’ s ham-fisted ( not to mention failed ) attempt to stem support for the china-led asian infrastructure investment bank , after repeatedly refusing to provide a greater voice for the world ’ s emerging powers in the bretton woods institutions .
nostalgia has also emerged as a major factor in many countries ’ domestic affairs .
throughout europe , populist parties – from the right-wing united kingdom independence party to the far-left syriza in greece – seek a return to the ostensibly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders . in the us , a prominent strain of jurisprudence defends the “ original intent ” of the constitution ’ s framers , while republicans are shifting toward isolationism and democrats are denouncing free-trade agreements .
but nostalgia offers no solutions – only a dream of escape .
looking backward gets us no closer to what we want ; on the contrary , it is a surefire way to miss the challenges – and miss out on the opportunities – that lie before us .
trying to advance one ’ s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today ’ s cross@@ word puzzle using yesterday ’ s clues .
let ’ s face it : the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return – before , say , the european union or the united nations or even the nation-state – never really existed .
as marcel proust noted : “ remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were . ”
the past is being abridged and sugarcoated in order to portray it as superior to the widespread tumult and misery of today .
over time , nostalgia has come to have a benign connotation .
but the word – a combination of the greek nostos ( home@@ coming ) and algos ( pain ) – was coined to describe the disease of “ acute hom@@ esi@@ ck@@ ness . ”
perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostalgia , at least in its political manifestation , as something more akin to an illness : a condition that distorts reality and impedes the formulation of effective solutions for real-world challenges .
no worldview rooted in the nineteenth century – much less in the ninth century – is adequate to the complexities of today ’ s globalized world .
likewise , the rise of new powers and non-state actors means that rule making ( and breaking ) can no longer be restricted to a small western club .
and the intensity of global competition means that european countries cannot hope to thrive independently of one another .
flimsy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative .
that is why a period of reflection on world order is so important .
but , rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia , we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them .

how press freedom is won
accra – every year on may 3 – world press freedom day – news producers and consumers pause to reflect on the state of global media .
this year , as journalists and government officials gather in ghana for the event ’ s 25th observance , attention will turn to the myriad pressures and challenges confronting the profession worldwide , and how official and state-sponsored hostility toward the press is threatening democracy .
signs of journalistic resilience are also emerging .
so , rather than focusing exclusively on the obstacles journalists around the world are facing , let ’ s mark may 3 by considering the many reasons for optimism .
for starters , while no media market is immune to erosion of press freedom , resistance is possible .
recent events in europe are illustrative .
in slovakia , public outrage over the politically motivated double murder of an investigative journalist , ján kuciak , and his fiancée , martina kušnírová , forced prime minister robert fico to resign , and has his successor , peter pellegrini , walking a public-relations tightrope .
hungary , too , has experienced its own , albeit tamer , version of journalistic pushback .
according to a recent study by the european journalism center , despite deepening government control over how the media operates , investigative reporting remains active , and “ abuses of the taxpayers ’ money are regularly exposed . ”
to be sure , the media are under attack like never before , and not only from fake news and polarizing presidents .
the slaying of nine journalists in kabul on april 30 , in back-to-back suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people , marked the deadliest day for journalists in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , and added to a grim global tally .
according to reporters without borders , more than 1,000 journalists have been murdered around the world in the last 15 years , and only a handful of the perpetrators have been brought to justice .
and yet fresh glimmers of hope are multiplying .
around the world , journalists and their supporters are fighting back in encouraging ways .
while governments from china to russia routinely block or filter access to the internet , half of the world ’ s population is now connected – a 20 % increase in only five years .
in sudan , journalists are using this connectivity to save lives .
last year , when the government refused to inform the public about a devastating cholera outbreak , journalists with radio dabanga , working with doctors and nurses , used the whatsapp messaging service to share information about prevention and treatment .
even in a violent and divided country like somalia , the internet is being used for good ; increased streaming speeds have kept members of the country ’ s sizable diaspora connected with friends and family , and have enabled meaningful dialogue across communities .
legal norms are also moving in the right direction .
between 2011 and 2016 , the number of countries with freedom of information laws increased from 90 to 112 .
this commitment was deepened last month when the european union adopted a new law to protect whistle-blowers from prosecution .
in a statement , authorities said they hoped the measure would be a boon to investigative journalists by protecting sources who report violations of european law .
where fewer legal protections are in place , journalists are becoming more creative .
in the philippines , where independent news organizations have become targets of slander by politicians and online trolls , reporters are turning the tables with devastating effect .
for example , in a recent series of reports identifying people making threats against the media , the news website rappler uncovered a network of trolls tied directly to government insiders .
finally , journalists are working to improve the diversity of their own industry .
in the democratic republic of congo , for example , one media organization created a database with the contact details of thousands of female experts who are available for media commentary and analysis .
this simple exercise has led to a dramatic increase in the percentage of female experts appearing in the press .
these are just a few of the bright spots we should be highlighting during this year ’ s observance of world press freedom day .
every day , courageous men and women ( and sometimes even children ) around the world continue to brave the odds to bring us the news .
we all benefit from their dedication , and we all have an obligation to honor their successes , not just their sacrifices .

worlds apart
macroeconomic policies , financial globalization , and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades , not only in income and wealth , but also in access to education , healthcare , social protection , as well as in political participation and influence .
even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth , an array of factors , exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes , has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge , social responsibility , and life chances from one generation to the next .
as surveyed in the united nations report the inequality predicament , few countries , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality , or to its consequences for education , health , and social welfare .
of course , there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence .
but inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability , threatening security .
excluded and facing bleak life prospects , young people , in particular , often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior , including violence .
nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty .
clearly , however , poverty arises from various complex conditions , and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach .
it is hard to imagine , for example , how to “ make poverty history ” without also generating enough decent work , educational opportunities , and healthcare for all .
to be sure , the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades .
access to education for girls has improved , and some gender gaps have been reduced .
despite aids and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems .
overall , however , the inequality gaps are large and , in many cases , growing .
the most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality , with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries .
meanwhile , growing unemployment , widening skill and productivity gaps , and the “ informali@@ zation ” or “ casualization ” of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide , as the number of “ working poor ” and the incidence of “ jobless growth ” has spread .
nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs , imposed since the 1980 ’ s , delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth .
growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years , despite more rapid growth in east asia , india , and a few other countries .
such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally .
but inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years , largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels .
indeed , in much of the world , such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government , while otherwise increasing overall inequalities .
the few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions .
but they are exceptions : the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries , with rising unemployment , greater earnings disparities , reduced social protection , and environmental degradation .
international financial liberalization , for example , has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities .
in addition , contrary to the promises of its proponents , financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term , while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity .
meanwhile , free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends .
developing countries ’ international terms of trade have worsened : prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures , as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture , and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights .
as a result , trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world , as in the case of garments this year .
and , while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries , the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters .
countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off .
the “ retreat of the state ” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government , including the capacity to lead and sustain development , as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education , health , housing , and utilities .
the economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start , and its consequences have become glaringly obvious .
unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction , the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart .

whither the multilateral trading system ?
brussels – free trade seems to have few supporters these days .
though actual trade volumes are recovering from the post-crisis recession and drop in commodity prices , “ globalization ” has become increasingly contentious , as exemplified by the election of us president donald trump on the back of a promise to rip up international agreements and get tough on trade partners .
what does this mean for the future of the rules-based trading system ?
some 60 years ago , when the current rules-based global trading system was conceived , the united states was the world ’ s sole economic “ hyperpower , ” possessing unquestioned dominance in the day ’ s most advanced manufacturing industries .
with enough power to impose rules , and enough dominance to be able to count on accruing the largest share of the benefits , it could – and did – perform the role of “ benevolent hegemon . ”
as japan and europe recovered from world war ii – with the latter getting an added boost from economic integration – america ’ s lead began to dwindle , and by the 1970s and 1980s , the us was sharing power over the world ’ s trade agenda with europe .
nonetheless , because the us and europe share so many common interests , they generally adhered to a cooperative approach .
it was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the us , fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits , that the country ’ s trade policy became more defensive , creating friction with many of its partners .
yet , even then , us leaders understood the value of the liberal multilateral trading system , and supported the establishment , in 1995 , of the world trade organization as the successor to the general agreement on tariffs and trade .
the wto ’ s creation amounted to a major step forward , as it addressed not just tariffs , but also other trade barriers , including indirect barriers arising from domestic regulations .
given the complexity of assessing how domestic regulations might impede trade , especially compared to judging whether a tariff has been correctly applied , the wto needed effective dispute-settlement mechanisms , with members agreeing to binding arbitration .
the system worked , because its major members recognized the legitimacy of independent panels , even if they sometimes deliver politically inconvenient judgments .
yet this recognition is now increasingly in doubt .
consider what type of economy would support a rules-based system .
after wwii , the us supported such a system , because of its unassailable economic supremacy .
an open rules-based system would also be highly appealing in a world comprising only small countries , none of which could hope to gain by relying on its relative economic power .
things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size , larger than the small economies from the previous example , but not large enough to dominate the system alone .
that is the scenario the nobel laureate economist paul krugman considered in a 1989 paper on bilateralism , in which he reported that a world consisting of three major trading blocs constitutes the worst constellation for trade , as a lack of explicit cooperation among all three would lead to increasing trade barriers .
unfortunately , this is exactly the situation in which the global economy finds itself today .
there are three dominant economies or trading blocs – china , the european union , and the us – with very similar trade volumes ( exports plus imports ) of around $ 4 trillion each .
( japan , which was a strong contender 25 years ago , now has a much smaller trade volume . )
together , the g3 economies account for 40 % of world trade and 45 % of global gdp .
with economic power distributed in this way , explicit cooperation by all three actors is crucial .
yet there are compelling reasons why they would be reticent to pursue such cooperation .
even if trump weren ’ t president , the current global trading system would present problems for the us , whose trade policy has long focused on manufactured goods .
( trade in raw materials has always been relatively free , and trade in agricultural goods has usually been considered special , and thus not subject to rules like the “ most favored nation ” principle , which applies to manufactures . )
because the us is now self-sufficient in energy , it needs to export fewer manufactured goods than industrialized countries with no domestic energy resources .
annual us exports of manufactured goods thus now amount to only about $ 1 trillion annually – significantly less than both the eu and china , which export almost twice as much in manufactured goods , despite having somewhat smaller economies .
to be sure , trump is unlikely to start an outright trade war , because any us tariff would harm the interests of the country ’ s largest companies , which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad .
yet no individual firm will be willing to give up much of its political capital to defend the rules-based system , either , because it would have to bear the losses , while its competitors shared the gains .
the same goes for the g3 trading blocs : if the eu expends political capital to stop the us from undermining wto mechanisms , china ( and the rest of world ) will reap most of the gains .
that dynamic goes some way toward explaining why china ’ s leaders , despite having proclaimed their support for the multilateral rules-based trading system , haven ’ t taken concrete action to reinforce it .
their reticence is probably intensified by the assumption that , within the current generation , their country will dominate the global economy ; at that point , they might no longer want to be bound by somebody else ’ s rules .
it does not help matters that the communist party of china has recently been empowered even further in all areas of the economy , with all major firms now having to accept a cpc representative on their board .
it is difficult to see how a dominant economic power governed by a single party – especially one with such extensive control over the economy – would accept the primacy of international rules and procedures over domestic considerations .
the conclusion is clear .
the world should prepare itself for the erosion of the rules-based trading system enshrined in the wto .

wrongheaded in rio
copenhagen – tens of thousands of people will soon gather in rio de janeiro for the united nations earth summit .
the participants , ranging from weary politicians to enthusiastic campaigners , are supposed to reignite global concern for the environment .
unfortunately , the summit is likely to be a wasted opportunity .
the un is showcasing the alluring promise of a “ green economy , ” focused on tackling global warming .
in fact , the summit is striking at the wrong target , neglecting the much greater environmental concerns of the vast majority of the world .
global warming is by no means our main environmental threat .
even if we assumed – unreasonably – that it caused all deaths from floods , droughts , heat waves , and storms , this total would amount to just 0.06 % of all deaths in developing countries .
in comparison , 13 % of all third world deaths result from water and air pollution .
so , for each person who might die from global warming , about 210 people die from health problems that result from a lack of clean water and sanitation , from breathing smoke generated by burning dirty fuels ( such as dried animal dung ) indoors , and from breathing polluted air outdoors .
by focusing on measures to prevent global warming , the advanced countries might help to prevent many people from dying .
that sounds good until you realize that it means that 210 times as many people in poorer countries might die needlessly as a result – because the resources that could have saved them were spent on windmills , solar panels , biofuels , and other rich-world fixations .
but of course , poor countries ’ tangible pollution problems are not trendy , and they do not engage outspoken campaigners , media , and governments the way that global warming can .
nowhere are the failed priorities better illustrated than in the un ’ s official , colorful “ rio + 20 ” leaflet .
here , the un helpfully provides a layman ’ s explanation of the summit , along with examples of its envisioned “ green economy ” in action .
we see scary pictures of dry riverbeds ( the result of global warming ) , along with plenty of pretty solutions like wind turbines and solar panels .
the problem is that green energy mostly is still much more expensive , less effective , and more intermittent than the alternatives .
yet , the summit literature claims that it will boost economic growth and eradicate poverty .
but seriously , why do well-meaning first worlders think that the third world should have energy technologies that are more expensive , feebler , and less reliable than their own ?
without a hint of irony , the leaflet is called “ the future we want . ” but , in a world where a billion people go to bed hungry , and where six million die each year from air and water pollution , most of those in the developing world likely have a very different set of priorities for their future .
the leaflet cheerfully claims that china ’ s shift “ to a low-carbon growth strategy based on the development of renewable energy sources &#91; has &#93; created jobs , income , and revenue . ”
in fact , over the past 25 years , china has quadrupled its co2 emissions .
while china does produce about half of the world ’ s solar panels , 98 % are exported to reap generous subsidies from rich-world markets .
only 0.00@@ 5 % of china ’ s energy comes from solar panels .
china ’ s decades-long economic expansion has lifted 600 million people out of poverty , but the enormous pollution that this has entailed does not fit into rio + 20 ’ s green narrative .
likewise , the bro@@ ch@@ ure explains that some farmers in uganda have embraced organic farming .
unfortunately , africa is almost entirely organic now – leading to low yields , hunger , and deforestation .
africa needs to boost its yields , and that means enabling farmers to use modern crops , fertilizers , and pesticides .
producing less with more effort might appeal to well-fed first worlders , but it is literally starving the poor .
reading further , the leaflet g@@ ushes that france has created 90,000 jobs in the green economy . but the stark reality remains hidden : the average cost of each green job is more than $ 200,000 per year , which french taxpayers patently cannot afford .
and economic models show that france has lost as many or more jobs because of the extra costs of the subsidies .
adding insult to injury , a beautiful photograph shows electric cars finishing the “ zero emissions race ” in geneva . omitted is the fact that most electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels , so the cars are anything but “ zero ” emissions .
and , more importantly , most of our planet ’ s inhabitants still dream of owning some form of mechanized transport – which is unlikely to be an electric vehicle with a price tag of $ 50,000 or more .
in a world plagued by serious problems caused by air and water pollution , this breez@@ y focus on trendy topics and unrealistic solutions is deeply disturbing .
a disconnected global elite is flying to rio to tell the world ’ s poor to have a solar panel .
rather than pandering to advanced countries ’ obsessions , rio + 20 could do more good for humanity – and the planet – by focusing on the top environmental problems and their simple solutions .

the wto reborn ?
new delhi – for too long , the world trade organization has languished , to lift a reference from t.s. eliot , by the “ waters of leman ” ( lake geneva ) .
once the world ’ s preeminent multilateral trade forum , the wto has been steadily marginalized in recent years , and recent rebukes of globalization , such as the united kingdom ’ s brexit vote and the election of donald trump as us president , suggest that this trend will accelerate .
but these outcomes may actually have the opposite effect , owing to three key developments that could enable the revival of the wto – and of the multilateralism that it embodies .
the first development is the decline of alternative trade arrangements .
the wto reached its peak in the early 2000s , a few years after the uruguay round of global trade negotiations concluded , and a time when more countries – most notably china – were acceding to the organization .
but major trade players like the united states and the european union subsequently shifted their focus from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral , regional , and mega-regional deals .
the mega-@@ region@@ als – namely , the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) – posed a particularly grave threat to the wto .
yet those are precisely the deals that the trump administration is rejecting , or at least postponing .
european integration had a similar impact on the wto , as it provided an alternative platform for managing intra-european trade .
but the european project has fallen on hard times , the most salient sign being the uk ’ s impending departure from the eu .
after brexit , the wto will probably become an important forum for britain ’ s trade relations with the world .
any further disintegration of the eu will only bolster that trend .
of course , it is possible that regional trade agreements in asia and elsewhere will continue to flourish .
but new leadership would have to emerge .
and no single systemically important country today meets the rigorous requirements of such leadership : internal political stability , economic dynamism , relatively contained risk , and a steadfast commitment to open markets .
however counterintuitive that may sound , a second development that bodes well for the wto ’ s revival is voters ’ increasing rejection of hyper-globalization .
it goes beyond creating open markets for goods and services to include increased immigration ( in the us and europe ) , harmonizing regulations ( the ambition of the tpp and the ttip ) , and intrusive adjudication of domestic policies ( the investor-@@ settlement procedures under nafta and the tpp ) .
in the eu ’ s case , it even entails a common currency .
for such integration , regionalism is much more effective than the wto .
now that “ deep ” is out , the wto could once again become an attractive forum for trading countries to do business .
make no mistake : there will still be a lot of globalization for the wto to facilitate and manage , not least because of the inexorable march of technology .
the mesh-like structure of trade and investment connecting countries , embodied in global value-chains – what aaditya mattoo of the world bank and i have called “ cri@@ ss-@@ crossing globalization ” – will prevent significant backsliding .
the third development that could reinvigorate the wto is a more protectionist stance by the trump administration .
if the us raises tariffs or implements a border-adjustment tax favoring exports and penalizing imports , its trade partners are likely to turn to the wto for adjudication , given the organization ’ s demonstrated dispute-settlement capability .
the wto could , therefore , become the place where us trade policies are scrutinized and kept in check .
the universality of wto membership , previously seen as an impediment to countries eager to move ahead with new rules and agreements , could be its main strength , as it implies a high degree of legitimacy , which is essential to minimize trade tensions and the risk of conflict .
in my book eclipse , i argued that multilateralism offered the best means for ensuring the peaceful rise of new powers .
but it seems that the same argument could apply equally well to the management of receding powers .
but the wto ’ s revival will not happen automatically .
willing stakeholders must actively pursue it .
the most obvious candidates for the job are the mid-size economies that have been the greatest beneficiary of globalization , and that , unlike the us and some european countries , are not currently under pressure from a globalization-@@ averse public .
the champions of multilateralism should include australia , brazil , india , indonesia , mexico , new zealand , south africa , the united kingdom , and possibly china and japan .
because none of them is large ( with the exception of china ) , they must work collectively to defend open markets .
moreover , they must open their own markets not only in the traditional areas of agriculture and manufacturing , but also in new areas such as services , investments , and standards .
in doing so , these countries would also be responding to the increasingly transactional approach to sustaining openness that the larger traders are being compelled to adopt .
the world needs a robust response to the decline of hyper-globalization .
multilateralism , championed by mid-size trading economies with a strong interest in preserving openness , may be it .
to the shores of leman they must now head .

the lost lessons of world war i
paris – it has been 100 years since world war i ended , and the centenary was commemorated this month with great pomp in australia , canada , france , and the united kingdom .
germany sent high-level authorities to france to mark the occasion , reaffirming the reconciliation between the two countries .
but the fact that franco-german reconciliation did not occur until europe had suffered another devastating war demonstrates how fragile peace can be , especially when political leaders are as shortsighted as they often are .
the cambridge historian christopher clark aptly titled his 2012 book on the origins of wwi the sleepwalkers .
through a combination of willful blindness , utter complacency , and intense stubbornness , europe ’ s leaders subjected their countries to a conflict that shattered an entire generation .
by the time wwi erupted , it should have been clear that industrialization and the transportation revolution had transformed warfare .
the crimean war of 1853-1856 had over one million casualties ; the american civil war of 1861-1865 resulted in over 600,000 deaths .
despite these experiences , europe ’ s leaders clung to the nineteenth-century military theorist carl von clausewitz ’ s dictum that , “ war is the continuation of politics through other means . ” so politics continued in the form of war , resulting in 20 million military and civilian casualties .
yet not even that was enough to wake up the sleepwalkers .
in the years following the armistice , europe ’ s leaders failed to transcend the divisions that wwi had laid bare , with the tensions between the french and germans being particularly destabilizing .
this failure was reflected in the armistice itself , which imposed excessively harsh requirements on germany , including billions of dollars in reparations payments , due at a time when the country faced a deep economic crisis .
meanwhile , international oversight was too weak , with the league of nations remaining largely silent in the face of dangerous developments , such as adolf hitler ’ s re@@ militarization of the rhineland .
the us senate ’ s rejection of the league of nations in 1919 – and thus of the principles of internationalism and multilateralism that president woodrow wilson had promoted – certainly didn ’ t help matters .
more fundamentally , wwii erupted because nationalism was allowed to continue to fester .
french prime minister georges clemenceau , for one , remained deeply nationalistic and , in particular , vehemently anti-german .
but while behaving like clemenceau might win the war ( especially if a power like the united states shows up to offer crucial help ) , it cannot win the peace ; hard nationalism naturally leads to conflict .
yet , today , a major world leader , us president donald trump , is behaving very much like clemenceau .
this holds serious implications not just for the us , but also for europe .
to be sure , french president emmanuel macron embraces the “ wilsonian principles ” that trump rejects .
but , as the interwar period starkly showed , if core rules and principles are not accepted by all , the institutions they underpin cannot be sustained .
wwii accomplished what even wwi could not : it ended the era of european global dominance .
while europe has grown and prospered since 1945 , it has not regained the global leadership status its major countries once possessed .
this leaves today ’ s european union at the mercy of a us that has rejected multilateralism and embraced nationalism .
of course , plenty of the risks europe faces lie within its own borders .
in france , for example , many are brushing off the warnings issued by macron – or , more concretely , by their history books – as they push back against their president ’ s efforts to take up the mantle of multilateralism .
the risk today is that generations that have not known war will reproduce the chain of events that lead to it .
this risk is exemplified by the recent “ yellow vest ” protests in france against an environmental tax on fuel .
the protests were also intended to be a broader rebuke of macron , whom many blame for their declining spending power .
the protesters probably think that they are acting in the spirit of the 1789 french revolution , a spirit that the french periodically revive in their country ’ s politics .
but they are actually reenacting the 1930s , with its right-wing protest movements and militias .
this is not to say that french citizens – and , in particular , young people – have nothing about which to complain .
unemployment has remained too high for too long , and while france has largely escaped the spike in income inequality seen in other countries , such as the us , systemic inequalities are pervasive .
but the fact is that the emotional rejection of any person or institution even remotely associated with established “ elites ” – including mainstream political parties and trade unions – lends itself to exploitation by populist demagogues .
and history could not be clearer about the risks generated when such demagogues secure power .
the world has changed profoundly over the last century .
our economies are more deeply intertwined than ever before , and the sheer scale of destruction that could be wrought by today ’ s weaponry may invite some semblance of restraint .
but , as trump ’ s erratic presidency – including his challenges to longstanding alliances and reckless nuclear posturing – starkly demonstrates , the structures we have created to preserve peace are far from foolproof .
with populations across the west embracing nationalistic and populist ideas , we are again dancing on the rim of a volcano .

putin on parade
new york – this may ’ s parade in moscow to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii promises to be the greatest victory day celebration since the soviet union ’ s collapse .
some 16,000 soldiers , 200 armored vehicles , and 150 planes and helicopters are set to pass through and over red square .
it will be a scene that would easily have been familiar to soviet leaders like leonid brezhnev and nikita khrushchev , taking the salute atop lenin ’ s tomb .
yet , though russia ’ s wwii allies were from europe and north america , no western leaders will attend the commemoration – a reflection of the west ’ s disapproval of putin ’ s invasion of ukraine and annexation of crimea .
instead , russian president vladimir putin ’ s high-profile guests will include the leaders of china , india , and north korea , underscoring just how few friends russia has these days .
the surreal nature of this gathering reflects the increasingly bizarre nature of putin ’ s regime .
indeed , watching russia nowadays is like watching the last installment of the x-men film franchise , “ days of future past . ”
just as the x-men in that film join forces with their younger selves to save mankind ’ s future , today ’ s kremlin is harking back to russia ’ s soviet past in what it sees as a contemporary fight for the country ’ s survival .
critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the west today with the germans who invaded russia in 1941 , while painting ukrainian government officials as “ fascists ” and “ neo-nazis . ”
the kremlin has relied on such claims , together with the supposed need to defend russians abroad , to justify its aggression against ukraine .
in putin ’ s speech following the annexation of crimea , he charged that the west ’ s refusal “ to engage in dialogue ” left russia with no choice . “ we are constantly proposing cooperation on all key issues , ” he declared .
a month later , putin reinforced this image of russians as the morally superior victims of a cruel and uncompromising west . “ we are less pragmatic than other people , less calculating , ” he asserted , before adding that russia ’ s “ greatness ” and “ vast size ” means “ we have a more generous heart . ”
it is not difficult to see the parallels between putin ’ s approach and that of joseph stalin , who declared at the start of wwii that the “ enemy ” aims to “ destroy ” russia ’ s “ national culture , ” to “ germani@@ ze ” its people , and “ convert them into slaves . ”
the difference , of course , is that the nazi wehrmacht actually invaded the soviet union , whereas ukraine simply wanted to decide its own future .
without defending stalin , one must recognize the immense soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the allied victory in wwii .
at the time , the military parade in red square – featuring almost 35,000 troops , up to 1,900 pieces of military equipment , and a 1,400-@@ man orchestra – was a well-deserved pageant .
the soviet leadership spared no cost in staging its military displays , which , in the absence of an external military threat , became an important vehicle for rallying national unity .
after the soviet union ’ s collapse , russia , no longer a superpower , put its military spectacles on ice .
but in 2005 , to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii , putin held a major parade – one that western leaders , believing that russia might have a european future , did attend .
the tone of this year ’ s victory day commemorations is far less anticipatory .
how can one celebrate the end of a war at a time when the descendants of those who fought it ( undoubtedly driven by the hope that future generations would live in peace ) are killing one another in a brutal little war in eastern ukraine ?
what is the point of grandiose fireworks displays amid the firing of real ho@@ witz@@ ers and rockets ?
the historian robert paxton believed that one could tell much about a country by its parades .
his 1966 book parades and politics at vichy describes how philippe pétain , as chief of state of vichy france , used pageantry , reactionary politics , and , of course , a partnership with adolf hitler to dupe his defeated country into believing that it still mattered in the world .
the vichy state ’ s brand of authoritarian traditionalism lionized family and fatherland , with pétain , a former military commander , serving as a kind of military king , exalted on the tribune .
the parallels with putin ’ s russia are clear .
putin views himself as a new czar .
his kgb background dictates his leadership style , which includes the abolition of free and fair elections , the persecution of opponents , and the promotion of conservative values that he , like pétain before him , juxta@@ poses with the corrupting influence of an “ immoral ” and “ decadent ” west .
relying on this approach , putin has built alliances with the likes of syria ’ s president bashar al-assad and egypt ’ s military ruler abdel fattah el-sisi .
china , the world ’ s second largest economy , is a useful addition to this collection of friendly anti-democratic states , as it has its own strategic grievances with the west .
unlike china , however , russia is not a rising superpower .
putin may try to portray his actions in ukraine as a fight against fascism .
but it is really a fight for relevance – a fight he will never win .
no matter how grand the parade , he cannot hide the truth : russia ’ s days as a superpower are in the past .
putin ’ s patriotism , like pétain ’ s , is that of the vanquished .

xi ’ s strong hand against trump
london – the world will soon witness a historic test of wills between china and the united states , two superpowers whose leaders see themselves as supreme .
in the immediate sense , it will be a battle over trade .
but also at stake is the strategic leadership of east asia and , eventually , the international order .
as things stand , china holds a stronger position than many people realize .
the question is whether chinese president xi jinping will feel confident or brazen enough to want to prove it .
the test of wills was hardly china ’ s choice ; but nor does it come as a surprise .
us president donald trump ’ s recently announced import tariffs on steel , aluminum , and other chinese-made goods are in keeping with his brand of economic nationalism .
and his decision to accept north korea ’ s invitation to hold bilateral talks on its nuclear program reflects the same “ bring it on ” attitude that he applied to the north ’ s earlier threats of war .
the upcoming test will be historic because it promises to reveal the true strengths and attitudes of the world ’ s rising power vis-à-vis the weakened but still leading incumbent power .
for better or worse , the result could shape the world for decades to come .
on the trade front , china ’ s large bilateral surplus with the us could mean that it has more to lose from a trade war , simply because it has more exports that can be penalized .
it is often said that surplus countries will always be the biggest losers in any tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs and other barriers .
but this assumption misses multiple points .
for one thing , china is more economically resilient to the effects of a trade war than it used to be .
trade as a share of its total economic activity has halved in the past decade , from more than 60 % of gdp in 2007 to just over 30 % today .
china also has major advantages in terms of domestic politics and international diplomacy .
as a dictatorship , china can ignore protests by workers and companies suffering from us tariffs .
in the us , where mid-term congressional elections will be held this november , the outcry from exporters , importers , and consumers facing higher costs will be heard loud and clear .
of course , trump , too , might ignore protests against his trade war if he is convinced that taking on china will please his core voters and win him re-election in 2020 .
but congressional republicans will probably feel differently , especially if their states or districts are among those being singled out by chinese import tariffs .
in terms of international diplomacy , trump ’ s trade war will help china present itself as the defender of the rules-based international order and multilateral institutions such as the world trade organization .
the wto does not recognize china as a market economy , owing to the chinese government ’ s significant involvement in industry and alleged theft of intellectual property .
but china will have a chance to play the victim , while arguing that the us now poses the single largest threat to the global trading system that it helped create .
and if a us-initiated trade war drags on , china ’ s case will become only stronger as more countries suffer the disruptive effects of tariffs .
of course , china may choose not to fight trump ’ s trade war at all .
with symbolic concessions – such as an agreement to import us-@@ produced liquefied natural gas or promises to offer new guarantees for intellectual-property rights – it could convince trump to stand down .
but if xi suspects that a show of strength will bolster china ’ s international standing while undercutting that of the us , he may decide to act accordingly .
but here , too , china will have an advantage .
even barring real progress in the talks , china already looks like a good global citizen .
over the past year , it has been pressuring the north korean leader , kim jong-un , to negotiate .
by participating in coordinated economic sanctions against the kim regime , and by reportedly capping vital exports of oil and other essentials to the north , china has played its part in bringing kim to the table .
on paper , the fundamental question is whether north korea will be willing to abandon its nuclear-weapons program , the fruit of more than 30 years of work .
and as china well knows , north korea would never give up its nuclear weapons without major changes in the military balance on and around the korean peninsula .
kim will likely offer to denuclearize solely on the condition that the us withdraw its forces from south korea , and perhaps from japan , too .
barring that , he would not feel secure enough to do without the nuclear deterrence on which he has staked his regime ’ s survival .
at best , he could agree on a process through which such extraordinary moves might be discussed at a later date .
either way , china comes out on top .
in the event of stalemate , it will have gotten kim to the table and put america in the position of being a refuseni@@ k .
and if the us does agree to any military concessions , china ’ s strategic position will be strengthened .
the only real question for xi , then , is whether he wants to assert china ’ s top-@@ dog status now , or sometime in the future .

the world according to xi
beijing – on november 15 xi jinping became general secretary of the chinese communist party and chairman of the ccp ’ s central military commission , giving him supreme authority over china ’ s armed forces .
next march , he will become president of china as well .
how does china ’ s new leader see the world , and how will he handle the country ’ s foreign policy ?
do his style and preferences differ significantly from those of his predecessor , hu jintao ?
the answers will determine china ’ s relations with the world , and vice versa , for the next decade .
china ’ s leaders approach power in a very different way than do political leaders in , say , the united states .
american politicians must sell their ideas and values to voters ; china ’ s leaders do not need to inform the press and the public directly about anything , including their foreign-policy positions .
indeed , with the notable exceptions of mao zedong and deng xiaoping , china ’ s leaders have seldom imposed their own personalities upon chinese diplomacy .
in this sense , xi ’ s leadership style will most likely continue in the tradition of his predecessors .
nevertheless , xi ’ s outlook and worldview are surely different from hu ’ s .
for starters , xi is part of a generation raised and educated mostly in china ’ s reform era , which has been a decisive influence in their lives .
china opened itself to the world in 1978 , when xi and his contemporaries were young men eager to understand the world outside china .
they are a generation inspired by deng ’ s realistic approach to shattering the walls that radical leftists had built around china , and one that believes that knowledge can change the destiny of the country and its people .
when this generation assumes the mantle of leadership , its members will turn their passion and curiosity about knowledge and innovation into real work .
they are surely willing to learn from the wider world as they seek to promote china ’ s national interests abroad and encourage gradual change at home .
xi may address chinese diplomacy ’ s thorniest issues – particularly sino-us relations – with more realism and flexibility than in recent years .
his visit to the us in february 2012 was widely regarded as a sequel to deng ’ s visit in january 1979 .
xi talked to president barack obama and visited the pentagon . he gave a luncheon speech and saw old friends from his brief stay in iowa as a young man .
he showed interest in american culture , just as deng did in 1979 .
he ate chocolate and watched nba games .
most important , instead of spending countless hours drearily discussing political and strategic topics , he spoke directly and vigorously about the current state of sino-us relations . “ the pacific ocean is wide enough to accommodate the two major countries of china and the us , ” he declared .
unhappy with america ’ s “ pivot ” to asia , xi remained calm , but emphasized that “ one cannot rely too much on military power regarding asia-pacific diplomacy . ”
similarly , xi tried to avoid major arguments on human rights , saying simply , “ there ’ s no best , only better . ” in essence , he sought to demonstrate that however many questions , arguments , and even potential conflicts exist between china and the us , both countries ’ leaders should address them with an attitude of cooperation and sincerity .
leaders should not become entangled in details that fuel suspicion of their counterparts ’ motives , lest they lose sight of the bigger picture .
xi ’ s confidence extends to china ’ s domestic politics .
his generation is more certain of reform than previous leadership cohorts were , owing less to official ideology than to the country ’ s enormous achievements in the last three decades .
in practice , xi may well prove to be a nationalist ; certainly , his generation , like the founding fathers of the people ’ s republic , dreams of turning china into a stronger , more prosperous country .
the country ’ s new leaders want the world ’ s applause , but they are more eager for domestic ov@@ ations .
like previous chinese leaders , xi firmly believes that the world should respect china ’ s authority to manage its own affairs .
thus , he is willing to show diplomatic muscle if china is challenged on a core area of concern .
his speech in mexico in 2009 demonstrated this . “ some foreigners with full bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger-pointing at us , ” he said .
“ first , china does not export revolution ; second , it does not export famine and poverty ; and , third , it does not mess around with you .
so what else is there to say ? ”
xi understands that the world expects not only a better china , but also a china that is committed to constructing a better world .
he will be a tough and strong-@@ minded leader , but one who understands the world in a pragmatic way and knows how to work well with his foreign counterparts .
indeed , his 2012 visit to the us left two impressions .
first , he is a leader at ease both in front of and away from the television cameras .
second , he is not afraid to have a little fun .
with those simple touches of humanity , xi could bring a revolution to china ’ s diplomacy .

new york – the contrast between the disarray in the west , on open display at the nato summit and at last month ’ s g7 meeting in canada , and china ’ s mounting international self-confidence is growing clearer by the day .
last month , the communist party of china ( cpc ) concluded its central conference on work relating to foreign affairs , the second since xi jinping became china ’ s undisputed ruler in 2012 .
these meetings are not everyday affairs .
they are the clearest expression of how the leadership sees china ’ s place in the world , but they tell the world much about china as well .
the last such conference , in 2014 , marked the funeral of deng xiaoping ’ s dictum of “ hide your strength , bide your time , never take the lead , ” and heralded a new era of international activism .
in part , this change reflected xi ’ s centralization of control , chinese leaders ’ conclusion that american power is in relative decline , and their view that china had become an indispensable global economic player .
since 2014 , china has expanded and consolidated its military position in the south china sea .
it took the idea of the new silk road and turned it into a multi-trillion-dollar trade , investment , infrastructure , and wider geopolitical / geo-economic initiative , engaging 73 different countries across much of eurasia , africa and beyond .
and china signed up most of the developed world to the first large-scale non-@@ bretton woods multilateral development bank , the asian infrastructure investment bank .
china has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in east asia , as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 iran nuclear deal .
it has developed naval bases in sri lanka , pakistan , and djibouti , and participates in naval exercises with russia as far away as the mediterranean and the baltic .
in march , china established its own international development agency .
the emergence of a coherent grand strategy ( regardless of whether the west chooses to recognize it as such ) is not all that has changed since 2014 .
for starters , the emphasis on the cpc ’ s role is much stronger than before .
xi , concerned that the party had become marginal to the country ’ s major policy debates , has reasserted party control over state institutions and given precedence to political ideology over technocratic policymaking .
xi is determined to defy the trend-line of western history , to see off francis fukuyama ’ s “ end of history ” culminating in the general triumph of liberal democratic capitalism , and preserve a leninist state for the long term .
this approach – known as “ xi jinping thought ” – now suffuses china ’ s foreign policy framework .
in particular , xi ’ s view that that there are identifiable immutable “ laws ” of historical development , both prescriptive and predictive , was particularly prominent at last month ’ s foreign policy conference .
if this sounds like old-fashioned dialectical materialism , that ’ s because it is .
xi embraces the marxist-leninist tradition as his preferred intellectual framework .
given its emphasis on iron laws of political and economic development , a dialec@@ tical-@@ materialist worldview means that there is nothing random about world events .
so , xi argues , if marx ’ s analytical framework is applied to the current period , it is clear that the global order is at a turning point , with the west ’ s relative decline coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances enabling china ’ s rise .
in xi ’ s words , “ china has been in the best period of development since modern times , while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a century . ” of course , formidable obstacles lie ahead for china .
but xi has concluded that the obstacles facing the us and the west are greater .
how such thinking will now drive china ’ s concrete foreign policy is anyone ’ s guess .
but how one-party states , particularly marxist states , choose to “ ide@@ ate ” reality matters a great deal : it is how the system speaks to itself .
and xi ’ s message to china ’ s foreign policy elite is one of great confidence .
specifically , the central conference called for the country ’ s international policy institutions and personnel to embrace xi ’ s agenda .
here xi seems to have the foreign ministry in his sights .
there is a strong ideological flavor to xi ’ s apparent frustration with the ministry ’ s glacial approach to policy innovation .
china ’ s diplomats were urged to bear in mind that they are first and foremost “ party cadres , ” suggesting that xi is likely to push the foreign policy apparatus toward greater activism , to give full effect to his emerging global vision .
the biggest change to emerge from last month ’ s conference concerns global governance .
in 2014 , xi referred to an impending struggle for the future structure of the international order .
while he did not elaborate , much work has since been devoted to three inter-related concepts : guoji zhixu ( the international order ) ; guoji xitong ( the international system ) , and quanqiu zhili ( global governance ) .
of course , these terms have different and overlapping meanings in english , too .
but , broadly speaking , in chinese , the term “ international order ” refers to a combination of the united nations , the bretton woods institutions , the g20 , and other multilateral institutions ( which china accepts ) , as well as the us system of global alliances ( which china does not ) .
the term “ international system ” tends to refer to the first half of this international order : the complex web of multilateral institutions that operate under international treaty law and seek to govern the global commons on the basis of the principle of shared sovereignty .
and “ global governance ” denotes the actual performance of the “ international system ” so defined .
what is startlingly new about xi ’ s remarks at the central conference was his call for china now to “ lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of fairness and justice . ”
this is by far the most direct statement of china ’ s intentions on this important question offered so far .
the world should buckle up and get ready for a new wave of chinese international policy activism .
like much of the rest of the international community , china is acutely conscious of the dysfunctionality of much of the current multilateral system .
so xi ’ s wish to lead “ reform of the global governance system ” is no accident .
it reflects growing diplomatic activism in multilateral institutions , in order to reorient them in a direction more compatible with what china regards as its “ core national interests . ”
xi has reminded china ’ s international policy elite that the tot@@ ality of china ’ s future foreign policy direction , including the reform of global governance , must be driven by these core national interests .
in this context , china also wants a more “ multipolar ” international system .
this is code for a world in which the role of the united states and the west is substantially reduced .
the challenge for the rest of the international community is to define what type of global order we now want .
what do existing institutions like the european union , the association of southeast asian nations , or the african union want for the international rules-based system for the future ?
what exactly does the us want , with or without trump ?
and how will we collectively preserve the global values embodied in the un charter , the bretton woods institutions , and the universal declaration of human rights ?
china has a clear script for the future .
it ’ s time for the rest of the international community to develop one of its own .
this is an edited version of an address delivered to the lee kuan yew school of public policy at the national university of singapore .

xi of arabia
beijing – those who have criticized china ’ s cautious foreign policy need to reconsider their position , following president xi jinping ’ s just-completed visit to saudi arabia and iran – two major middle eastern powers that are currently at each other ’ s throats .
the visits reflect the more active foreign-policy approach that xi has spearheaded , particularly in the middle east .
this new approach raises an important question : can china ’ s impact on the region be more constructive than that of the united states ?
now is certainly a tense time to become involved in the middle east , a region where , as richard n. haass argues , a new thirty years ’ war , in which “ civil wars and proxy wars become impossible to distinguish , ” is unfolding .
a key factor in unleashing the current chaos – which represents the convergence of numerous deep-rooted challenges and conflicts – was america ’ s 2003 invasion of iraq .
by eliminating saddam hussein ’ s sunni regime , the us paved the way for a shia-led government , a development that tilted the regional balance of power toward iran and left sunni-ruled saudi arabia feeling encircled by a shia coalition .
that is why iran and saudi arabia are so deeply involved in syria ’ s civil war .
they know that the fate of president bashar al-assad ’ s alawite regime will have significant implications for the regional order .
for saudi arabia , reining in iran is all the more important in the wake of the recent agreement on the country ’ s nuclear program , which has resulted in the lifting of international economic sanctions that have long constrained iran ’ s regional leadership ambitions .
of course , neither saudi arabia nor iran – or turkey , which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confrontation .
these countries would rather empower other actors , even if it means fueling dangerous religious radicalization and the privatization of violence .
the terrorist movements that have emerged as a result of this approach – namely , the islamic state – cannot be defeated using traditional counter-terrorism operations .
to be sure , these middle east rivals are not the only ones involved in the region ’ s current quagmire .
external powers like france , russia , and , of course , the us are also deeply involved , each with its own geopolitical objectives .
now china is entering the fray , bringing a uniquely constructive vision with it .
the two characters that comprise the chinese word for crisis ( 危机 ) mean , individually , “ danger ” ( 危 ) and “ opportunity ” ( 机 ) .
that is precisely what china sees in today ’ s middle east .
for most of the relevant actors , highly perilous geopolitical competition is overshadowing vast economic opportunities .
not for china .
as xi put it on his recent visit to cairo : “ instead of looking for a proxy in the middle east , we promote peace talks ; instead of seeking any sphere of influence , we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the belt and road initiative . ”
this reflects the broader foreign-policy rebalancing that xi has been pursuing since taking office in 2013 .
unlike the us , which has been engineering a strategic “ pivot ” from one geographic region to another , china is rebalancing from “ politics among nations ” to “ politics among networks , ” focusing on “ connectivity ” rather than “ control . ”
the middle east is crucial to this connectivity-@@ oriented grand strategy , not least because of its key role in the “ one belt , one road ” project that xi promoted in cairo .
china ’ s determination to reestablish the ancient silk roads – including the overland route that runs through the middle east – has led it to enter into strategic partnerships with eight arab countries in recent years , and to sign agreements with six arab countries to pursue the initiative jointly .
iran , turkey , and seven arab countries are among the founding members of the beijing-based asian infrastructure investment bank , a key institution for financing related infrastructure projects .
but china is not waiting for the one belt , one road initiative to be completed before pursuing increased trade with middle eastern countries .
during his recent visit to saudi arabia , he claimed that free-trade negotiations between the gulf cooperation council and china should be concluded this year .
moreover , xi announced that china will issue $ 55 billion in loans to the middle east , including a $ 15 billion special loan for industrialization , $ 10 billion in commercial loans to boost production capacity , and $ 10 billion in concessional loans .
the remaining $ 20 billion will go toward a joint investment fund with the united arab emirates and qatar to invest in traditional energy , infrastructure development , and high-end manufacturing industries in the region .
all of this aligns with the “ 1 + 2 + 3 ” cooperation pattern that xi proposed at the june 2014 ministerial conference of the china-@@ arab states cooperation forum in beijing .
according to this approach , energy cooperation should form the core of collaboration , while infrastructure construction and trade and investment form two wings .
nuclear power , satellites , and new energy sources are three high-tech areas where cooperation can lead to important breakthroughs .
here , the goal is to take advantage of the region ’ s energy resources , while helping it to industrialize and diversify its economy .
of course , china ’ s success in the middle east requires progress on mitigating the region ’ s tensions , cooling its hotspots , and stabilizing weak countries – all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors .
but peace and development are inextricably linked .
to turn the tide against extremism , middle eastern countries must be able to provide economic opportunities to their people , and these can only be secured through trade , investment , and jobs .
in this fundamental respect , china has a lot to offer the middle east – and president xi has once again shown his determination to offer it .

new haven – china ’ s quinqu@@ ennial communist party congresses are that rare event where ritual and dogma combine with introspection and strategy .
the 19th national congress , which began on october 18 , is no exception .
notwithstanding the suspense over potential changes in party leadership , which typically occur at the end of the meeting , president xi jinping ’ s political report , delivered on the opening day , was a high-impact event .
significantly , it says as much about the party as it does about xi .
as alice miller , a leading sinologist at stanford ’ s hoover institution , emphasizes , the report was carefully crafted over a one-year period to convey the consensus of the party ’ s highest organ , the 20@@ 5-@@ member central committee .
three conclusions from xi ’ s address are particularly important .
for starters , the ideological underpinnings of “ xi jinping thought ” have been raised to the same lofty level as those of “ mao zedong thought , ” effectively elevating xi over his three predecessors – hu jintao , jiang zemin , and even the revered deng xiaoping .
much has been written about xi ’ s consolidation of power since he was appointed general secretary in november 2012 .
but this elevation makes it official .
after only five years in office , the party leadership has anointed xi as one of modern china ’ s two greatest historic figures .
second , the political report speaks with great confidence about a china that has now entered a “ new era . ”
but by underscoring the chinese adage that the “ … last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point , ” xi sketched an even more ambitious future .
china ’ s sights are now set on two goals – completing the task of building the so-called moderately prosperous society by 2035 , and then establishing its position as a great power by 2050 .
unlike china ’ s goal-setting exercises in the past , there are no quantitative targets attached to these “ twin centenary goals ” ( which roughly align with the party ’ s founding in 1921 and the establishment of the people ’ s republic of china in 1949 ) .
they celebrate the long-awaited national rejuvenation that xi has dubbed the china dream .
the third point is perhaps the most intriguing .
this is couched in the form of china ’ s “ principal contradiction ” – a marxist concept that serves as an admission of a fundamental problem requiring resolution .
the principal contradiction , while typically elliptical and ambiguous , frames a rich discussion of risks and opportunities , strategy and tactics , reforms and governance – all of which will shape china ’ s prospects for the foreseeable future .
the big news is that , under xi ’ s leadership , the party has revised its principal contradiction for the first time since 1981 .
whereas the contradiction had previously been framed as a tradeoff between the needs of the people and china ’ s “ backward social production , ” it is now viewed as a tension between “ unbalanced and inadequate development ” and the “ people ’ s ever-growing needs for a better life . ”
this restatement of the principal contradiction has not emerged from thin air .
it clearly signals a far-reaching change in national perspective – from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosperous society focused on becoming a great power .
it is also consistent with the critique of former premier wen jiabao , who in march 2007 famously warned of a chinese economy that was becoming increasingly “ unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and &#91; ultimately &#93; unsustainable . ”
over the past ten years , two five-year plans – the 12th , enacted in 2011 , and the 13th , enacted in 2016 – plus a major set of reforms adopted at the so-called third plenum in 2013 , have aimed to resolve china ’ s persistent and worrisome imbalances .
xi ’ s political report doesn ’ t alter the main thrust of those efforts .
the real significance is that rebalancing is now enshrined within the party ’ s ideological underpinnings .
it is a foundational pillar of xi jinping thought .
the political report ’ s focus on china ’ s principal contradiction also raises important questions about what still may be missing from the party ’ s long-term strategy .
three “ secondary contradictions ” are especially striking on the economic front .
first , there is ongoing tension between the role of the state and that of markets in guiding resource allocation .
this was a glaring contradiction of the 2013 third plenum reforms , which focused on the seemingly inconsistent combination of a “ decisive role ” for markets and steadfast support for state ownership .
the party has long believed that these two features of economic life are compatible – the so-called blended economy with chinese characteristics .
xi ’ s political report praises the mixed ownership model and also aspires to an economy led by great firms with unmatched global competitive prowess .
but it glosses over the thorny issue of state-owned enterprise reform that may be required to resolve this contradiction and avoid the japanese “ zombie ” problem of a chronic debt overhang .
second , there is the tension between supply and demand .
consistent with other recent pronouncements of senior chinese officials , the political report leaves little doubt that supply-side structural reforms are now the highest priority of economic policymakers .
the related emphasis on productivity , innovation , pruning excess capacity , and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are underscored as key building blocks of this effort .
at the same time , the report de-emphasizes consumer spending and services – now buried deep in the list of priorities for a modernized economy .
yet focusing on supply without paying equal attention to the foundations of aggregate demand is a puzzling and potentially worrisome disconnect .
a final secondary tension can be found in the contrast between the path and the destination .
notwithstanding all the self-congrat@@ ulatory flourishes in xi ’ s political report , there is good reason to believe that the chinese economy is only in the early stages of its long-@@ heralded structural transformation .
its services sector is growing rapidly , but is still embryonic , accounting for just 52 % of gdp .
and household consumption , which is also growing rapidly , is still less than 40 % of gdp .
china may well be on a path to a new normal or a new era .
but the final destination remains far down the road , with many contradictions to be resolved during the journey .

yale ’ s safe sex criminals
new york – in october 2010 , the current brothers of george w. bush ’ s former fraternity at yale , delta kappa epsilon , marched through the first-year qu@@ ad chanting , “ no means yes !
yes means anal ! ” they held up signs reading , “ we love yale slu@@ ts . ”
sixteen graduate and undergraduate students , male and female , felt that the university ’ s administration then did little to push back against such encroachments on female students ’ rights to a fair and non-threatening learning environment .
in march , they filed a federal lawsuit against yale , alleging that its “ failure to address incidents of sexual harassment and sexual assault has created a ‘ hostile environment . ’ ”
the lawsuit did not stop with the d@@ ke incident .
first-year women were ranked on their sex appeal , the complaint noted , and , most seriously , yale failed to respond adequately to reports of sexual assault or attempted assault and stalking .
according to alexandra brodsky , a yale junior and one of the 16 complainants , the students are “ really frustrated and disappointed that yale again and again fails to respond to both public and private acts of sexual harassment and assaults , which … perpetuates an environment in which these … acts are okay . ”
the students ’ complaint coincides with a federal investigation by the department of education ’ s office for civil rights , which announced that it would review yale ’ s policies for dealing with sexual harassment and sexual assault .
this is no small matter : yale and other american universities receive millions of federal dollars annually – money that would be jeopardized if the university was found to tolerate an unequal learning environment .
in 2004 , i wrote an article for new york magazine about my own experience of having been sexually encroached upon as a third-year undergraduate at yale by an esteemed professor ( the crime of “ sexual harassment ” had not yet been codified ) .
i wrote , too , about yale ’ s cover-up of many situations like mine .
so the students ’ lawsuit was not surprising to me .
indeed , in the course of trying to report to the university in 2004 what had happened to me in 1983 , i found the same pattern of stonewalling victims and defending perpetrators .
worse still , i discovered that the university and its lawyers used the sexual harassment “ grievance procedure ” as a screen to protect the institution , its harassers , and even its rapists , rather than as a means to investigate incidents of abuse .
this situation had persisted for two decades .
as i conducted my reporting , i heard woman after woman allege that the same professor or the same fraternity had engaged in multiple instances of assault or harassment .
victim after victim would plead , heartbreakingly , “ help me . ”
but i could do nothing , because the women chose to remain anonymous , and because the university treated each case as top secret .
alleged perpetrators were free to teach in a new university – where more young women ( and in some cases , young men ) would become their prey .
compounding the lack of transparency , yale maintains its own campus police force , to which sex-crime victims are encouraged to report their complaints if they insist upon formal documentation .
but victims often do not understand that this actually tends to contain potentially embarrassing scandals , by preventing real – that is , accountable – law enforcement from getting involved .
indeed , there have been disclosed to me reports of at least three alleged sex assaults by faculty or academic staff in the past decade – two alleged incidents reported by two different women involving the same man .
i know that one undergraduate has more recently pursued legal action against a staff member , who , she said , drugged her with rohypnol , the “ date rape ” drug , and assaulted her .
i know these accounts , but i can ’ t report them , even at this critical moment in the long-overdue formal investigation , because of confidentiality protocols .
each of these women feels alone .
like virtually every private university in the united states , yale has relied on “ privacy ” to keep these incidents under wraps , so that incoming women ( and men ) have no idea who among the faculty or students is dangerous ; which fraternity is a site of repeated harassment or worse ; and when to keep the door open on a student-@@ teacher meeting .
like the catholic church , private universities like yale can use victims ’ shame and isolation to disen@@ franchise them and to protect the perpetrators .
but i believe that the victims themselves have a responsibility .
the convention of taking sex-crime testimony from alleged victims behind closed doors , under conditions of anonymity or confidentiality , only serves institutions like universities or the military that are intent on covering up criminal behavior .
some feminists have attacked me for this position , but the numbers bear me out : thirty years ago , 30 % of reported rapes in the us and the united kingdom resulted in prosecutions ; today , after three decades of confidential sex-crime reporting , the number is 12 % in the us and 6 % in the uk .
this is largely because confidentiality in sex-crime reporting prevents the media from shining a light on the crime , inhibits institutional memory of repeated assailants , and prevents scrutiny of whether a court , college , or police precinct is doing better or worse at handling such cases .
as a result , serious crimes can be swept under the rug – at yale and at every other private us university i have ever visited ( public universities are less free to conceal crime data ) – in the guise of “ protecting the victims . ”
yale alumnae are reportedly now contac@@ ting these 16 students with their own stories of sexual assault and harassment , spanning two decades .
but if they had come forward publicly years ago , it is likely that yale could not have continued for so long to protect the sex criminals in its midst .
the students are right : a sexually abusive environment does make it harder for students to study and learn .
but victims – whether current students or alumnae – would be well advised to take a deep breath , come forward , and tell their stories out loud .
only then would yale and other institutions be forced to reckon publicly with a problem that has persisted for generations .

yankee bases go home
rio de janeiro – last month , the leaders of all 12 countries of south america ( except one ) gathered in quito , ecuador ’ s capital , for the summit of the union of south american nations .
unasur or unasul ( depending on whether one speaks spanish or portuguese ) was established by the twelve presidents in brasília in may 2008 with the aim of furthering economic and political integration .
instead , venezuelan president hugo chávez hijacked the quito meeting to propagate his bolivarian revolution and expound his own ideas for the continent ’ s future as independent of the united states .
thanks to america ’ s recently announced military agreement with colombia , chávez ’ s ideas got more of a hearing than might have been expected .
for , instead of infrastructure plans , commercial or environmental treaties , or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty , the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new us-@@ colombian military agreement , announced less than a month before the summit .
to no one ’ s surprise , chávez dominated the criticism of the pact .
he claimed that the “ winds of war are blowing , ” and that the announcement of the military agreement “ can transform itself into a tragedy . ”
unfortunately , colombian president álvaro uribe was absent from the meeting .
colombia and ecuador broke diplomatic relations in march 2008 , after colombia ’ s army pursued farc guerillas , who have been fighting colombia ’ s government for decades , into ecu@@ ado@@ re@@ an territory .
so uribe could not defend the new military agreement .
this left the floor open to chávez to isolate colombia and preach against the us .
in a continent where anti-americanism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolidate national cohesion and political power , chávez ’ s attacks found a ready audience .
in addition , uribe ’ s absence allowed chávez to avoid responding to colombia ’ s accusations that venezuela and its ally ecuador support the narco-@@ marxist farc .
one week after the summit , us secretary of state hillary clinton tried to calm the continent ’ s fears about the us-colombia agreement , explaining that it is merely a minor revision of the bill clinton-era plan colombia , an american program to support the government against the drug cartels .
but her words did little soothing .
nor did it seem to help that even most local military analysts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the us military position on the continent .
the simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the pact was terrible , and gave a platform for bolivarian rants that will not be without consequences .
indeed , the ongoing fallout is likely to remain very negative .
by raising anti-american suspicions and strengthening chávez ’ s position across the continent , the agreement weakens the influence of brazil .
recently , brazil had been differentiating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system , both of which were helping the country ’ s poor .
so the spread and strengthening of chávez ’ s so-called bolivarian revolution was not in brazil ’ s interests , even though some of president luiz inácio lula da silva ’ s officials appear to be fans of chávez and his administration .
the terrible timing of the us-colombia military agreement also gave chávez and his allies a reason to build up their armies against the “ evil imperialist ianque . ”
after all , one must remember , the bolivarian revolution ’ s supposed “ enemy � � is the us , and no one else .
so the agreement may legitimize and produce an arms race in south america , which is in no one ’ s interest .
another unexpected consequence of the us-colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between venezuela and colombia .
the radical polarization of the andean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the amazon , as well as weakening the brazilian project for south american political and economic integration .
finally , another major consequence of the us-colombia deal are the doubts that it has created in latin america about president barack obama ’ s administration , and about the future of relations between the us and south america , especially brazil , the main regional power .
the agreement revived the perception that us diplomacy lacks sensitivity where the region is concerned .
if obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in south america , and to bolster brazil ’ s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region ’ s radical and undemocratic forces , it must take greater care in not appearing to undermine those the us claims to support .
for chávez is showing that the old cry of “ yankee go home ” still resonates .

the periphery ’ s purgatory
athens – german chancellor angela merkel ’ s upcoming visit to athens will be a far less tense affair than her earlier journeys here during europe ’ s long financial crisis .
of course , greeks have little love for merkel ; but , thanks to europe ’ s modest economic recovery , some of the poison has been drawn from germany ’ s relations with europe ’ s most damaged and distressed economies .
indeed , europe is no longer considered a risk to global financial stability .
the eurozone ’ s core economies are showing signs of revival , and financial conditions in the over-indebted periphery are improving as well .
but , given capital shortages , depressed demand , and the slow pace of reform in the eurozone periphery , continued progress is far from certain .
in the eurozone economies that were hit hardest by the global economic crisis , the output and employment losses have been huge and persistent .
real ( inflation-adjusted ) per capita income in the eurozone as a whole hovers around its 2007 level ; in greece and italy , however , it has sunk to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997 , respectively .
meanwhile , the eurozone ’ s overall unemployment rate is 12 % , and it is much higher in the periphery .
in spain , more than 25 % of the labor force is jobless , while italy ’ s youth unemployment rate stands at 42 % .
in greece , where the overall unemployment rate has climbed to 28 % , some 60 % of the country ’ s young people are unemployed .
recovering from such crippling employment losses will not be easy , and will require a speedy return to high and sustainable growth rates .
consider greece , where the government is planning a return to the capital markets in the coming months to finance the country ’ s long-term borrowing needs , even though securing such financing would require paying unsustainably high interest rates .
the fact that the government seems willing to do so translates clearly its desire to move beyond the influence of the “ troika ” ( the international monetary fund , the european commission , and the european central bank ) .
indeed , since 2008 , greece ’ s gdp has shrunk by almost 25 % .
recovering lost capacity will require large amounts of capital , but there are five reasons why such financing is unlikely , under present conditions , to be forthcoming :
· as a result of austerity , public investment as a share of gdp continues to fall and has now reached a record low .
having already committed substantial rescue funds , eurozone authorities do not seem inclined to inject fresh capital .
· sources of domestic private capital are limited , because the recession and the related near-collapse of asset prices , along with a sharp increase in taxation – particularly on high incomes and on capital – significantly weakened balance sheets .
· bank lending has slowed drastically , as a result of greek banks effectively defaulting in the wake of the troika-@@ imposed losses on sovereign creditors and the nationalization of the country ’ s banks .
a record-low level of deposits and the recession@@ -related rise of non-performing loans have weakened greek banks ’ capital position further .
( today , companies in the eurozone periphery borrow at substantially higher rates than their counterparts in the core .
for bank loans , the ratio is almost two to one ; for long-term financing , it may reach as high as ten to one . )
· greece ’ s unsustainable debt position is discouraging foreign private investment .
the assumptions about primary surpluses , private-sector involvement , and gdp growth underlying the government ’ s commitment to reduce its debt level , which currently exceeds 170 % of gdp , to 124 % of gdp by 2020 cannot be realized , given germany ’ s opposition to restructuring the official financing that replaced the defaulted private loans .
some easing of loan conditionality – via extended maturities and reduced interest rates ‒ will be agreed later this year , but it will not be enough to calm fears of a new default .
· trust between foreign and greek investors is lacking , and it will not be restored until debt sustainability is achieved .
but germany and the other core eurozone countries consistently block any proposal that contemplates debt mutualization or fiscal union .
ideas such as eurobonds , a single european finance ministry , and increased capitalization of europe ’ s common rescue funds ( the european stability mechanism and the single resolution mechanism ) are not even being contemplated .
along with inadequate capital supply , greece is suffering from a demand shortfall , as the troika continues to squeeze the country with harsh austerity .
if these policies are not relaxed or offset by more expansionary policies in the eurozone core , demand will remain depressed , discouraging further investment .
finally , on the reform front , time is running out .
for the last few years , rather than confronting the special interests – state-@@ protected businesses , public-sector trade unions , and lobbies – that inhibit reform , greece has spread its economic misery horizontally through blanket spending cuts .
reforms such as privatizing state-owned enterprises , opening up closed professions , abolishing restrictive business practices , and reducing the size of the public sector have been undertaken very slowly and inefficiently , and they will not significantly alter growth prospects .
as it stands , greece is unlikely to meet the recovery challenge – and other peripheral economies will probably falter , too .
sufficient reforms and capital are lacking , while the social rifts resulting from austerity increase the risk of potentially devastating political instability .
with the european parliament election approaching , the prospect of populist anti-austerity parties prevailing in the periphery – and of anti-euro , anti-bailout parties gaining power in the core – heightens the risk of instability even more .
should financial turbulence return and herald a new eurozone crisis , the monetary union ’ s sustainability will again be called into question .
to prevent this outcome , greece and the eurozone ’ s other peripheral economies must limit austerity , buttress demand , undertake reform , increase investment support , and pursue fiscal union .
unfortunately , these keys to ensuring a cohesive and prosperous eurozone are likely to be left unturned – until , perhaps , the next crisis occurs .

china ’ s real-estate wrongs
beijing – china ’ s real-estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years , with soaring property prices raising fears of overheating in the housing market .
but , with price growth easing , it seems that the government ’ s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold .
the danger now is that the housing market will collapse – bringing china ’ s economic prospects down with it .
in its effort to control rising housing prices , china ’ s government has pursued nine distinct policies , not all of which have served their purpose .
though policies like limits on mortgages for first-time buyers and minimum residency requirements for purchasing property in a first-tier city like beijing or shanghai helped to ease demand , supply-side tactics , such as limiting credit to real-estate developers and imposing new taxes on property sales , have proved to be counter-productive .
this flawed approach allowed china ’ s housing prices to continue to rise steadily , fueling major housing bubbles , especially in first-tier cities .
the average beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright .
in shanghai and guangzhou , the equivalent is 29 and 27 years , respectively – much higher than in other major international cities .
the expectation that this trend will continue has driven homeowners to retain possession of their properties , even though rental rates amount to less than 2 % of a property ’ s market value .
but , with the real-estate sector finally facing a downturn , the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived .
in the first four months of 2014 , housing sales dropped by nearly 7 % year on year , with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22 % .
as a result , downward pressure on property prices is mounting .
in normal times , citizens and officials alike would welcome this trend .
but , at a time of weakening economic performance , china cannot afford an implosion of the real-estate sector , which accounts for at least 30 % of overall growth .
indeed , though china ’ s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and rebalancing , the impact of a housing-market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit .
that impact partly reflects the highly problematic nature of the chinese government ’ s long-awaited move to liberalize interest rates .
instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish .
as a result , a large number of nonbank financial institutions – such as wealth-management companies and online financial-services providers – are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors .
making matters worse , the monetary authorities have tightened the credit supply , in an effort to deleverage the chinese economy .
while both interest-rate liberalization and deleveraging are critical to the long-term health of china ’ s economy , the skyrocketing cost of borrowing is forcing many low-risk companies , which are unable to offer sufficiently high rates of return , out of the market .
at the same time , real-estate developers who have borrowed heavily from shadow-banking institutions , based on the assumption that property prices would continue to rise steadily , may struggle to repay their debts , with a sharp decline in prices inevitably leading to defaults .
given that the formal banking sector provides a large share of shadow-banking finance , this could initiate a chain reaction affecting the entire financial sector .
many remain convinced that china ’ s government – which wields with the world ’ s largest foreign-exchange reserves and virtually unchecked authority – would be able to prevent a major financial crisis .
but the financial crisis in the fast-growing city of wenzhou , triggered by bad loans , suggests otherwise – not least because the economy has yet to recover fully .
there is no reason to believe that a similar crisis could not occur on a national scale .
to avoid such an outcome , china ’ s leaders must urgently adopt counter-cyclical measures .
they should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector , which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy , but also to people ’ s lives , with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment .
when it comes to the real-estate sector , china ’ s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy .
it is time to align intention with action .
otherwise , china ’ s financial sector – indeed , its entire economy – will suffer .

the revolution europe needs
strasbourg – the spontaneous street protests in paris over the past month come almost exactly 50 years after the mass revolt of may 1968 .
but that is not to say the two events are comparable .
les événements de mai 1968 was an anarchist uprising by students and workers against the traditionalism and apparent authoritarianism of president charles de gaulle .
today ’ s “ yellow vests , ” by contrast , have eschewed intellectual and political debate , and quickly degenerated into a rioting mob .
what started as a decent , middle-class protest against a new tax on diesel fuel has been hijacked by professional thugs and extremists railing against migrants , the european union , and french president emmanuel macron . “ paris is burning , ” glo@@ ated steve bannon , us president donald trump ’ s populist former consigliere , at a recent appearance alongside marine le pen of the far-right national rally ( formerly the national front ) .
according to bannon , “ the yellow vests … are exactly the same type of people who elected donald trump … and who voted for brexit . ”
worse still , the extremist activism has already spread to neighboring belgium and the netherlands , which now have yellow vest movements of their own .
and in italy , matteo salvini , the xenophobic interior minister , has capitalized on the riots to launch a broadside against macron ’ s policies . never mind that italy is in even more desperate need of a macron-style reform agenda than france .
the fact that alt-right agitators are using the yellow vest movement as a platform to spew hate and lies should worry all europeans .
in one way or another , many of today ’ s populist parties and movements draw financial support from the kremlin .
there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the united kingdom ’ s 2016 brexit referendum was influenced by “ dark money ” from russia .
and russian trolls have continued to foment islamophobic hatred across western europe .
the alt-right has been highly successful at exploiting people ’ s fears to undermine global solutions for global challenges such as migration and climate change .
for those struggling to make ends meet , right-wing messaging about refugees and migrants taking jobs and destroying european culture can resonate powerfully .
and for rural households facing slightly higher fuel taxes , it is convenient to believe that climate change is just a hoax propagated by political elites and “ the media . ”
a counter@@ movement against such disinformation is long past due .
the first step in stemming the populist , euroskeptic tide is to tell the truth and point out the lies .
but let us not be naive .
countering the alt-right threat to our societies will also require deep reform .
a common populist criticism of the eu is that it functions opaqu@@ ely and often incomprehensibly .
yet , if anything , the eu tends to be rather weak in the face of global challenges .
contrary to populists ’ claims of overreach , european institutions almost always do “ too little , too late . ” that must change , and radically so .
we need to make the eu far more democratic , transparent , and effective – which is to say , more sovereign – than it is today .
this does not require us to reinvent the wheel .
we need only return to the ideas of europe ’ s founding fathers : jean monnet , paul-henri spaak , robert schuman , alcide de gasperi , and others .
these leaders had a clear vision of a simpler yet stronger union , led not by a 28-member commission , but by a real government with 12 ministers .
they would have allowed europeans to vote directly for a parliament with full competencies and legislative authority , and without the system of unanimity that has allowed rogue member states such as hungary to tie the entire bloc ’ s hands .
above all , we must not equate liberal democracy with the status quo , which all but ensures slow , arduous decision-making .
if the eu suddenly were to make collective decisions by simple majority , the problems confronting it would no longer seem intractable .
europe would finally be able to stand on its own and address its citizens ’ concerns .
for example , with a european army serving as an autonomous pillar within nato , the eu would no longer have to defer to the us on security decisions .
with a single european digital market , european alternatives to google , facebook , amazon , samsung , and huawei could finally emerge .
and with a european border patrol and coast guard , europeans would be far less reliant on turkey , russia , and others when it comes to managing migration flows .
of course , controlling our borders does not mean closing ourselves off from the outside world .
europe will always need to engage with other powers .
but it must do so from a position of strength .
if the eu can rediscover its democratic potential , the alt-right will no longer have grounds on which to launch attacks against international cooperation and multilateralism .
in a more democratic europe , citizens who took to the streets would do so not to scapegoat migrants and journalists , but to demand solutions for the real challenges we face .
before it was co-opted , the yellow vest movement was based on a genuine concern about economic security .
the lesson for all eu member states is that we must shore up our national social-security systems , while moving forward on eu-level reforms .
with a full-fledged banking union , citizens ’ savings would be secured , and taxpayers would not end up on the hook for private-sector profligacy .
and with a complete monetary union and an autonomous joint budget , the eurozone would be far more resilient in the event of another financial crisis .
until europe gets serious about economic reforms , our economy will continue to underperform structurally vis-à-vis the rest of the world .
since 2010 , the average annual growth rate in the euro area has been 1.3 % , compared to 2.3 % in the united states .
this gap represents € 1.2 trillion ( $ 1.4 trillion ) from 2010-@@ 2018 , or approximately € 500 billion lost in terms of tax revenue .
for france alone , this amounts to € 10 billion every year – the budgetary cost of what macron recently proposed to meet the yellow vests ’ original demands .
the uprising that europe needs will not happen in the streets of paris or brussels , but within the eu ’ s paralyzed institutions .
for more than five decades , power within europe has been divided between conservatives and socialists who , collectively , have failed to address the challenges of the day .
it is time to leave the european talking shop behind us .
the current era demands action .
in the may 2019 european parliament election , “ generation europe ” can break the old political order and take the revolution out of the streets and into the hallways of european democracy .

will the yellow vests reject the brown shirts ?
paris – from the moment the french government canceled its planned fuel tax hike in the face of massive protests , it was obvious that the move would be perceived as inadequate , insignificant , and above all incapable of having any calming effect .
honor to whom honor is due : the yellow vests claim to be an expression of the sovereign people .
but they now bear a heavy responsibility .
for starters , they must announce a moratorium on demonstrations and blockades for a period long enough to accommodate the dialogue proposed by prime minister édouard philippe , if not longer .
in particular , they should renounce the much-touted december 8 “ act iv ” of the movement , brewing on facebook since saturday evening , which everyone expects to be more violent , destructive , and tragic than the preceding installments .
there have been enough deaths , injuries , and damage ( including to some of the most famous monuments in paris ) .
if the yellow vests decide the machine they have unleashed has overtaken them , and they can no longer stop act iv , they must be prepared during the protests to help the police flush out the violent “ brown vests ” who will be circulating among them .
because the wreckers of the far right and far left will surely reappear to vandalize , terrorize , and desecrate ; it is up to the yellow vests to say once again , this time as if they really mean it : not in our name .
whether the yellow vests declare a moratorium or continue to protest , nothing would serve their cause better than to dissociate themselves – decisively and unambiguously – from all the political profiteers who would capitalize on their misery .
the cast of opportunists is well known .
here is jean-luc mélenchon , who , having finished fourth in the 2017 presidential election won by emmanuel macron , is desperately seeking a new following .
there is françois ruffin , the leader of the anti-austerity movement nuit debout , with his irresponsible anti-@@ republican calls of “ resign , macron ! ” and over there is marine le pen , oscillating comically between taking pride in and repenting her call to occupy the champs élysées last saturday , thereby becoming accountable for the worst of what was said and done there .
and there the intellectuals who , in the manner of luc ferry and emmanuel todd , suggest that it was perhaps not “ by chance ” that the wreckers had such an easy time approaching , storming , and sacking the arc de triomphe .
such rhetoric lays the worst of all traps for a popular movement : the trap of conspiratorial thinking .
in other words , the yellow vests are at a crossroads .
either they will be bold enough to stop and take the time they need to get organized , following a path not unlike that of macron ’ s own la république en marche ! , which , in hindsight , might appear to be the yellow vests ’ first-@@ to-@@ arrive twin .
macron ’ s movement , too , had right and left wings .
and it knew that it was a new political body , engaging in a dialogue or even a showdown that would lead to an honest reckoning with poverty and the high cost of living .
if the yellow vests build a movement that rises to the height of macron ’ s , it may end up writing a page in the history of france .
or the yellow vests may turn out to lack that boldness and settle for the paltry pleasure of being seen on television .
they will allow themselves to become intoxicated by the sight of luminaries and experts of la france d ’ en haut ( elite france ) seeming to eat from their hands and hanging on their every word .
but if the yellow vests allow passionate hate to win out over genuine fraternity and choose wrecking over reforming , they will bring only chaos , not improvement , to the lives of humble and vulnerable people .
they will careen off into the darkest side of the political night , and end up in the dustbin of history , where they can rub elbows with those other yellows , the early-twentieth-century “ yellow socialists ” of the proto-fascist syndic@@ alist pierre biétry .
the yellow vests must choose : democratic re-invention , or an updated version of the national socialist leagues ; a will to repair , or the urge to destroy .
the decision will hinge on the historic essence of the movement – whether its reflexes are good or bad , and whether , in the final analysis , it possesses political and moral courage .
they have the initiative as much as macron does .
will they say , “ yes , we believe in republican democracy ? ”
and will they say it loud and clear , without equivocation ?
or will they place themselves in the tradition of paranoid nihilism and pollute their ranks with the political vandals that france still produces in abundance ?

paris – are the yellow vest protests across france as consequential as the mass rallies of may 1968 ?
the revolt has forced french president emmanuel macron to make significant and costly concessions , but it is hardly a new french revolution .
though some demonstrators clearly want to reenact the “ feats ” of their ancestors against their ( elected ) monarch , we are not in july 1789 .
the uprising of may 1968 , it is worth recalling , was driven largely by a bored generation of students living at the peak of france ’ s post-war prosperity .
though the economy was at full employment , they rebelled against the status quo in the name of dubious utopias inspired by fidel castro ’ s cuba and mao ’ s china .
they were joined by well-organized trade unions that helped the movement reach a critical mass , at least temporarily .
the difference between then and now is that those taking to the streets to protest against macron ’ s proposed fuel-tax increase are animated not by utopia but by despair .
in this sense , the yellow vest uprising is not unlike a french brexit , in that it amounts to an act of shooting oneself in the foot .
whereas the british resorted to the ballot box , the french have adopted a mixture of barricades , marches , and stone throwing .
in either case , everyone seems to lose out .
just as great britain ’ s break from the european union will leave both parties diminished , france ’ s domestic upheaval could undercut european integration .
under macron , france was supposed to keep the flame of liberal democracy alive in a world darkened by donald trump ’ s america , viktor orbán ’ s hungary , and matteo salvini ’ s italy .
with german chancellor angela merkel ’ s own leadership slipping , france looked like an island of hope in a sea of western despair .
that is clearly no longer the case .
one senses in british and american media coverage of the yellow vest protests a degree of schadenfreude .
the proud nation with the arrogant leader has been knocked down a peg ; it turns out that the french are no different from anyone else .
the yellow vest revolt has been driven in part by macron ’ s mistakes .
in pursuing radical but necessary reforms , he has been counting on stronger economic growth to vindicate him .
but growth has not materialized , and that makes an ecologically motivated fuel tax impossible for middle- and lower-@@ class french commuters to accept .
making matters worse , macron launched his reform agenda by slashing france ’ s wealth tax , a move that won him the sobriquet “ president of the rich . ”
yet , because macron had cut himself off from the country ’ s “ corps intermédiaires ” – including mayors , regional representatives , and trade unions – it took him far too long to see that the anger in france ’ s provinces , small towns , and rural areas was coming to a boil .
by surrounding himself with a court of bright young technocrats , macron lost contact with what he calls “ his people ” ( a rather tone-deaf formulation in itself ) .
this is a longstanding problem with the french meritocracy .
when i was teaching at the national school of administration in the 1980s , i saw the “ happy few ” who had passed the school ’ s highly selective entry exams being awarded their own cars and personal drivers .
imagine receiving this treatment as a 20-year-old intern in one of france ’ s prefec@@ tures .
no wonder they operate as if the state is at their service , rather than the other way around .
macron ’ s own personality may also have been a decisive factor in this first major crisis of his presidency .
macron is an exceptionally intelligent , energetic , and courageous person , but he seems to lack the maturity and humility that come with age .
he was so eager to restore to the french presidency the dignity that had been lost under his two predecessors – nicolas sarkozy and françois hollande – that he went too far in the opposite direction .
if you want to impress russian president vladimir putin or other foreign dignitaries , hosting them in such a magisterial setting as versailles is sure to prove effective .
but reveling in the country ’ s monarchical history can be dangerous .
many of those who voted for macron may have been hoping for a twenty-first-century bonaparte .
but now they may be thinking more of louis xvi , the king who paid with his life for the faults of his predecessors .
can macron learn from his mistakes and regain the confidence of french voters who have felt humiliated by him ?
it will not be easy , but it is not impossible .
at any rate , one should not write off prematurely a politician of such vision and ambition .
rather than rejoicing in a bold leader ’ s comeuppance , those who still believe in democracy should be thinking about what it would mean if macron fails .
italy ’ s present would become france ’ s future , and the populists who come to power in paris would probably put an end to the entire european project .
that is not an outcome anyone should wish for .
for better or worse , macron still represents european democracy ’ s best bulwark against a wave of populist nationalism .

yeltsin &apos;s last surprise
moscow : the hardest thing about power is knowing when to let go .
the next hardest , particularly in a country like russia which has experienced nothing but dictatorship for a millennium , is knowing whom to hand over power to .
in announcing his resignation on december 31 boris yeltsin may have succeeded on both counts , assuring not only his personal safety , but his place in history and russia &apos;s infant democracy .
yeltsin was more than the man who saved russia in 1991 when a coup by communist hard-liners threatened to turn back the clock by nullifying mikhail gorbachev &apos;s perestroika and glasnost .
in nine muddy years since then yeltsin also created a new russia , very much in his own image : one unpredictable , wayward , but full of promise .
by stepping down now , yeltsin has given his handpicked successor , acting president vladimir putin , the best chance to win elections that will take place this coming march .
shades of kremlin tsars and commissars of old ? as a deft manoeu@@ v@@ rer of the old school of communist politics , the gi@@ be is tempting to apply to yeltsin .
it is also unfair . with mandatory presidential elections next year , moscow was awash in rumours : “ feeding time at the zoo ” as one british prime minister called it .
by ending the whispering campaign that he intended to cling to power no matter what , president yeltsin deserves more cheers than je@@ ers .
through this orderly and constitutionally correct device to attempt to assure his succession , yeltsin may have put paid to any possibility of a chaotic power struggle in the kremlin without sacrificing democratic principles .
russia may now go on to complete its transition from communism to capitalism .
but what do we know of the heir apparent , vladimir putin ?
in keeping with his shadowy kgb background , very little .
putin is a married 46 year old , and a graduate of saint petersburg university &apos;s law faculty .
stationed for a decade as a kgb agent in the former east germany , he saw western democratic and business practices at close hand , and is believed to be committed to them .
after communism &apos;s collapse , he worked with people like an@@ ot@@ ol@@ y chubais in the liberal st. petersburg government of the early 1990s .
transferred to moscow , he headed the fsb ( the transformed kgb ) until yeltsin suddenly appointed him prime minister last august .
despite his murky profile , putin &apos;s most potent claim to fame – and to power – is a dour toughness .
in the bloody mountains and ruined cities of chechnya , putin established his credentials as the hard man russia needs to restore order and stop the country &apos;s internal disintegration by revitalizing state power .
with western economic policy prescriptions widely seen as having failed in russia ; with nato expanding near to the country &apos;s borders and old allies like serbia bombed ; with america seen as wanting to weaken russia even more , breaking it up into pieces and controlling the oil-rich caspian basin , anti-western sentiments are on the rise .
president putin &apos;s keen political anten@@ na has caught this trend .
so the fact that the west eyes russia &apos;s acting president with suspicion makes him even more desirable to the traditional russian heart .
vladimir putin , however , prefers to promote the impression of his being a more enlightened and modern leader .
his prime ministerial new year &apos;s address – &quot; russia at the turn of the millennium &quot; -- was posted on a russian government website for all the world to see before being published in russian newspapers .
in it he outlined his presidential program : playing to the crowds , he declared that russia is no plaything for the west to kick around .
but demagoguery stopped there . russia , he also declared , must mend itself .
it will remain cooperative and friendly with the world , provided that the world is cooperative and friendly too .
but the hard work of rebuilding russia must be done by russians , and with no time to waste .
in russia cultural instincts , in which communal ideas remain more valued than individualist principles , help determine the success or failure of policies .
the national strategies putin will likely follow will take into account these social impulses .
thus he is unlikely to publicly trumpet the unforgiving capitalist policies of gaidar and chubais , even if he quietly pursues them .
undoubtedly a strong patriot , putin also knows that russia &apos;s national idea of itself must be cleansed of haughtiness and imperial ambitions .
time and again he has said that russia &apos;s national idea must blend traditional russian concepts with a new , modern content .
the russia he envisions will be a great power once more , but great in the ways that a truly modern society must be : in its democratic commitments , its economy , and its domestic tranqui@@ lli@@ ty .
the consensus in russia today is that putin is a man of neither great talents nor great vices .
to ordinary russians he appears as modest , principled , and honest – a vast contrast with the tainted politicians of the yeltsin years .
he is a perfect fit for a russia grown tired of the heroes , revolutionaries , criminals – even savi@@ ours – who make life exciting but rarely stable .
a recent poll showed that what russia most wants is a new brezhnev , whose 20 years ( 1964-1982 ) of leadership first were disdained as an &quot; era of stagnation , &quot; but are now nostalgically recalled as the &quot; golden era of stagnation . &quot;
putin fits the desired mo@@ uld for a firmness and sto@@ li@@ dity that ensures stability , a strong state , and a &quot; golden middle &quot; between radical reforms and strong-arm rule .
in the back of their minds , however , russians also hold a secret fear about putin .
it concerns a man , a pleasant quiet individual who walks sound@@ lessly through the kremlin &apos;s corridors , someone who un@@ complain@@ ingly takes on ( and completes ) many hard and unpleasant tasks neglected by others who fight noisily for high position .
russians know that , one day , these unassuming political beasts of burden suddenly come out on top , as stalin did in the early 1920s .
so of president putin russia , like history , must still reserve its judgement .

did us drone strikes lose yemen ?
new york – recent revelations that the us killed an innocent american in a drone strike in pakistan confirm what a new study , “ death by drone , ” of civilian harm caused by us drone strikes in yemen shows – that claims about the precision of drone strikes are overstated .
the revelations also underscore the stark asymmetry between how the us treats drone strikes that kill its own citizens and those that kill others . while the obama administration has now publicly acknowledged that it has recently killed three us citizens in drone strikes , it has refused to acknowledge countless other drone strikes around the world which have killed non-us civilians .
in yemen , the us has been conducting drone strikes since at least 2002 , with estimates of the total number of strikes ranging from 91 to 203 .
while the american and yemeni governments have lauded the drones ’ precise targeting , they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes , including how many have been conducted , who has been targeted , or , crucially , the number and identities of civilians killed .
in a may 2013 speech at the national defense university , obama offered assurances that , outside the afghan war theater , no drone strike would be carried out unless there was “ near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured . ”
obama also claimed that the us targets only “ terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the american people , ” and that it does not launch drone strikes when it has “ the ability to capture individual terrorists . ”
“ death by drone , ” which includes first-hand testimony from eyewitnesses and survivors of drone strikes in yemen , tells a different story .
the nine case studies documented in the report , four of which cover attacks that came after the 2013 speech , provide credible evidence that us drone strikes have killed and injured yemeni civilians , suggesting that the “ near-certainty ” standard is not being effectively implemented .
the report also casts doubt on obama ’ s other claims , with evidence indicating that targets of drone strikes , though perhaps posing a threat to yemen , may not have posed a direct threat to the us , and that their capture may have been possible .
in other words , yemeni civilians have suffered and died from drone strikes that may not have been necessary .
more generally , the report provides a window into the experiences of yemeni civilians directly affected by us drone strikes .
the testimonies of these individuals , vital for assessing the us drone program , are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence , and because the strikes are conducted in secret , far away from the us .
as yaslem saeed bin ishaq , whose son was killed in a us drone strike in wadi sir on august 1 , 2013 , observed , “ they just kill .
they do not know what havoc their missiles have caused . they are unaware of the suffering they create for our families . ”
indeed , if the us never acknowledges the specific strikes , how can ordinary americans possibly know that ra@@ si@@ lah al-@@ fa@@ qi@@ h , a pregnant yemeni woman , was killed in wal@@ ad ra@@ bei ’ , along with her husband and ten-year-old daughter , as they headed home from a visit to the doctor ?
in every incident recorded in this report , the families of yemeni civilians killed in us strikes want to know why they were targeted .
as the father of nasser mohammed nasser , one of four innocent civilians killed in a us drone strike on april 19 , 2014 , lamented : “ my son and those who were with him had nothing to do with al qaeda . they were simply on their way to earn a living .
in february 2013 , then-@@ white house counterterrorism chief john brennan testified at his senate confirmation hearing to become cia director that , “ in the interest of transparency , ” the us must acknowledge mistaken killings publicly .
it should come as no surprise , then , that civilians like nasser , who have lost mothers , fathers , sons , and daughters in us strikes , are outraged not only at the us , but also at the yemeni government , which consented to the attacks .
they believe that instead of making yemen and the us safer , drone strikes only strengthen support for al qaeda .

can yemen be saved ?
sana &apos;a – yemen is no stranger to crisis .
exposed to a regional proxy war between iran and saudi arabia , plagued by an entrenched al qaeda affiliate , and divided by tribal disputes and a secession movement , the country has become a poster child for everything that can go wrong in the arab world .
yemen has demonstrated remarkable resiliency in the past .
to ensure that the recent overthrow of its government by the shia houthi rebel movement does not deal yemen the lethal blow that it has avoided so far , the international community must not abandon the country in what may be its hour of greatest need .
the origins of the houthi movement date to 1991 , when it was created to protect zay@@ dism , a moderate form of shi &apos;ism , from the encroachment of sunni islamists .
after the attacks on new york and washington , dc , on september 11 , 2001 , the group &apos;s battle took on a geopolitical dimension , as its fighters objected to yemen &apos;s decision to collaborate with the united states and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation .
from 2004 to 2010 , the group fought six wars against the yemeni government and even skirmished with saudi arabia .
yet it never managed to expand its reach beyond its stronghold in the north of the country .
that changed in 2011 , when the popular protests and political chaos stemming from the arab spring led to widespread institutional paralysis , allowing the houthis to march past a military that largely refused to fight it .
the group &apos;s power grab has frightened its adversaries , leading them to seek new alliances that could imperil the state &apos;s security .
in the central region of marib , home to the oil and gas facilities that yemen relies on for foreign currency , several tribes have vowed to fight the houthis .
the region was once a stronghold of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) , an affiliate of the global terrorist organization .
if the military refuses to assist the tribes – as is likely – they may be tempted to turn to aqap .
the situation is no less precarious in the southern provinces , where a secession movement has been active since 2007 .
southerners are up in arms because the houthi rebellion halted plans for the adoption of a federal system , which would have given the region greater autonomy .
in response , armed groups seized checkpoints and closed the port of aden .
the risk of secession is very real .
southern sunnis have been marginalized since a 1994 civil war that left northerners in control of most of the country &apos;s political institutions .
many in the region worry that the houthis will discriminate against them further .
aqap is firmly rooted in this region as well , implying the possibility that local residents will seek its help in defending against an expected houthi onslaught .
meanwhile , yemen continues to serve as a battleground in a proxy war between iran and saudi arabia .
iran has armed and trained the houthis , and , though the rebels &apos; brand of shi &apos;ism shares little with that practiced in tehran , they have praised the islamic republic &apos;s founder , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , and held up iran &apos;s lebanese proxy , hezbollah , as a model to be emulated .
when the houthis took over sana &apos;a , the capital , in september , saudi arabia cut off aid to the country .
to make matters worse , falling oil prices and attacks on pipelines imperil a hydrocarbon industry that provides 63 % of government revenues .
decreased earnings led yemen to forecast a $ 3.2 billion budget deficit last year .
if the turmoil is not curtailed and the saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country &apos;s ability to function , yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures .
the us has followed saudi arabia &apos;s lead , shuttering its embassy and freezing intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism operations .
this is a mistake .
yemen &apos;s military is largely intact , having remained in its barracks as the houthis marched to the capital , and there is little evidence that the units that work with the americans are loyal to the new rebel government .
suspending cooperation risks giving aqap free rein in a country where it was able to wreak havoc even when bridled .
yemen is mired in crises that it cannot solve alone .
unless its international allies throw it a lifeline , it risks being swallowed by a sea of disorder that could imperil the entire region .

yemen ’ s regime change gets personal
sanaa – when yemen ’ s president ali abdullah saleh ordered his military on march 18 to fire on peaceful protesters calling for his resignation , he sealed his fate .
a wave of military , government , and diplomatic defections , led by his long-time ally first armored brigade commander general ali muh@@ sin al-ahmar , rocked his regime .
but , although al-ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution , his decision was anything but altruistic .
the disgruntled general , who has long-standing ties to the type of jihadists that the united states is battling in yemen , merely sought to settle a score with the president ’ s family .
the relationship between al-ahmar and saleh extends to their youth , with saleh ’ s mother having had a second marriage to al-ahmar ’ s uncle .
though they are not half-@@ brothers , this frequent , if mistaken reference , indicates their closeness .
al-ahmar has long been considered either saleh ’ s right hand man or the country ’ s hidden president . when the nasserite party attempted to overthrow saleh less than 100 days into his presidency , al-ahmar defended him and quashed the coup .
in 1994 , his units put down a secessionist movement in the south .
but , as saleh prepared the way for his son ahmad – the head of the presidential guard – to succeed him , he began to marginalize al-ahmar .
in 2009 , saleh sacked al-ahmar ’ s key backers , including central command chief general al-thahiri al-shadadi and lieutenant general haydar al-sanhani , from power .
al-ahmar has also not benefited from the military aid that the us lavished on yemen in the wake of al-qaeda ’ s failed christmas day plot in 2009 to down an american airliner .
while the central security service , led by saleh ’ s nephew yahya , has received millions of dollars to fight al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula , al-ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza .
at the same time , al-ahmar ’ s dismal performance in spearheading the war against the houthi@@ -led sectarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient scapegoat for the regime ’ s failures .
the regime ’ s desire to get al-ahmar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting ag@@ inst the houthis in 2009-2010 , when saudi arabia began bombing the rebels .
according to a us diplomatic cable released by wikileaks , yemeni officials gave the saudis the coordinates for al-ahmar ’ s command center , telling them that it was a houthi camp .
his relationship with saleh frayed and his influence waning , al-ahmar understood that his loyalty to saleh had become a liability .
so his decision to abandon saleh stemmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son ahmad saleh , with whom he has long clashed .
their units skirmished during the houthi campaign , and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations .
saleh won at the time , but today al-ahmar ’ s troops have control .
al-ahmar ’ s relationship with jihadists is a source of serious concern .
he is married to the sister of tariq al-fadhli , a yemeni who fought alongside al-qaeda leader osama bin ladin in afghanistan .
when more than 4,000 arabs returned from fighting the soviets there , al-ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war .
one jihadist who trained in al-qaeda ’ s camps , and met bin ladin , told me that upon his return from afghanistan , he was invited to meet al-ahmar ’ s associates and was given a monthly stipend .
during a 1999 trial of yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 europeans , it emerged that the group ’ s ringleader called al-ahmar during the ordeal .
though his ties to jihadists may be expedient rather than ideological , they are deeply worrying .
today , saleh ’ s support among his top generals is dwindling .
of yemen ’ s four regional commanders , only southern command chief general mahdi maqwala still backs him .
lesser lieutenant generals have deserted the president in droves .
the fate of the country may not hinge on saleh , a crafty veteran who knows that his career is over .
but his son ahmad , who is less politically astute , may yet seek to settle accounts with al-ahmar .
his forces have already clashed with rival units in mukalla and surrounded the presidential palace in aden .
if the salehs retain control of the air force , which remains under the control of saleh ’ s half-brother , employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath .
nevertheless , the doomsday scenarios predicting anarchy and chaos in the post-saleh era are most likely exaggerated .
unlike in egypt , the vacuum resulting from saleh ’ s departure can be quickly filled , so the country need not fall back on a military oligarchy .
the yemeni opposition is not only organized , but also plays an active role in politics and has true grassroots support .
and , unlike in egypt , where the ruling party was detested and out of touch with the masses , yemen ’ s general people ’ s congress has some following in society .
if saleh leaves peacefully and represses the urge to unleash the last remaining loyal army units against protesters and defecting soldiers , the country can avert libya-@@ like mayhem .
indeed , the opposition parties have already organized a transitional council to take saleh ’ s place .
with the sun quickly setting on the saleh era , the president is out of options .

women ’ s development goals
new york – as the 2015 deadline for the united nations millennium development goals ( mdgs ) approaches , world leaders will face a choice : move the goal posts back another decade or two , or hold accountable those who have failed to deliver on their commitments .
for women , the choice is clear .
we have been here before .
in 1978 , at the international conference on primary health care in alma-ata , 134 states signed a declaration calling for adequate health care for all by the year 2000 .
sixteen years later , in 1994 , in cairo , 179 governments embraced reproductive rights as a basic human right and adopted resolutions to ensure the provision of universal access to a full range of reproductive health services , including family planning .
yet those deadlines had come and gone when , in september 2000 , during the 5@@ 5th un general assembly , leaders of 189 nations adopted the mdgs .
and several other commitments and resolutions were undertaken by world leaders before and after the mdg declaration .
so , where are we now ?
we know that several mdg targets have already been met . extreme poverty has been more than halved since 2000 , to about 22 % in 2010 – taking almost 700 million people out of the ranks of the world ’ s poorest .
we have seen positive results in the fight against hiv / aids , malaria , and tuberculosis .
billions of people have access to improved drinking water ; and many have gained access to sanitation ( though a billion people still have to resort to open defecation – a major health risk ) .
there has also been progress on gender equality .
girls and boys attend school in equal numbers , and women are increasingly making themselves heard in the political arena .
but the picture quickly becomes cloudy .
though chronic under-nutrition among young children has declined , one in four children – 162 million children , according to the world health organization – are still affected by stunting .
indeed , maternal and child mortality has decreased by millions , but many of these preventable deaths are still claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children each year .
moreover , the un foundation reports that 222 million women still cannot access the most basic information , products , and services that would enable them to decide how many children to have and to time their pregnancies in ways that preserve their health , enable them to pursue an education , and improve their lives .
the same report notes that more than 300,000 girls and women aged 15-19 die every year from pregnancy-related complications , while many more are left to deal with debilitating disabilities .
the un secretary-general ’ s 2013 report “ a life of dignity for all ” calls for a universal agenda to ensure that no one is left behind .
but millions of people – and particularly women – already are being left behind .
and , because world leaders and their development partners have failed to meet women ’ s basic reproductive-health needs once again , it will be more difficult to achieve concrete progress toward realizing the agenda for sustainable development .
the un ’ s own calls to accelerate momentum at the launch of the 500-@@ day countdown to the mdgs ’ expiry highlight the fact that inequality , maternal mortality from childbirth , lack of universal education , and environmental degradation remain serious challenges .
to truly affect change – and not only for women – we need global support for access to family planning , women ’ s and children ’ s health services , and support for empowerment initiatives .
an educated woman is better able to take care of herself , make informed choices , and broaden her contribution to her community .
no one disputes that development must be inclusive and equitable .
what is missing from the diplomatic discourse is a strong framework to hold governments and development partners accountable for translating lofty ideals like human rights – particularly the right to access basic health and social services – into practical solutions .
as the post-2015 sustainable development agenda is drafted , world leaders and their development partners need to think beyond setting new goals or targets that fade with time , and move toward establishing accountability mechanisms , processes , and systems to ensure that we meet the goals that we have already set .
we must break away from the current unwritten code of “ zero accountability ” for leaders who fail to honor their own commitments to internationally agreed goals .
in short , our governments must begin to do what they have promised .
without strong accountability mechanisms , ending preventable maternal deaths and fostering sustainable and equitable development will continue to elude us as we move into increasingly perilous times .

can ukraine be saved ?
kyiv – ac@@ rid black smoke hangs in the air and stings the eye in much of central kyiv , where state repression is dampening hope of resolving ukraine ’ s political crisis .
with a truce between the government and the opposition shattered only hours after it came into effect , and with dozens of people reported killed in recent days , any hope for an end to the country ’ s deepening civil disorder appears to be fading fast .
yes , a tentative settlement has been reached , following mediation by european union foreign ministers , with a promise of early elections .
but such settlements have been proposed before , and no agreement is likely to gain broad acceptance unless it includes the immediate departure of president viktor yanukovych .
in fact , yanukovych ’ s government seems prepared to use any and all measures to remain in power .
taking a page from russian president vladimir putin ’ s playbook , tax police are prosecuting civil-society organizations in the hope of cowing them into silence and irrelevance .
yet , despite such intimidation , ukrainians from all walks of life have been protesting for three months in cities across the country .
at its heart , this is a struggle between ukraine ’ s european-oriented west and its russian-@@ fixated east for the country ’ s geopolitical soul .
will ukraine move closer to the european union or instead join the russian-dominated eurasian union ?
despite the mounting violence , ukraine is not on the verge of civil war – at least not yet .
but make no mistake : the risk of the country – and its military – splintering is very real , as yanukovych ’ s decision to sack volodymyr zamana , the head of the armed forces , attests .
the conflict needs to be stopped now .
to achieve that , ukraine needs a transitional government of experts and a new constitution that returns the country to the system that prevailed until a decade ago , with power divided between parliament and the president .
moreover , a presidential election should be held within three months , with a new parliament voted in soon after .
but yanukovych has shown that he does not want a negotiated solution .
until the recent surge in violence , it seemed that dialogue might defuse tensions .
an amnesty for detained protesters was offered , and protesters agreed to withdraw from government buildings .
but when demonstrators fulfilled their promise and evacuated occupied buildings , yanukovych resorted to force in an effort to end the protests altogether .
indeed , the police began firing into crowds of demonstrators , and have reportedly killed at least 70 and injured hundreds more .
hospitals are overflowing , and many people are avoiding state clinics , because they are afraid of being detained – or worse .
the activist yuri verbitsky , a mathematical physicist , was abducted by five men in late january from a kyiv hospital , where he had gone to seek treatment after being injured by a stun grenade at a demonstration .
verbitsky ’ s battered body was found the next day in a forest outside the city .
any prospect for resolving the crisis ultimately depends on regaining citizens ’ trust in their police and security forces , which are now viewed by many as an occupying force .
to reestablish the public ’ s confidence , there can be no impunity for those who fired bullets or gave the orders to fire .
officials ’ excessive use of force , and the government ’ s reliance on semi-@@ criminal thugs ( known as titushki ) to attack protesters , must be thoroughly investigated .
but , even as the ongoing violence makes such an investigation all the more urgent , ukraine ’ s prosecutor and courts refuse to act .
that is why it is crucial that a high-level international mission – comprising civil-society leaders , the council of europe , and the european union – launch a comprehensive inquiry and pressure ukraine ’ s government to cooperate .
the eu and the united states have introduced diplomatic sanctions since the latest round of murderous violence began .
this should include a travel ban not only on all officials who ordered , oversaw , or implemented the crackdown , but also on yanukovych ’ s political enablers : the oligarchs who are now sitting on the sidelines while spiriting large sums of money out of the country .
sanctions should be lifted only when a credible investigation into the last three months of violence is permitted and a technocratic government is in place ( at which point the eu and its member states should offer concrete economic assistance ) .
prime minister mykola azarov resigned last month , ostensibly to make way for such a solution .
but yanukovych has refused to take the next step , or to commit to constitutional reforms , which largely explains the protesters ’ growing frustration – and their determination to press ahead in the face of brutal repression .
there is a perception in the west that all of ukraine ’ s political forces are weak , divided , and corrupt .
and there are growing concerns , often fueled by sensationalist media coverage , that far-right forces are gaining the upper hand within the opposition camp .
but , though such forces do exist , the vast majority of demonstrators on the maidans across the country are ordinary people angry about abuse of power , state violence , official impunity , and corruption .
for the venal and vicious elites who have taken control of ukraine , the real threat is these demonstrators ’ perseverance , not the provocations of a radical fringe .
indeed , while i refuse to believe that ukraine ’ s march to civil war is unstoppable , i also know that our citizens will never be silenced again .

filling the global leadership vacuum
seoul – has the world entered a new era of chaos ?
america ’ s vacillating policy toward syria certainly suggests so .
indeed , the bitter legacy of the invasions of iraq and afghanistan , followed by the 2008 financial crisis , has made the united states not only reluctant to use its military might , even when “ red lines ” are crossed , but also seemingly unwilling to bear any serious burden to maintain its global leadership position .
but , if america is no longer willing to lead , who will take its place ?
china ’ s leaders have demonstrated their lack of interest in active global leadership by openly rejecting calls to become a “ responsible stakeholder ” in the international political and economic systems .
meanwhile , though russia may wish to maintain the illusion that it is a global power , it lately seems interested primarily in thwarting america whenever possible – even when doing so is not in its own long-term interests .
and europe faces too many internal problems to assume any significant leadership role in global affairs .
unsurprisingly , this dearth of leadership has seriously undermined the effectiveness of international institutions , exemplified by the united nations security council ’ s ineffectual response to the syria crisis and the failure of the current round of world trade organization ( wto ) trade negotiations .
this situation resembles the 1930 ’ s – a decade when , as the economic historian charles p. kindleberger argued , a leadership vacuum led to the under-@@ production of global public goods , deepening the great depression .
in these circumstances , the us and china – the only viable candidates for global leadership – must achieve a grand compromise that reconciles their fundamental interests , in turn enabling them to act in concert to provide and protect global public goods .
only by stabilizing the bilateral sino-american relationship can a global system that supports peace and shared prosperity be achieved .
such a compromise should begin with a concerted effort by the us to enhance china ’ s role in international economic institutions like the international monetary fund , the world bank , and the wto .
while the appointment of the chinese central banker zhu min as imf deputy managing director was a positive step , it has not been followed by other appointments or steps that would increase china ’ s influence .
moreover , china should be included in the trans-pacific partnership – the pan-asian free-trade area that the us is now negotiating with australia , brunei darussalam , chile , malaysia , new zealand , peru , singapore , and vietnam .
dividing the asia-pacific region into two economic blocs – one centered around china and the other around the us – will increase mistrust and encourage economic friction .
in fact , as former us national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski argued at the world peace forum in beijing in june , what the world really needs is a comprehensive economic partnership between the us and china .
but such cooperation will be impossible unless the us recognizes china as an equal partner – and not just rhetorically .
given that the us retains a significant military advantage over china , america could support such a partnership without incurring significant security risks .
the irony is that military superiority could weaken us leaders ’ willingness to make the kinds of concessions , particularly with regard to security matters , that an equal partnership would require .
but , even then , the needed adjustments could be made without compromising us security interests .
consider us arms sales to taiwan .
given the degree of china-taiwan cooperation nowadays , reducing such sales would be unlikely to endanger taiwan , and doing so would contribute substantially to confidence-building between the us and china .
the question is whether any us president , republican or democrat , would be willing to risk alienating those who still view taiwan through the lens of its conflict with the people ’ s republic .
the quid quo pro for these changes to us policy would be a commitment by china to respect and defend a set of international norms , principles , and institutions that was created largely without its involvement .
given that china ’ s rapid gdp growth since 1979 would have been impossible without america ’ s efforts to create an open world order , chinese leaders should not consider this too difficult a pill to swallow .
to be sure , china ’ s increasingly assertive foreign policy since 2009 could indicate that , despite the universal advantages that a sino-american leadership condominium would bring , its leaders will remain unwilling to commit to enforcing the existing global order .
but the growing sense that this new assertiveness has backfired , increasing anxiety among china ’ s neighbors and compelling the us to ramp up its strategic involvement in asia , means that china could probably be convinced to reset its relationship with the us .
the major test here will be whether china is willing to accept the status quo in the east and south china seas .
doomsayers frequently cite the wars that followed imperial germany ’ s rise as a historical parallel to the sino-american relationship today .
but a better example – in which a global hegemon accommodates an emerging power – might be the united kingdom ’ s acceptance of america ’ s rise .
as china ’ s leaders define the country ’ s global role , they should bear in mind the success of the uk ’ s approach – as well as the failure of imperial germany ’ s arrogant diplomacy .

the politics of young and old
paris – if one considers some of today ’ s main challenges – including climate change , pensions , public debt , and the labor market – an obvious conclusion emerges : it is relatively much worse to be young today than it was a quarter-century ago .
yet in most countries , the generational dimension is remarkably absent from the political debate .
fifty years ago , people spoke often , and loudly , of a “ generation gap . ”
today , that gap has become invisible .
this is bad for the young , for democracy , and for social justice .
start with climate change . its containment requires changing habits and investing in emission reductions so that future generations will have a habitable planet .
the alarm bell was first rung in 1992 at the earth summit in rio de janeiro ; but over the last generation , little was done to contain emissions .
and progress following the landmark agreement achieved in paris in december is unlikely to be fast , because the accord is premised on postponing major efforts .
universal assent was made possible only by further delaying .
given the massive inertia inherent in the greenhouse effect , the gap between responsible and irresponsible behavior will start resulting in different temperatures only in a quarter-century , and major consequences will follow only in 50 years .
anyone older than 60 today will hardly notice the difference between the two scenarios .
but the fate of most citizens currently younger than 30 will be fundamentally affected .
in due course , the respite gained by the older generations will have to be paid for by the younger ones .
now consider debt . since 1990 , public debt has increased by about 40 percentage points of gdp in the european union and the united states ( and much more in japan ) .
given near-zero interest rates , the corresponding drag on income is currently low ; but , because inflation is virtually inexistent and growth is anemic , the debt ratios have only stabilized .
so debt reduction will take longer than expected in the aftermath of the global crisis , which will deprive the coming generations of the fiscal space they might need to invest in climate action or in the containment of security threats .
future pensions represent another form of debt .
the pay-as-you-go ( payg ) systems in place in many countries are giant intergenerational transfer schemes .
true , everyone is expected to contribute while they work , before becoming a recipient in retirement .
in an ideal steady state , pension regimes would not redistribute income across cohorts born at different points in time .
as specialists say , they would be generationally neutral .
but the baby boomers ( those born from the mid-@@ 1940s to the mid-@@ 1960s ) paid little into the payg schemes because economic growth , population size , and their parents ’ low life expectancy made financing pensions easy .
all these factors have now gone into reverse : growth has slowed , the baby boomers are a demographic bulge weighing on their children , and they are expected to live long .
countries where pension reforms were introduced early have been able to limit the resulting burden on the young and keep the balance between generations approximately fair .
but countries where reforms were delayed have allowed that balance to place the young at a disadvantage .
finally , consider the labor market . over the last decade , conditions for new entrants have worsened markedly in many countries .
the number of young people categorized as ne@@ et ( neither in employment nor in education or training ) currently stands at 10.2 million in the us and 14 million in the eu .
in continental europe , especially , young workers are the first to suffer from economic downturns .
on all of these issues – climate , debt , pensions , and jobs – the younger generations have been made relatively worse off by developments over the last quarter-century .
a telling symbol is that there is often more poverty among the young than among the elderly .
this ought to be a major political issue , with significant implications for public finances , social protection , tax policy , and labor market regulation .
and it reinforces the imperative of reviving growth through productivity-boosting policies .
yet the new generation gap has had little direct political effect .
it hardly arises in electoral debate and has generally not led to the emergence of new parties or movements .
instead , the generational divide shows up in electoral participation .
in the latest us mid-term elections , the turnout rate among younger citizens was less than 20 % , compared to more than 50 % for senior voters .
similar trends are observable in other countries .
despite the increased uncertainty they face , younger citizens are much more disengaged from electoral politics than their parents and grandparents were at the same age .
this generational gap in electoral participation explains why politicians care more about the elderly than about the young .
but in aging societies , the more the young abstain from voting , the more decisions by parliaments and governments will be biased against their interests .
true , parents are generally not selfish .
they help their children through private transfers and grants .
but only those with income and wealth can provide meaningful support .
the result of neglecting young people collectively while supporting them privately is social inequality on a massive scale .
how to redress generational biases in the political system is a key question for all democracies .
solutions do exist : mandatory voting , term limits for elected officials , and youth parliaments or special bodies to examine intergenerational issues , for example .
but such measures are either difficult to implement or only moderately effective in view of the magnitude of the challenges .
what is unclear is when and how young people will recognize that and make themselves heard .

your genes or mine , how different are we ?
for some time , scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9 % genetically identical . the 0.1 % of the genome that was different ( approximately 3,00@@ 0,000 bases of dna ) was comprised of “ single nucleotide polymorphisms ” ( snps are alterations of the individual bases of dna ) scattered throughout the genome .
it was thought that some of these dna alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different , but otherwise normal individuals .
in the summer of 2004 , two groups of scientists working independently ( one led by researchers at harvard medical school and brigham and women ’ s hospital in boston and the other led by researchers at cold spring harbor laboratories ) called this scientific dogma into question .
their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular dna segment varied from individual to individual .
with only a few exceptions , all dna segments were thought to exist in two copies ( one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father ) .
both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies .
this alerted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood , and forced us to speculate on the implications of this discovery .
this discovery was made recently because until now , the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome-wide fashion .
that has changed over the last five or six years , with the development of a technique known as “ arra@@ y-based comparative genomic hybridization ” ( array-cgh ) , revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics .
about three years ago at brigham and women ’ s hospital , when we were seeking a potential tool for high-resolution diagnostics , array-cgh offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genome-wide test that could detect gains or losses in an unbiased and non-@@ subjective fashion .
when validation experiments were performed that compared the dna from one “ normal , healthy ” individual with the dna from another “ normal , healthy ” individual , we were astonished to find an average of 12 dna fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared .
these became known as copy number variants , or cnvs .
combining the data from our study and the study from cold spring harbor laboratories , over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit cnvs among normal individuals .
since these two initial studies , many other groups , including ours , have confirmed and documented many more cnvs in other individuals studied .
this is the goal of the structural genomic variation consortium ’ s copy number variation project , which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characterization of cnvs in humans .
the consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in africa , asia or europe ( known as the hap@@ map collection ) to construct a new map of the human genome .
using two complementary genome-wide technologies , with subsequent validation studies , a total of 1,4@@ 47 cnvs were identified .
the data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought .
many of the regions in which the cnvs were identified overlapped known disease genes .
since they are being identified in normal individuals , cnvs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease , but many may confer susceptibility to certain diseases , serve as disease markers , and / or indicate potential regions of genomic instability .
some cnvs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and detoxi@@ fic@@ ation-related metabolism ( some of the human body ’ s reactions to the environment that we live in ) .
indeed , some cnvs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications .
hopefully , a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation ( i.e. single base pair changes and structural genomic variation , such as cnvs ) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individualized manner , that would result in maximum therapeutic effects to each patient , with minimal side effects .
overall , we anticipate that many of these cnvs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever-changing environment .
indeed , as studies continue to identify and characterize cnvs , we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations , complex diseases , and human adaptability .

un@@ burdening the facebook generation
los angeles – once again , young people have gotten the short end of the political stick .
the outcome of the united kingdom ’ s brexit referendum is but another reminder of a yawning generational divide that cuts across political affiliation , income levels , and race .
almost 75 % of uk voters aged 18-24 voted to “ remain ” in the european union , only to have “ leave ” imposed on them by older voters .
and this is just one of several ways in which millennials ’ economic future , and that of their children , is being determined by others .
i am in my late fifties , and i worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered – to our shame and chagrin – as the one that lost the economic plot .
in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis , we feasted on leverage , feeling increasingly entitled to use credit to live beyond our means and to assume too much speculative financial risk .
we stopped investing in genuine engines of growth , letting our infrastructure decay , our education system lag , and our worker training and retooling programs erode .
we allowed the budget to be taken hostage by special interests , which has resulted in a fragmentation of the tax system that , no surprise , has imparted yet another unfair anti-growth bias to the economic system .
and we witnessed a dramatic worsening in inequality , not just of income and wealth , but also of opportunity .
the 2008 crisis should have been our economic wake-up call .
it wasn ’ t .
rather than using the crisis to catalyze change , we essentially rolled over and went back to doing more of the same .
we swapped an over-leveraged banking system for experimental liquidity injections by hyperactive monetary authorities .
in the process , we overburdened central banks , risking their credibility and political autonomy , as well as future financial stability .
emerging from the crisis , we shifted private liabilities from banks ’ balance sheets to taxpayers , including future ones , yet we failed to fix fully the bailed-out financial sector .
we let inequality worsen , and stood by as too many young people in europe languished in joblessness , risking a scary transition from unemployment to un@@ employability .
in short , we didn ’ t do nearly enough to reinvigorate the engines of sustainable inclusive growth , thereby also weakening potential output and threatening future economic performance .
and we are compounding these serial miscarriages with a grand failure to act on longer-term sustainability , particularly when it comes to the planet and social cohesion .
poor economics has naturally spilled over into messy politics , as growing segments of the population have lost trust in the political establishment , business elites , and expert opinion .
the resulting political fragmentation , including the rise of fringe and anti-establishment movements , has made it even harder to devise more appropriate economic-policy responses .
to add insult to injury , we are now permitting a regulatory backlash against technological innovations that disrupt entrenched and inefficient industries , and that provide people with greater control over their lives and wellbeing .
growing restrictions on companies such as airbnb and uber hit the young particularly hard , both as producers and as consumers .
if we do not change course soon , subsequent generations will confront self-reinforcing economic , financial , and political tendencies that burden them with too little growth , too much debt , artificially inflated asset prices , and alarming levels of inequality and partisan political polarization .
fortunately , we are aware of the mounting problem , worried about its consequences , and have a good sense of how to bring about the much-needed pivot .
given the role of technological innovation , much of which is youth-led , even a small reorientation of policies could have a meaningful and rapid impact on the economy . through a more comprehensive policy approach , we could turn a vicious cycle of economic stagnation , social immobility , and market volatility into a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth , genuine financial stability , and greater political coherence .
what is needed , in particular , is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms , better demand management , addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness , and improving regional and global policy frameworks .
while highly desirable , such changes will materialize only if greater constructive pressure is placed on politicians .
simply put , few politicians will champion changes that promise longer-term benefits but often come with short-term disruptions . and the older voters who back them will resist any meaningful erosion of their entitlements – even turning , when they perceive a threat to their interests , to populist politicians and dangerously simplistic solutions such as brexit .
sadly , young people have been overly complacent when it comes to political participation , notably on matters that directly affect their wellbeing and that of their children .
yes , almost three-quarters of young voters backed the uk ’ s “ remain ” campaign .
but only a third of them turned out .
in contrast , the participation rate for those over 65 was more than 80 % .
undoubtedly , the absence of young people at the polls left the decision in the hands of older people , whose preferences and motivations differ , even if innocently .
millennials have impressively gained a greater say in how they communicate , travel , source and disseminate information , pool their resources , interact with businesses , and much else .
now they must seek a greater say in electing their political representatives and in holding them accountable .
if they don ’ t , my generation will – mostly inadvertently – continue to borrow excessively from their future .

yukos now , russia &apos;s economy later
just as familiarity breeds contempt , success often spawns complacency .
sadly , that seems to be the case in russia , where the government has chosen the first period of prolonged economic growth since communism &apos;s fall@@ --with the budget in surplus and capital flight seemingly reversed--@@ to re-open the oligarch wars of the 1990 &apos;s .
optimists beware : the arrest of mikhail khodorkov@@ sky-@@ -and the freezing of his shares in oil giant yuko@@ s--@@ will have a profound long-term impact on russia &apos;s economy and on relations between business and government .
the yukos imbroglio will not bring russia &apos;s economy to a screeching halt , because no single company determines the country &apos;s fate . but long-term prospects are certain to deteriorate .
&quot; operation clean hands &quot; --@@ what some are calling the investigations into khodorkovsky and his associ@@ ates--@@ will not increase tax revenue , but only spur growth in the informal economy , as businessmen try to conceal their affairs even more completely from the government .
after all , once russia &apos;s richest man can be stripped of his assets at any moment , ordinary russian businessmen may be forgiven for concluding that operating in the open is risky .
the first signs of this realization will probably take the form of an increase in capital flight .
until the yukos affair , capital flight was reversing .
after a decade of hemorrhaging capital , the first half of this year saw data indicating that russians who had taken their money out of the country were bringing it back to invest at home .
if capital flight resumes , it will quickly snowball if president putin fails to convince people that the yukos affair is an isolated case .
i believe that capital flight will increase substantially .
reduced business activity , with long-term investment projects being cancelled , seems just as certain .
a lower rate of economic growth thus seems inevitable .
independent russian economic experts are unanimous in sharing this grim conclusion .
only people linked to the regime appear to differ .
if investment stalls , president putin will have no hope of doubling the size of the economy within a decade , as he has promised .
my longstanding skepticism about this promise has now hardened into certainty : the yukos affair will make it impossible to sustain the growth rate required to achieve this goal because the arrest of mikhail khodorkovsky and the seizure of his assets has dealt a devastating blow to business confidence .
indeed , times have changed dramatically since the cutthroat russian capitalism of the 1990 &apos;s--@@ supposedly a world in which entrepreneurs were indifferent , at best , to each other &apos;s problems .
that caricature , if ever true , is certainly not true today : the business community &apos;s negative reaction to the persecution of khodorkovsky by the law enforcement agencies has been strong and nearly unanimous .
the growing calls of some state officials to deal with economic crime are viewed by the business community as both a mockery of the legal code and a veiled threat that the prosecutors want their cut of russia &apos;s riches .
the improved image of russia &apos;s legal system is in tatters .
today , the business community understands that the prosecutor general &apos;s office can find any pretext to go after any one of them .
if prosecutors can treat huge businesses so roughly , what hope is there for medium and small businesses ?
no surprise , then , that owners of companies of all sizes are now forming a united front to protect their interests .
president putin , meanwhile , steadfastly refuses to discuss the yukos affair or the actions of the law enforcement agencies with russia &apos;s business community .
his silence clearly implies consent to the actions of the prosecutors .
but if the president will not publicly account for the fidelity of russia &apos;s law enforcement agencies to law , who will ?
one of the great flaws of putin &apos;s presidency has been to allow law enforcement agencies to evaluate their own actions .
of course , they invariably conclude that their actions were right and lawful .
so the president &apos;s position is clear and he will not back down .
in fact , only businesspeople may now be able to influence events : a sharp and pronounced slowdown , with russian capital showing its displeasure by voting with its feet , might be the last hope for turning the prosecutors from their chosen course .
but i see no reason for optimism .
on the contrary , the arrest of khodorkovsky has only whetted the prosecutors &apos; appetite .
once they have digested yukos , they will look for another meal .
after that , can anyone seriously doubt that the craving for fresh prey will intensify ?

a prisoner ’ s reflections on nelson mandela
kharkiv – incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability .
but the truth of life for a political prisoner , even for one on a hunger strike , is the opposite .
as a prisoner , i have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself , my political beliefs , and my country .
so i can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men , old and young , who have gathered in kyiv and other ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and european future .
in prison , your hopes and dreams become your reality .
i am sure that nelson mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed .
the south african apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades , but in the great soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality , courageous young south africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence .
around the world , most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which mandela led south africa out of the political wilderness .
even here , behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long , i can conjure the warmth of his broad smile , merry eyes , and those colorful hawaii@@ an-style shirts that he wore with such panache .
and i can admire his unyielding – and , yes , sometimes wily – commitment to reconciliation , which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-@@ minority rule saw as inevitable .
how wrong they were , and how miraculous was mandela ’ s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid south africa .
no purges marked the end of white rule .
there were no witch-hunts , nor was there summary justice .
all that mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed .
through the unique innovation of the truth and reconciliation commission , mandela found the only viable bridge between his country ’ s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess .
mandela was able to guide south africa to freedom , because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison .
indeed , he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture .
imprisonment brought aleksandr solzhenitsyn this clarity as well . “ gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states , nor between classes , nor between political parties , either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts , ” he wrote in the gulag archipelago .
“ this line shifts … .and even within hearts overwhelmed by evil , one small bridge@@ head of good is retained .
and even in the best of all hearts , there remains ... an un-@@ uprooted small corner of evil . ”
the ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow .
forced to reckon with your own vulnerability , isolation , and losses ( and seemingly lost cause ) , you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your jailers .
mandela epitomized this rare gift .
how else could he have personally invited one of his robben island jailers to attend his inauguration as south africa ’ s first democratically elected president ?
of course , behind mandela ’ s generous spirit was a character of steel .
he bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause .
and he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family .
and yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people .

sweet caroline in tokyo
but jfk ’ s eldest daughter , caroline kennedy , was not present at either event ; she had just taken up her post in tokyo as the 29th us ambassador to japan .
on november 19 , thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of kennedy as she made her way from tokyo station to the imperial palace , around a kilometer away , by horse-drawn carriage to present her credentials to the emperor .
waving to the onlookers , she looked like snow white .
november 22 , 1963 , was also the day satellite broadcasting from the united states to japan began , and many japanese got up early to watch a speech by jfk in dallas that began at 5 : 30 a.m .
but , rather than airing the speech , the broadcast brought the shocking news of the assassination .
the image of young caroline – the inspiration for neil diamond ’ s famous song – solemnly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he saluted his father ’ s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of japan ’ s people .
so there probably is not a single japanese who would not welcome her as us ambassador .
us ambassadors to japan have come in three types . there have been academic experts on japan , like the acclaimed scholar edwin reischauer .
there have also been political heavyweights , such as michael mansfield , a long-time democratic majority leader of the us senate , former vice president walter mondale , former speaker of the house of representatives thomas foley , and senator howard baker , who also served as president ronald reagan ’ s chief of staff .
the third type are presidential political appointees , such as thomas schieffer , a former business partner of president george w. bush , and john roos , a noted silicon valley lawyer .
clearly , caroline kennedy , an important early supporter of president barack obama , is in this category .
indeed , her backing for obama in the democratic party primaries in 2008 , when he was still a relatively unknown senator from illinois , gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family ’ s legacy .
kennedy ’ s address to the senate foreign relations committee during her confirmation hearing elicited bipartisan support – a rare occurrence nowadays , given america ’ s highly polarized national politics – and she received unanimous approval .
although she lacks formal political or diplomatic experience , her personal connections , particularly to obama , will have great significance for us-japan relations .
and there are pressing issues that need the new ambassador ’ s attention .
for example , there are security questions related to strengthening the alliance between japan and the us , including the relocation of the futenma air station , the base of operations for the us marine corps on okinawa .
there are also issues related to economic cooperation , such as the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) , the proposed mega-regional free-trade treaty covering pacific rim economies .
although powerful domestic interest groups , particularly those representing the agricultural sector , have objected to japanese participation in the tpp negotiations , prime minister shinzo abe ’ s government chose to join the talks late in the day .
instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him , he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected , but that will help to transform myriad aspects of japan ’ s economy .
of course , given today ’ s hyper-partisan environment in the us , there is a danger that fast-track negotiating authority – under which congress binds itself to an up-or-down vote on trade agreements ( thereby precluding amendments and filibusters ) – will not be given to the president .
if this roadblock cannot be overcome and the agreement stalls , the abe government ’ s approval ratings will suffer , despite progress in the negotiations .
given the unanimity with which kennedy was confirmed , she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast-track authority in congress .
the abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the tpp , but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of deflation and strengthen japan ’ s national-security posture , which has been hamstrung for decades .
given the nexus of issues that tie vital us interests to japan ’ s reform process , kennedy , with her character and skills , could well prove to be an essential link between the countries at a crucial point in their relationship .

who lost thailand ?
tokyo – thailand , southeast asia ’ s most developed and sophisticated economy , is teetering on the edge of the political abyss .
yet most of the rest of asia appears to be averting its eyes from the country ’ s ongoing and increasingly anarchic unrest .
that indifference is not only foolish ; it is dangerous .
asia ’ s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the united states faced when mao zedong marched into beijing , and again when ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ousted the shah in iran .
who , they will have to ask , lost thailand ?
much of the world is wondering how such a successful economy could allow its politics to spin out of control .
what accounts for the armies of protesters – distinguished , gang-@@ like , by the color of their shirts – whose mutual antipathy often borders on nihilistic rage ?
the roots of the current unrest extend back more than a decade , to former prime minister thaksin shinawatra ’ s first electoral victory in 2001 .
thaksin ’ s triumph did not represent the normal alternation in power that one finds in a democracy .
instead , his victory heralded the political rise of the country ’ s poor , long-@@ silenced rural majority .
bangkok ’ s entrenched elite recoiled in alarm .
but , instead of learning to compete with thaksin for the votes of thailand ’ s rural poor , the country ’ s urban elite ( including the powerful military ) sought to delegitimize his rule .
when he was re-elected by an even larger majority , his government was overthrown , his political party was banned by the supreme court , and he was forced to flee the country after corruption charges against him led to a criminal conviction .
yet thaksin ’ s supporters did not abandon him .
when thailand ’ s military returned to their barracks , many thai citizens voted for thaksin at one remove , with his sister – yingluck shinawatra , a long-time executive at thaksin ’ s communications firm – becoming prime minister , supported by a powerful parliamentary majority .
for much of her term in office , yingluck garnered praise for her pragmatism , and for seeking to ameliorate the antagonism of her opponents .
but that praise and success appears to have bred a form of hubris .
she proposed an amnesty law that would have not only pardoned opposition leaders , including abhisit vejjajiva , her predecessor as prime minister ( who faces murder charges ) , but allowed her brother to return to the country .
and , in defiance of a supreme court ruling , she sought a constitutional amendment that would make the senate , whose members are appointed , an elected body .
the opposition , sensing that its moment had arrived , launched a wave of street protests .
yingluck , in an effort to defuse the situation , called for a parliamentary election in february .
but the opposition has rejected this and says that it will boycott the vote .
it fears – rightly , most people suspect – that the thaksin camp will be returned to power in any free and fair vote .
so , in essence , what is happening in thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country ’ s entrenched elite .
unable to compete successfully with thaksin for votes , they now want to dilute thai democracy in order to prevent the electorate from ever again choosing a government that goes against their will .
if thailand were an insignificant country with little geostrategic weight , its problems might not matter as much as they do to the rest of asia .
but thailand is southeast asia ’ s lynchpin economy .
it is a key partner for myanmar ( burma ) as it makes its own political and economic transition , and it is a hub for trade with neighboring cambodia , laos , and vietnam .
but the biggest reason that thailand matters for asia ’ s democracies is fierce competition for influence between a rising china and the democratic world .
its military is mostly trained by the united states ; indeed , it was the key staging point for the us during the vietnam war .
likewise , japan and india have long regarded thailand as a democratic bulwark in a neighborhood where some regimes – cambodia and laos – are firmly under china ’ s hegemonic sway .
indeed , its government has proved to be a strong supporter of myanmar ’ s president , thein sein , as he seeks to free his country from china ’ s tight embrace .
by standing aside as thailand ’ s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country ’ s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule , asia ’ s democracies risk driving some elements of the thaksin camp into the arms of china , which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force .
but this need not happen .
thailand ’ s military has long and respectful ties not only with the us military , but with officers in japan as well .
thailand ’ s opposition politicians , many of whom were educated at top western universities , may also be open to quiet advice that they are pushing things too far , not only putting thailand ’ s stability at risk , but also jeopardizing regional security .
just as , a decade ago , the west objected to the efforts of turkey ’ s entrenched secular elite to rob recep tayyip erdoğan ’ s mildly islamist akp party of its democratic victory , it needs to speak clearly today in defense of thai democracy .
the opposition ’ s claim that it is acting in the interests of the world ’ s democracies needs to be rebutted .
thaksin may be no saint , and some constitutional reform will be needed if political reconciliation is to come about .
but thaksin ’ s governments , like that of his sister , have kept china at one remove from influence .
that is the key strategic interest that is now at stake .
should yingluck be ousted in a coup , or should the country ’ s democracy be hollowed out to preclude her return to power , the shinawatras may be left with no choice but to seek support from thailand ’ s giant neighbor to the north .
if that happens , we will all know who lost thailand .
we did .

equality or estrangement
tokyo – those whom the gods would destroy , they grant their wishes .
will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the united states and japan ?
for a half-century , the us , which wrote japan ’ s postwar “ peace ” constitution , has pressed the japanese to play a greater role in maintaining asian and global stability .
but now that japan finally has a leader who agrees , the us is getting nervous , with secretary of state john kerry supposedly calling japan under prime minister shinzo abe “ unpredictable . ”
these strains in the us-japan relationship – surely the foundation stone of asian stability – first became noticeable in december , when abe visited the yasukuni shrine in tokyo , which houses the “ souls ” of ( among others ) class a war criminals from the pacific war .
the us has always criticized japanese officials ’ visits to the shrine , but through diplomatic channels .
this time , america voiced its displeasure openly .
the us is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pilgrimages on japan ’ s relations with its neighbors , particularly china and south korea .
but the harsh tone publicly adopted by president barack obama ’ s administration raised serious concerns among some in abe ’ s government who question obama ’ s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of america ’ s defense commitment .
such suspicions were sharpened after china declared its new air defense identification zone , which overlaps japanese sovereign territory .
the us tried to have it both ways : though the obama administration sent us bombers through the new adiz to demonstrate its refusal to recognize china ’ s move , it also told us commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the chinese authorities .
likewise , us acquiescence in china ’ s de facto ouster of the philippines from the scarborough shoal ( a disputed out@@ cropping in the south china sea ) raised questions in japan about the two countries ’ supposed harmony of interests .
in fact , although the us extols the virtues of its partnership with japan , successive american presidents have been vague about the details .
ultimately , the idea always seemed to be that japan would pay more for defense , but the us would set the partnership ’ s objectives .
abe ’ s conception of the us-japan partnership presupposes much greater equality .
after all , a society like japan , trying to escape two decades of economic malaise , cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national-security strategy , even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the us .
far from being based on chest-thumping nationalism , abe ’ s national-security strategy reflects , above all , a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the japanese .
his bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-confident japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape .
strangely , it is all but forgotten – particularly by the chinese – that for two decades japan has watched china ’ s rise quietly from the sidelines ( even supportively , to the extent that japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since deng xiaoping opened the economy ) .
indeed , abe has succeeded so well in returning japan to the world stage that his us and asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate japanese self-confidence – a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago .
but the fact remains that one of abe ’ s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied japan ’ s long economic stagnation . those who see in his patriotic rhetoric a desire to whitewash history miss his real concern : economic revival is meaningless if it does not secure japan ’ s position as a leading asian power .
the us , however , regards abe ’ s worries about japan ’ s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with china and overhaul its strategic presence in the pacific .
for example , the us views the trans-pacific partnership – the huge trade agreement involving it , japan , and 10 other leading pacific rim countries – as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade .
but , for abe , the tpp ’ s value for japan ’ s sense of identity – that it is now a more outward-looking nation – is just as important .
in abe ’ s view , japan needs to regain , wherever possible , the right of independent decision-making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by china . this does not mean that abe ’ s japan will become an ally like france under jacques chirac , spurning us leadership for the sake of it ; instead , abe seeks a policy of cooperation with the us that reflects the alliance &apos;s voluntary nature .
he believes that , given the new balance of power in asia , the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice , and the wherewithal , to act autonomously or with regional allies .
fortunately , japanese and american analyses of chinese trends are not very different .
both generally view china as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach .
and both believe that only when china is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for asia take place .
but even here , there is a difference .
the us , convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy , believes that once china recognizes the limits to its power , a structure of peace will follow naturally .
abe , by contrast , believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon , and he is determined that japan play its part in constructing that balance .
although abe has lifted japan ’ s sights and self-confidence , he recognizes that japan faces real limits . the us , too , should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally .

securing japan
tokyo – shinzo abe ’ s second term as japan ’ s prime minister began with a laser-@@ like focus on economic revitalization .
that policy , almost instantly dubbed “ abenomics , ” comprises what have been called the three “ arrows ” : bold monetary policy , an expansionary fiscal stance , and structural reforms to stimulate private investment .
hosting the olympic games in tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this quiver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the games .
to be sure , after 15 years of deflationary recession , revitalization of the japanese economy remains far from complete .
nonetheless , the effects of abe ’ s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates .
but abe also confronts a security environment in asia that is every bit as brittle as japan ’ s economy was before his government took office last december .
indeed , he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago .
his efforts back then were halted by his own resignation , and he is now making a second attempt to establish a national-security governance system to meet japan ’ s needs – and those of its allies – in twenty-first-century asia .
in a speech to a plenary session of the lower house of japan ’ s diet on october 25 , abe emphasized that , given the current security situation in asia , “ it is essential to strengthen command functions for implementing the prime minister ’ s national security policy . ”
now that split control of the diet ’ s upper and lower houses has been resolved , with abe ’ s liberal democrats in strong control of both chambers , a bill to modernize japan ’ s national-security governance is certain to pass .
the bill that abe has submitted aims to establish a japanese national security council , based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries , such as the nsc in the united states .
the security council of japan – something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis – will now be reorganized as a formal institution .
the new nsc ’ s membership will be limited to the prime minister , the cabinet secretary , and the foreign and defense ministers , with relevant ministers added on an ad hoc basis .
a permanent national security secretariat , headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience , will be established in the prime minister ’ s office , with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy .
this strategy will then be reflected in guidelines issued to japan ’ s defense bodies and diplomats .
japan , like other countries , has faced jurisdictional disputes among foreign-policy , defense , and police agencies that have hindered the aggregation and analysis of intelligence information .
but , with the creation of the nsc , each ministry and agency will report important national-security information to the new secretariat , which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others .
of course , as in other countries , bureaucracies are creatures of habit . as we can already see , it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated ministries and agencies .
institutionalization will take time – and the importance of its success cannot be understated .
for example , the new nsc will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries , including the us , japan ’ s most important ally .
as a result , ensuring the protection of information will be a key issue , particularly given the old habit of leaking security information to the press .
that is why the diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose harsher punishment on government officials who leak secrets , particularly those concerning national security .
the trauma of gag laws that were imposed on the press before and during world war ii resulted in the elimination of all restraints afterwards , which had the effect of making japan a spy ’ s paradise , with insufficient counterintelligence measures and poor secrecy .
moreover , the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confidentiality .
for example , japanese newspapers always report when , where , and with whom the prime minister met for dinner in the following day ’ s editions .
in contrast to the us system of presidential government , japan has a parliamentary form of government .
yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems – indeed , one of british prime minister david cameron ’ s first acts when he came to power was to establish an nsc to improve coordination of policymaking .
although the establishment of the japanese nsc is long overdue , it is not too late for japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring .

how to end an insurgency
tokyo – when the moro islamic liberation front guerrilla movement took up arms in the philippines in the 1960 ’ s , ferdinand marcos had yet to become the country &apos;s president – let alone dictator .
despite the country ’ s many political transformations in the last half-century , the milf ’ s campaign to achieve independence for the bangsamoro nation – whose territory , they claim , covers the islands of mindanao , palawan , sulu , and sabah – remained constant , until president benigno aquino iii resolved to change it .
the milf was not deterred by the popular overthrow of marcos ’ s 20-year dictatorship in 1986 , following the assassination of the opposition leader benigno aquino , jr .
nor did the establishment of democracy – now deeply entrenched – inspire the group ’ s leaders to reconsider their approach .
the milf remained engaged in a brutal campaign of beheadings , assassination , kidnappings , and indiscriminate butchery .
then , last january , aquino managed to achieve a landmark deal that finally ended mindanao ’ s agony .
this is one of the most remarkable feats of peacemaking in asia since world war ii , and at least as worthy of international recognition as former finnish president and 2008 nobel peace prize laureate marti ahtissari ’ s role in brokering peace in aceh , indonesia , in 2005 .
in fact , given the myriad security and political risks that aquino ran in concluding a peace deal with the milf , he may be an even worthier nobel laureate .
aquino ’ s approach to the negotiations reflected his recognition that the milf had twice used peace talks – once brokered by libya ’ s colonel muammar el-qaddafi – as a cynical ploy to buy time to regroup and raise funds ( including from al qaeda ) .
with freshly re@@ stocked arsenals , they would relaunch their campaign to seize mindanao by force .
against this background , it is no surprise that , when aquino relaunched stalled peace talks in 2012 , the filipino people were highly skeptical .
but , over time , the effort gained credibility .
though questions about the peace agreement ’ s durability remain , with full disarmament yet to take place , the political autonomy granted to the country ’ s muslim areas seems to have persuaded most milf fighters that the time has come to end the carnage .
for the people of mindanao , this is a life-changing development .
in the few short months since the peace deal was reached , filipino and foreign investment has been flowing into the island .
with nearly half of mindanao ’ s population living below the poverty line , these funds could not be more critical .
but the benefits of aquino ’ s leadership are not limited to mindanao .
his entire presidency , which began in 2010 , has been characterized by the creativity and dog@@ gedness that made peace with the milf possible .
whereas other filipino leaders – including aquino ’ s mother , corazon aquino , who was elected president after marcos ’ s overthrow – spoke out against corruption , aquino has attacked it at its roots .
he has brought to justice not only small-time wrongdoers – or “ flies , ” as chinese president xi jinping ’ s calls such people – but also “ tigers ” like senator juan ponce enrile , who helped overthrow marcos and bring corazon aquino to power two decades ago .
as a result , the philippines has dramatically improved its ranking in transparency international ’ s annual corruption index , rising from a 13@@ 4@@ th-@@ place tie with nigeria in 2010 , to 9@@ 4th place , alongside india , last year .
aquino ’ s efforts to fight corruption and rebuild his country ’ s economic foundations has enabled the philippines – at long last – to become southeast asia ’ s fastest-growing economy , with annual gdp growth of 7.2 % last year .
while growth is expected to slow slightly this year , to 6.5 % , the philippines can now be counted among asia ’ s “ tiger ” economies .
of course , the country still has a long way to go .
some ten million filipinos – one-quarter of the workforce ­ – ­ are compelled to seek employment overseas , owing to inadequate opportunities at home .
if the philippines is to attract enough investment to achieve living standards comparable to malaysia and thailand , aquino must remain persistent in his efforts to open the economy and curtail corruption .
fortunately , he seems determined to do so .
nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to china ’ s territorial claims in the south china sea .
aquino ’ s stern criticism of china ’ s expansionist policies has certainly not endeared him to the chinese .
but regional powers like the united states and japan have supported his stance , with japan promising to deliver enhanced equipment for the philippine coast guard .
and the filipino people undoubtedly appreciate his tenacity in protecting their interests .
aquino ’ s success in bringing the decades-old milf rebellion to a peaceful end highlights a courage and tenacity that will enable him to play a key role in reining in china ’ s regional ambitions .
just as david ’ s ingenuity enabled him , against all odds , to defeat goliath , aquino ’ s bold and calculated leadership can succeed in bolstering stability and security throughout asia by bringing china , perhaps against its will , into a rules-based regional order .

japan ’ s russian dilemma
tokyo – for japanese leaders and citizens , president vladimir putin ’ s brutal annexation of crimea was an unsurprising return to the normal paradigm of russian history .
indeed , most japanese regard the move as having been determined by some expansionist gene in russia ’ s political dna , rather than by putin himself or the specifics of the ukraine crisis .
japan is particularly concerned with russian expansionism , because it is the only g-7 country that currently has a territorial dispute with russia , which has occupied its northern territories since the waning days of world war ii .
that occupation began between august 28 and september 5 , 1945 , when the soviet union hurriedly nullified the existing soviet-@@ japanese neutrality treaty and invaded not only japanese-occupied manchuria , but also southern sakhalin island and the ancient japanese territories of etorofu island , kunashiri island , shikotan island , and the habomai islands .
concerned that america ’ s development and use of atomic weapons against japan would deprive the soviet union of any territorial gains in the east , stalin ordered the red army to invade .
but japan , having already endured the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki , had accepted the potsdam declaration on august 14 , meaning that the war was already over when the red army marched in .
since then , these islands have been controlled by either the soviet union or its successor state , russia .
and , as elsewhere in russia , their residents have been impoverished by consistently incompetent and corrupt government , whether run by communists or today ’ s crony capitalists .
in a strange historical twist , given the crimean annexation , after the japanese citizens native to the northern territories were killed or expelled , many ukrainians were brought to the islands during the soviet years , and still live there .
if an independence referendum were to be held on etorofu island , where some 60 % of the inhabitants have roots in ukraine , i wonder whether putin would accept the result as readily as he did the ballot in crimea , undertaken at the barrel of a gun ?
after coming to power at the end of 2012 , japanese prime minister shinzo abe had sought to improve relations with putin in the hope of beginning serious talks on the northern territories .
but now that putin has made his project of imperial restoration crystal clear , those hopes are stillborn .
recognizing this , abe condemned the annexation of crimea , calling it “ a violation of ukraine ’ s integrity and the integrity of its sovereignty and territory . ”
abe added that “ attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be overlooked , ” and that japan would consider further economic sanctions against russia in cooperation with the g-7 .
needless to say , these remarks underscored the fact that japanese territory and territorial waters are being threatened “ by force ” in the east china sea by china .
the lesson now being drawn is that , where territorial disputes are concerned , japan must not kowtow to “ attempts to change the status quo backed by force . ”
china ’ s response to the crisis in ukraine was particularly revealing .
for three decades , china has proclaimed “ non-interference ” in the internal affairs of sovereign states as the most important rule governing international relations .
but when putin invaded ukraine , china showed the hollowness of its adherence to this principle .
instead of condemning russia for invading and annexing crimea , it abstained at the united nations security council , and has offered more criticism of ukraine ’ s new popular government than it has of putin ’ s thuggish behavior .
every country in asia is bound to draw only one conclusion from china ’ s tacit approval of putin ’ s crimean land grab : china , too , thinks that might makes right , and if it believes that it can get away with invading disputed territories , whether in the south china sea or in the indian himalayas , it will do so .
as a result , effective deterrence will require asian countries to strengthen their defenses and unite to demand adherence to international law , so that china understands that any putin-style land grabs will cost its economy dearly .
in the immediate future , japan will work with the g-7 to ensure that putin ’ s reckless ambitions do not endanger other parts of ukraine .
already , japan has decided to provide ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) in economic aid for ukraine , the largest pledge by any individual country , including the us , thus far .
before the crimea invasion , territorial negotiations between japan and russia showed signs of progress .
moreover , several bilateral economic cooperation efforts , such as projects involving liquefied natural gas , were moving forward .
but it is now clear not only that putin is returning russia to the stagnation of the late-@@ soviet era , but also that he subscribes to former soviet leader leonid brezhnev ’ s dictum that “ what we have , we hold . ”
so putin ’ s talk about reaching an agreement with japan on the northern territories was likely as mendacious as his claims that russians in crimea were in peril , and thus in need of protection by russian troops .
more important , japan understands that business as usual with an aggressive russia that undermines the international order could embolden others closer to home to embrace putin ’ s lawless tactics .
the days of an inward looking japan are over .
japan now sees threats elsewhere in the world in the context of its own security , and will react appropriately .

abenomics ’ women problem
tokyo – when japanese prime minister shinzo abe addressed the united nations general assembly last week , he emphasized his determination to build a society in which women shine .
indeed , creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pillar of the government ’ s reform program , so-called “ abenomics . ”
abe is clearly on the right track .
according to an analysis by researchers at goldman sachs , closing the gender gap could boost gdp by 9 % in the united states and nearly 13 % in japan .
during his stay in new york , abe also discussed “ womenomics ” with hillary clinton , who had made empowering women in the economy a key policy goal during her tenure as us secretary of state .
abe , strange to say , is the first japanese leader to grasp that the underutilization of women ’ s skills has been holding back japan ’ s economy .
japan ranked 105th out of 136 countries in the world economic forum ’ s “ global gender gap report 2013 , ” down from 101st place in 2012 .
the problem begins in abe ’ s own domain – politics .
in his cabinet reshuffle earlier this month , five female ministers were appointed , but in the face of strong opposition from male mps .
more important , the appointments amounted to painting over the cracks : only 39 of the 480 members of the japanese diet ’ s lower house , or 7.9 % , are women .
the inter-parliamentary union ranks japan 15@@ 8th out of 189 countries in terms of its ratio of female mps .
things are just as bad at lower levels of government , where women account for a mere 13.1 % of representatives in local parliaments , more than 40 % of which have no female members at all .
as the leader of the liberal democratic party , abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next april ’ s local elections .
but , at least so far , abe seems to lack the will to do so ( though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring in more women ) .
it is also worrying that some of the women abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch-conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children .
given this , one cannot help feeling uncertain about the credibility of his womenomics initiatives .
that is especially true when one considers the lack of women in corporate management positions .
everyone at the meeting of the keidanren , the federation of economic organizations , to welcome us ambassador caroline kennedy were men in dark suits .
in 2003 , norway revised its corporation law to state that companies that failed to place women in 40 % of management positions could face delisting .
if the same law were applied to japan today , every company would be deli@@ sted .
women currently hold an estimated 9 % of senior management positions in japan , compared to 40 % in the philippines , 24 % in france , and 22 % in the united states .
one reason that japan ’ s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions , despite their varied experiences .
when akira matsumoto became ceo of the japanese snack manufacturer calbee , he began appointing both female executives and foreigners to the company ’ s leadership .
revenues and earnings have increased , and net sales have grown threefold .
though there is no proof that the former caused the latter , matsumoto ’ s commitment to lead in this area suggests that corporate dynamism may well increase with a more prominent role for women .
likewise , daiwa securities ceo shigeharu suzuki has appointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities , with promising results .
although the employment rate of women in japan reached 6@@ 9.5 % in 2013 , more than 60 % of women leave the workplace prematurely , mostly owing to childbirth .
this pattern results from institutional impediments to achieving a viable work-family balance – impediments that embody the harsh view of male superiors and colleagues toward working mothers .
changing this view is not easy , because the confucian belief that women belong in the home remains embedded in japanese and some other asian societies .
moreover , most of the people participating in forums or workshops focused on womenomics are women ; too often , these events simply turn into platforms for women to complain among themselves .
abe ’ s womenomics will not work unless and until japanese men change their thinking .
if abenomics is now stalling , as many fear , the reason may be found in a lack of capacity to implement the policies put forward , particularly with respect to women .
indeed , the key to abenomics ’ success or failure may turn out to be whether the japanese people are convinced that women are essential to their country ’ s economic revival , and are willing to support an earnest effort to establish institutions that support working women .

tipping points to asia ’ s future
tokyo – a week , it is said , is a long time in politics .
but events in asia over the past week may define the region for decades to come .
thailand , one of asia ’ s most prosperous countries , seems determined to render itself a basket case .
a military coup , imposed following the thai constitutional court ’ s ouster of an elected government on spurious legal grounds , can lead only to an artificial peace .
unless thailand ’ s military is prepared to serve as a truly honest broker between deposed prime minister yingluck shinawatra ( and her supporters ) and the anti-democratic bangkok elite , which has sought a right to permanent minority rule , today ’ s calm may give way to a new and more dangerous storm .
to thailand ’ s east , vietnam is the latest asian country to feel pinched by china ’ s policy of creating facts on the ground , or in this case at sea , to enhance its sovereignty claims on disputed territory .
vietnam ’ s government reacted vigorously to china ’ s placement of a huge , exploratory oilrig near the disputed paracel islands in the south china sea .
ordinary vietnamese , taking matters into their own hands , reacted even more vigorously , by rioting and targeting chinese industrial investments for attack .
china ’ s unilateral behavior has exposed a strain of virulent anti-chinese sentiment bubbling beneath the surface in many asian countries .
renewed protests over china ’ s mining investments in myanmar this week confirmed this trend , one that china ’ s leaders seem either to dismiss as trivial , or to regard as somehow unrelated to their bullying .
indeed , like russian president vladimir putin , who faces widespread public antipathy in ukraine , china ’ s leaders appear to believe that popular protests against them can only be the product of an american plot .
yet , despite their shared contempt for expressions of the popular will , china ’ s president xi jinping and putin struggled , during putin ’ s two-day visit to shanghai , to agree on a new gas deal that the kremlin desperately needs .
putin had viewed china as his backup option should the west seek to isolate russia following its annexation of crimea .
putin ’ s idea was that he could pivot russia ’ s economy into a partnership with china .
but xi balked , signing the gas agreement only after putin offered a steep , long-term discount .
xi ’ s self-confidence reflected not only the chinese leadership ’ s contempt for putin ’ s mismanagement of the russian economy , but also the fact that china ’ s energy worries have lessened considerably of late .
successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing ( “ fracking ” ) technology in xinjiang suggests that china , like america , will soon be able to draw on its own reserves of shale energy .
moreover , plentiful gas supplies from myanmar and central asia will provide china with sufficient supplies of energy for at least a decade .
china ’ s hard bargaining with russia has exposed the limits of the two countries ’ bilateral cooperation , which has important geo-strategic consequences for asia and the world .
china , it now seems , is happy to see putin poke his finger in the west ’ s eye and challenge america ’ s global leadership .
but it is not willing to underwrite with hard cash russian pretensions to world power status .
instead , china appears interested in turning russia into the sort of vassal state that putin is seeking to create in ukraine .
but the most epochal events of the last week took place in two of asia ’ s great democracies : india and japan .
narendra modi ’ s landslide victory in india ’ s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller , but may well mark a decisive break with india ’ s traditional inward-looking policies .
modi is determined to reform india ’ s economy and lead the country into the front rank of world powers .
here , modi will find no staun@@ cher ally than japanese prime minister shinzo abe , who was among the first asian leaders to embrace him in his bid to lead india .
given that both countries have almost perfectly aligned regional security interests , there should be plenty of scope for the two to act in tandem to improve regional security and mutual prosperity .
thailand ’ s crisis might well mark a good early test of their ability to work together , because both countries have strong interests in thailand ’ s rapid return to democracy and the credibility needed to act as an honest broker in ending the country ’ s crisis .
in the past week , abe created for himself considerably more political space to act as a strategic partner , not only to india , but also to japan ’ s other allies , particularly the united states .
quietly , a panel appointed by abe ’ s government this week offered a reinterpretation of a key element of article 9 of japan ’ s constitution .
for the first time since the pacific war ’ s end in 1945 , japan ’ s self-defense forces would be able to participate in “ collective self-defense ” – meaning that japan could come to the aid of its allies should they come under attack .
of course , china and others in asia have tried to muddy this change with the alarmist charge of a return to japanese militarism .
but the new interpretation of article 9 augurs just the opposite : it embeds japan ’ s military within an alliance system that has been , and will remain , the backbone of asia ’ s prevailing structure of peace .
abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in singapore at this year ’ s shangri la dialogue , the annual meeting of asian military and civilian military leaders .
modi ’ s victory and abe ’ s increased ability to stand by japan ’ s allies can help to forge deeper bilateral ties and , if properly understood by china , foster a greater strategic equilibrium in the region .
it is now possible for asia ’ s greatest powers – china , india , japan , and the us – to form something akin to the concert system that gave europe a century of almost complete peace in the nineteenth century .
of course , such a system would require china to set aside its goal of regional hegemony .
clear-sighted chinese must already see that , short of a victorious war , such dominance is impossible .
now is the moment for china to anchor its rise within a stable and mutually acceptable asian regional order .
indeed , for china , this may be the ultimate tipping point in its modernization .

the road to slov@@ y@@ ansk
tokyo – the ukraine crisis has demonstrated that one person alone can endanger world peace .
but that one person might not be russian president vladimir putin , who in reality only leads a large regional power that , owing to his authoritarian rule and muddled economics , is a long-term threat more to itself than to the world .
no , the lone actor most responsible for threatening world peace might unwittingly be us president barack obama , with his scholarly inertia and apparent disregard for the fate of smaller , faraway countries .
of course , obama is not responsible for russia ’ s invasion and annexation of crimea , or for putin ’ s massing of russian troops on ukraine ’ s eastern border in an effort to intimidate the government in kyiv .
nor is obama alone in crafting a western policy of appeasement by default .
german chancellor angela merkel also bears considerable responsibility : her tough rhetoric masks a largely business-as-usual approach that reflects her country ’ s dependence on russian gas supplies .
but obama is responsible for his administration ’ s apparent indifference to the fate of the american-built order that has governed world affairs since the end of world war ii .
unless he tough@@ ens his policies , the rules and norms that have guaranteed peace for so many for so long could lose their force .
the utter disconnect between america ’ s diplomatic principles and practice has become so great that it is emboldening the country ’ s adversaries .
that is why , following russia ’ s illegal seizure and annexation of crimea , putin is now trying to mold ukraine ’ s eastern provinces into vassal regions , if not foment irredentism , in order to realize his dream of reconstituting the russian empire .
the united states ’ closest allies are also watching nervously , and the conclusions they appear to be drawing could harm its national security interests severely in the years and decades to come .
consider the middle east , where saudi arabia is already openly questioning the reliability of the kingdom ’ s historic us defense guarantee . and us secretary of state john kerry ’ s “ guidance ” for a settlement of the israeli-palestinian conflict , which should have been unveiled this month , will now remain under wraps .
speculation abounded that kerry ’ s proposal would contain a specific us guarantee of israel ’ s borders .
but can anyone imagine israelis taking america at its word after watching the us dither while russia redrew the map of ukraine ?
in the budapest memorandum of 1994 , the us , together with the united kingdom and russia , guaranteed ukraine ’ s territorial integrity in exchange for its surrender of the large nuclear arsenal it inherited from the soviet union .
now that the us has disregarded its obligation to ukraine – reportedly unwilling even to share intelligence with its government on russian troop movements , much less supply the country with the means to defend itself – all bets are off concerning an american guarantee of israel ’ s security and territorial integrity .
for that matter , why should iran discontinue its nuclear program when it sees the ease with which ukraine was dismembered ?
after all , the iranians have borne far harsher sanctions than those imposed on russia so far .
by acquiescing in russia ’ s seizure of crimea , the us may also see core alliances begin to unravel .
for example , the us has openly stated that it will defend japan should china forcibly seize the disputed senkaku islands . but if america can evade its guarantee of ukraine ’ s territorial integrity , why should japan ’ s leaders believe that it will do otherwise in the case of a far-flung cluster of uninhabited islands that are scarcely more than rocks inhabited by sheep ?
us secretary of defense chuck hagel heard an earful of official doubt about the credibility of america ’ s defense commitment during his recent visit to japan .
obama is certain to hear more of the same in tokyo this week .
of course , the us is no longer in a position to “ pay any price … to secure the survival and the success of liberty , ” as john f. kennedy put it in his inaugural address – not in ukraine , and not anywhere else .
the huge price of its wars in afghanistan and iraq has understandably made the us war-weary .
moreover , no country has the right to expect americans to fight and die on its territory for its freedom .
but has the us become so withdrawn from the world that it is willing to pay only a symbolic price , such as that implied by russia ’ s tit-for-tat sanctions , to stop aggression that threatens the international order ?
have america ’ s recent foreign wars so scarred its leaders that they are unable to defend the world order that their predecessors created and for which many americans have died ?
the time is growing short for the us to demonstrate anew – to friend and foe alike – that its word remains its bond .
unless russia honors the accord recently reached in geneva to defuse the ukraine crisis , the us must use – and soon – its full arsenal of non-military means to demonstrate to putin the costs , and folly , of his 1930 ’ s-style revanchism .
the soft underbelly of putin ’ s imperial ambitions is russia ’ s brittle and undiversified economy , and the expectations of ordinary russians for improved living standards .
the us and the european union need to demonstrate clearly to the russian people that their president ’ s policies will mean a likely return to the poverty and tyranny of the soviet era .
any lesser display of resolve may fatally weaken the bedrock of western security – and that of the world .

the pyongyang purge
tokyo – during the cold war , the term “ kremlin@@ ology ” referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the soviet union – indeed , behind the entire iron curtain . kremlinologists monitored ( in whatever way possible ) who was up and who was down among the core soviet leadership .
great significance was read into who signed an official document , or who stood where atop lenin ’ s tomb in red square when reviewing military parades .
all of that was gram@@ mar-@@ school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in north korea , where the truth is far more opaque .
consider what happened on december 17 .
choe ryong-hae , vice chairman of the central military commission of the korean workers ’ party , was conspicuously present on stage at the commemoration of the second anniversary of “ dear leader ” kim jong-il ’ s death – the first major ceremony following the purge and execution of jang song-thaek , the former vice chairman of the national defense commission .
choe ’ s speech , with its threats against the united states and south korea , seemed to set the stage for his political elevation .
jang song-thaek had been seen as a kind of regent to kim jong-un , the young successor to the kim family dynasty , and was thought to be number two in the regime .
but he owed his position to his wife , kim kyong-hui , the only sister of kim jong-il , kim jong-un ’ s deceased father .
jang ’ s tact , as well as his usefulness as an interlocutor with china , enabled him to keep his position , despite his long-term separation from his wife .
but in north korea , blood is paramount : everything , including ideology and the national interest , is subservient to the maintenance of the kim dynasty .
the “ legacy ” of the “ great leader ” kim il-sung and his son , “ dear leader ” kim jong-il , determines all major decisions .
i have long believed that the true holder of power since kim jong-il ’ s death has been his sister , kim kyong-hui , and no one else .
north korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership , but it appears that she was the only family member whom kim jong-il could trust .
when he was incapacitated by illness , it was she who called the shots .
her blood tie to the kim dynasty is the reason why , even after her husband was purged and executed ( and the rest of his family rounded up ) , she maintained her political position .
it has even been suggested that she made the decision to purge her husband .
though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him , it is not surprising that she believed that , with her own health failing , she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband ’ s care .
perhaps the most chilling aspect of jang ’ s execution is that it appears to be part of a feeding frenzy that has claimed the lives of a number of senior officials and generals .
and the bloodletting has been extremely personal : in august , kim jong-un reportedly ordered the execution by firing squad of an ex-@@ girlfriend and other members of her musical ensemble ; the killings are said to have been carried out in front of their families .
elsewhere in the communist world , such murderous purges were renounced long ago , first in the soviet union by khrushchev , following his denunciation of stalin , and then in china by deng xiaoping , following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970 ’ s .
this “ reform ” did not make these regimes any more beneficent or efficient , but it did bring a degree of stability and predictability to their behavior .
north korea , always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states , remains in a twilight world .
more disturbing is the question of whether china is going down a parallel path under president xi jinping .
ever since deng ’ s rule , there has been an understanding that members of the chinese communist party ’ s politburo are not to be touched , even in retirement .
but xi , under the pretext of his anti-corruption battle , has targeted retired politburo member zhou yongkang , who is now reportedly under house arrest , facing graft charges – and lurid allegations not only that he murdered his first wife but that he tried to assassinate xi .
china ’ s emphasis since deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic , but it at least prevented the re-emergence of a new cult of personality à la mao zedong .
the question today is whether xi ’ s flouting of this internal party convention is another step in re-creating one-man – and thus completely arbitrary – rule in china .
in north korea , of course , arbitrary rule – no matter how bizarre and inept – is always the norm .
and now , with jang purged , responsibility for economic failure in north korea has been shifted to choe .
all officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the executioner , for he is certain to bear the blame when the dynasty needs a scapegoat for its mounting problems .
and jang ’ s purge may make those problems worse .
while china lost a convenient point of contact with the kim regime , north korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself .
the economy cannot be revived so long as international sanctions are maintained , and the sanctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brinkmanship .
china , which has been the kim dynasty ’ s lifeline , no longer appears willing to offer it a blank check .
so the day is fast approaching when kim jong-un and his clan will have to take responsibility for the country ’ s dire condition , and it may come soon after kim kyong-hui dies .
if so , the kim dynasty ’ s last chapter may have begun with the current spasm of executions , though the ending – for the korean peninsula and east asia alike – remains very much in doubt .

the new neutrality
tokyo – throughout the cold war , the soviet union used every imaginable threat and inducement – including the ultimate prize of reunification – to bring about a neutral germany .
but german leaders of both the left and the right , from konrad adenauer to willy brandt , spurned every soviet offer .
will authoritarian mercantilism now succeed where communism failed ?
countries join alliances , or entities such as the european union , because these groups make the benefits and obligations of membership as unambiguous as anything in international relations can be .
for germany and south korea , however , relationships with historic allies – nato and the united states , respectively – appear to be changing before our eyes .
through their huge purchases of goods , with promises of even more to come , today ’ s authoritarian / mercantilist regimes in russia and china may be about to achieve by commerce what the soviets could not achieve by bribery and threats .
and the scale of that commerce is breathtaking , with german exports to china growing from $ 25.@@ 9 billion a decade ago to $ 8@@ 7.6 billion in 2011 , while south korea ’ s exports have increased from $ 53 billion to $ 133 billion during the same period of time .
a form of stealth neutrali@@ sm , indeed , appears to be entering both countries ’ diplomacy .
witness chinese president xi jinping ’ s recent trip to south korea , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s unwillingness to impose effective sanctions on russia for its intervention in ukraine , and the business-@@ only focus of her just-concluded visit to china .
in both germany and south korea , the idea that historic alliances may offer fewer tangible benefits than tacit neutrality – particularly in terms of exports – appears to be taking root , especially among business elites .
xi ’ s visit to seoul was another bold step in china ’ s systematic efforts to wean south korea from its commitment to the us-led international economic order .
by offering to permit south korea to settle its bilateral trade accounts in renminbi , and to launch the first-ever sino-@@ south korean initiative toward north korea , xi is seeking to convince south korea ’ s leaders that the country ’ s future , including reunification , will be determined in beijing .
china ’ s invitation to south korea to participate in a new asian infrastructure investment bank ( alongside other countries in asia and the arab world , but excluding japan and india ) fur@@ thers xi ’ s efforts to create an alternative financial system , with the aiib mimicking the asia development bank ’ s work .
china ’ s embrace of south korea is part of a long-term strategy to turn it into a subordinate state in terms of foreign and national security policy ( much as finland kowtowed to the soviet union throughout the cold war ) .
and yet , though courted by all sides in the struggle to maintain stability in northeast asia , south korea now runs the risk of becoming isolated .
every gesture by the south toward one of the protagonists – china , the us , japan , and north korea – elicits so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow devise a compensatory policy .
for example , following president park geun-hye ’ s request that xi honor the korean assassin of a japanese prime minister , to which xi readily agreed , she began to discuss joining the us-led trans-pacific partnership free-trade negotiations , in order to assuage the us .
as china continued to pursue an anti-japanese propaganda campaign throughout 2013 , park felt obliged to make some effort to revive ties with japan by sending a private envoy to prime minister shinzo abe to seek talks on reconciling their disputes .
given its insecurity , a by-product of the korean peninsula ’ s long division , south korea requires , above all , calm and steady partners .
but frequent changes in us policy toward northeast asia in recent years have disoriented south korean policymakers , while chinese policy , though consistent , confronts south korea ’ s leaders with choices that they appear unprepared to make .
as a result , south korea ’ s elite appears to be splitting into pro-chinese and pro-american factions that transcend party lines .
over a period of time , the only beneficiaries are likely to be those who call for “ finlandization ” of the korean peninsula .
meanwhile , the impact on german foreign policy of the country ’ s deepening economic ties with russia has been evident throughout the ukraine crisis .
though merkel frequently admonished the kremlin about its intervention in ukraine , german public opinion – particularly that of the country ’ s business leaders – tied her hands .
indeed , german big businesses have been the main obstacle to imposing the type of systemic sanctions that might have dissuaded russian president vladimir putin from annexing crimea and continuing to back the insurgency ( which russia itself incited ) in eastern ukraine .
this is not the only recent case in which germany has distanced itself from its allies and partners .
in libya in 2011 , germany refused to offer even rudimentary material support to the military intervention staged by its british and french allies .
germany has also continuously failed to meet its commitment to spend 2 % of its gdp on defense , at the same time that it has insisted that troubled eu economies stick to austerity budgets that limit their deficits to a fixed proportion of their economic output .
indeed , throughout the eurozone crisis , germany did the absolute minimum – and always at the last possible moment – to assist its eu partners .
and german leaders ’ obsession with maintaining their country ’ s “ golden decade ” of exports appears to have gagged them on topics like china ’ s human rights abuses and its aggressive behavior toward its asian neighbors .
that silence is being rewarded with the first-ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictatorship , which will take place in berlin this autumn .
in both germany and south korea , economic strength seems to have produced an illusion of policy independence that is opening a chasm between the two countries and their allies – a chasm that revelations of us spying , on merkel in particular , have deepened .
germany and south korea , however , will gain little , and risk much , if they downgrade their alliance ties in favor of commercially motivated , if unofficial , neutrality .
whatever short-term benefits they receive will be more than offset by their strategic vulnerabilities vis-à-vis russia and china .

ending east asia ’ s history wars
tokyo – georges clemenceau , who , as france ’ s prime minister , led his country to victory in world war i , famously said that “ war is too important to be left to the generals . ”
japan is now discovering that history is too important to be left to newspaper editors .
in the 1990s , the newspaper asahi shimbun caused a firestorm at home and in south korea by publishing a series of articles , based upon testimony by the former japanese soldier seiji yoshida , on “ comfort women ” – koreans forced to provide sexual services to the japanese imperial army during world war ii .
asahi has now admitted that the soldier ’ s confessions were unfounded , and has disavowed the core supporting evidence for the articles .
that retraction appears to be causing as much embarrassment – and diplomatic vitriol – in japan and south korea today as the original series did .
but , at a time when both countries cannot afford to permit partisan or sloppy abuses of history to roil their bilateral relations , asahi ’ s careless work has turned out to be more than abysmal journalism ; it has introduced a dangerous element into regional diplomacy .
some say that japan and south korea should follow the example set by france and germany .
reconciling in the first two decades following the nazi occupation of france , these countries ’ leaders understood that their security and economic ties were far too important to their citizens ’ wellbeing to allow the old hatreds to fester .
they knew that the unimaginable violence of wwii was a direct result of the antagonisms that had festered since the napoleonic wars and that were allowed to persist after 1918 .
in charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer , france and germany had two of the twentieth century ’ s greatest statesmen , leaders who were able to discern the broad sweep of history through the fog of quotidian politics .
their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them , but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of franco-german enmity , and to generations yet to come , which would benefit from reconciliation .
of course , given that japan and korea have not fought a series of wars against each other , their relationship is not the same as that between germany and france .
but it is clear that no one will benefit from a new round of heated historical debate .
to avoid this , political leaders like de gaulle and adenauer are needed .
only when we can discuss the past without endangering the future will the countries of northeast asia be able to establish a truly durable structure of peace .
as admiral dennis c. blair , a former commander of the us pacific fleet , stated at a recent conference , “ the history of asia from the 1930s to about 1955 or so was not pretty in any way … .@@ i don ’ t think any country can have a monopoly on righteousness , or on guilt and shame ” for that time .
blair added that “ the attempt to hold a ‘ we were right ’ and ‘ you were wrong ’ sweepstakes is not going to help our children and grandchildren understand what happened there . ”
japan and south korea need to take responsibility for the future , not obsess about the past .
a recent japanese government white paper called south korea the country “ that shares the closest relationship with japan historically and in areas such as economy and culture . ” no doubt , many , if not most , south korean foreign-policy experts and strategists share that sentiment .
but it will take committed leadership to transcend the history wars and tap the full potential of japanese-@@ korean cooperation , something that both countries ’ key ally , the united states , strongly desires , as it seeks to draw china into a lasting and peaceful asian order .
for too long , intemperate historical debates – often driven by biased newspaper accounts – have poisoned bilateral relations .
now , as another war of words heats up , japanese and south korean leaders need to step back , recognize where the real interests of their people lie , both today and in the future , and calmly begin to take the measures required to ensure durable reconciliation .

the enigma of european defense
paris – while europe ’ s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy , most european leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one – including at last month ’ s european council meeting .
what accounts for this paradox ?
one possible explanation is that financially strained european governments lack the means to fulfill their citizens ’ expectations .
but that is unconvincing , given that the issue was framed in almost identical terms three decades ago , when budgetary constraints were not a problem .
in fact , it could be argued that such constraints should spur , not impede , the creation of a european defense structure .
after all , member countries would then be able to pool their resources , harmonize programs , and rationalize costs , thereby reducing individual governments ’ financial burden .
another , far more credible explanation is that europeans ’ interpretations of “ a more active and stronger security policy ” differ widely .
indeed , current discussions in europe concerning the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives , championed by france , the united kingdom , and germany .
france , which has once again intervened in africa – this time to restore order in the central african republic – is the only european union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust european security structures .
the french consider europe to be a kind of superpower – a status that implies a corresponding military capacity .
while this view probably stems from france ’ s historical political and military prowess , it also reflects the country ’ s current interests .
as europe ’ s greatest military power ( despite the uk ’ s larger defense budget ) , france would play a key role in any wide-ranging european military operation .
the uk , for its part , shares france ’ s belief that military power is a prerequisite to strategic effectiveness .
it claims that its opposition to a european defense structure stems from its belief that nato – and thus the united states – is critical to european defense .
but , given that no other eu country has seriously considered excluding nato , this argument seems to be little more than an excuse .
the truth is that the only kind of defense the british accept is that conducted by a coalition of european states acting under their national flags , as occurred in libya .
in the uk ’ s view , “ european ” operations should be limited to humanitarian and peacekeeping objectives .
while it supported the fight against piracy off the horn of africa , that was more a policing operation than a military one , and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade routes from the middle east and asia .
germany ’ s vision of european defense is very different from the french and british perspectives .
unlike the uk , germany supports a european security and defense policy , proudly highlighting its consistent military budget and major presence in european missions ( larger than that of the overstretched french ) .
and , though germany shares the uk ’ s belief that nato bears primary responsibility for protecting europe , its view of european engagement is even more restrictive .
in germany ’ s view , european military intervention should be limited to the continent , and should not include combat operations .
in fact , a majority of europe ’ s citizens prefer that european forces be deployed only for non-combat missions .
and , so far , virtually all european military operations have been aimed at evacuating european nationals , delivering humanitarian aid , or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict .
these differing views explain the uncertainty surrounding france ’ s recent interventions in africa .
the french have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of europe for its operations in mali and the central african republic – exemplified by germany ’ s refusal to create a fund for eu member-state operations .
but , given the urgency of the situations in libya , mali , and the central african republic , this lack of support has not undermined france ’ s efforts as much as prior consultation with european leaders would have done .
had the germans been consulted , they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway .
this conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliberation explains why the eu ’ s much-discussed “ battlegroups ” are unlikely ever to be deployed .
the fact that most europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely .
a pessimist would say that europeans are unable – or at least unwilling – to rethink their defense policy , because the us ultimately ensures their security through nato .
according to this view , france ’ s efforts to encourage both transatlantic integration and autonomous political action are insufficient to change most europeans ’ minds .
a more optimistic interpretation is that europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states – not just for that of the eu .
from this perspective , europe does have a significant military presence , whether in afghanistan and libya or mali and the central african republic .
that is a start .

a zero-carbon economy is within reach
beijing – when the paris climate agreement was concluded in december 2015 , almost all the world ’ s countries committed to limit global warming to well below 2 ° celsius relative to pre-industrial levels , and have submitted “ intended nationally determined contributions ” ( indcs ) describing how they will either contain or reduce emissions over the next decade .
global investment in renewable power now far exceeds investment in fossil fuel plants ; battery costs are falling , and electric vehicle sales rising ; and even in president donald trump ’ s america , coal-fired power stations continue to close .
but despite this progress , the latest report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) contains a chilling prediction : on current trends , the world is heading toward 3 ° c of global warming by 2100 , to a level not reached for more than a million years .
the harm to human welfare is likely to be catastrophic .
the ipcc report makes it clear that the ideal target should be to limit warming to 1.5 ° c. above that level , the adverse consequences become ever more extreme .
but to achieve that goal , global carbon dioxide emissions would have to reach net zero by about 2055 , and still earlier if , as is unfortunately inevitable , emissions remain at current levels for several more years .
the precise implications for acceptable emissions from power stations , industrial plants , transport networks , and heating systems depend on how rapidly emissions caused by land-use change such as deforestation can be eliminated , and how rapidly emissions of non-@@ co2 greenhouse gases ( for example , methane or nitrous oxide ) can be reduced .
but it ’ s clear that unless we get to net zero emissions from energy use and industry by around 2060 – and earlier in developed economies – we will have to rely on the risky assumption that land-use changes can deliver large negative emissions in the late twenty-first century .
failing that , warming will rise significantly above 1.5 ° c .
getting to net zero emissions in just four decades will be a huge challenge .
but as a forthcoming report from the energy transitions commission argues , the good news is that it is undoubtedly technically possible , and at an acceptably low cost to the global economy .
moreover , we already know the key technologies we need to achieve this objective .
all feasible paths to a low-carbon economy and , eventually , net zero co2 emissions require a massive increase in the role of electricity .
the share of electricity in final energy demand will have to grow from around 20 % today to around 60 % by mid- to late century , and total global electricity generation will have to rise dramatically , from around 25,000 twh today to as much as 100,000 twh .
that electricity must come from low-carbon sources .
and while nuclear power and gas generation offset by carbon capture may play a role , the lion ’ s share will have to come from renewable sources – 70-80 % in the ipcc ’ s scenarios .
but there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale , and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast .
three other sets of technologies will also be essential .
first , hydrogen , ammonia , and perhaps methanol must be used as energy carriers in transport and industrial applications and as chemical feedstock inputs .
all three will eventually be produced synthe@@ tically , using clean electricity as the ultimate energy source .
second , biomass could provide low-carbon aviation fuel , or feedstock for plastics production .
the total scale of use , however , will need to be carefully managed to avoid harmful impacts on ecosystems and food supply .
third , there should be at least some role for carbon capture , and either storage or use , in key industrial processes such as cement production , where viable alternative routes to decarbonization are currently unavailable .
building a zero-carbon economy will of course require massive investment in power production and transmission , new industrial plants , and more efficient equipment .
to achieve the 1.5 ° c objective , the ipcc estimates that the required additional global investment , from 2015 to 2050 , could be $ 900 billion per annum .
that may seem like a startlingly high figure ; but , assuming 3 % annual economic growth , global gdp , which stands at almost $ 100 trillion today , could reach $ 260 trillion by 2050 .
this implies that the world needs to invest less than 0.6 % of its income over the next four decades to avoid potentially catastrophic harm to human welfare .
china alone currently invests more than $ 5 trillion each year , a significant proportion of which is wasted on the construction of apartment blocks which will never be occupied in cities which face static and eventually declining populations .
by redirecting investment , china could build a zero-carbon economy without any sacrifice of consumption .
for the world as a whole , the impact on living standards of achieving net zero emissions will be trivial .
but while a zero-carbon economy is undoubtedly technically feasible and easily affordable , it will not be achieved without strong public policies and forward-looking business strategies .
governments must deliver carbon pricing and product regulation and support key technologies and infrastructures , and companies in the energy-producing and main energy-using sectors must develop strategies focused on how to achieve zero emissions by mid-century and how to begin the transition today .
the alternative is another decade of only incremental progress , which will put us on a catastrophic path toward 3 ° c warming within the lifetime of today ’ s children .

zhu rongji reexamined
as china &apos;s new leadership team emerges , the world &apos;s attention has focused on president jiang zemin &apos;s successor .
but this is misguided , for perhaps the most significant moment in china &apos;s recent history of boom and transformation was the 1998 appointment of zhu rongji ( pronounced &quot; jo@@ o rong-@@ jee &quot; ) as premier of the state council , a position once held by deng xiaoping .
given the obvious importance of the post in recent years , the choice of mr. zhu &apos;s replacement may be of even more significance than president jiang &apos;s departure from center stage .
even before he became premier , mr. zhu , as the president of china &apos;s central bank , was known as the architect of china &apos;s 8 % annual economic growth in the 1990s and the mastermind of its successful fight against inflation .
mr. zhu has been china &apos;s jack welch , the tough-minded , longtime ceo of the american conglomerate general electric-@@ -a man celebrated for his candor , his global sophistication , and his insistence on performance .
indeed , mr. zhu was renowned for punishing those who fell short of his expectations .
as mayor of shanghai , he once disciplined his tourist bureau officials by making them scrub the city &apos;s public toilets themselves .
a few months after his appointment as premier , mr. zhu delivered his &quot; three promises &quot; speech , in which he pledged to make three bold moves to secure a more vibrant , self-sustaining economy .
first , he would overhaul the 300,000 state-run national corporations that still conducted an overwhelming amount of china &apos;s business and accounted for the bulk of its economic activity .
more than 70 % of such companies were unprofitable and were propped up by government subsidy .
just as mr. welch promised to &quot; fix , close , or sell &quot; nonperforming divisions of general electric when he took over the company , mr. zhu threatened to fire chief executives of chinese firms that lost money for more than two consecutive years , and then either to shut them down or sell them .
this forced national corporations to be privatized and go public or to be overseen by provincial governments , a change that proved to be a major impetus for a sudden decentralization of china &apos;s governance structure--@@ another key legacy of mr. zhu &apos;s tenure .
second , mr. zhu said he would wipe out the many bad debts of china &apos;s banks and &quot; international trust companies . &quot;
many of these had contributed to a softening in china &apos;s economy by routinely lending money to insolvent corporations .
at the time , there were 245 such trust companies , which had such a poor record of repayment that overseas investors were beginning to shun china entirely .
reforming them would take 10 years , he said .
third , mr. zhu said he would streamline the central government and take on one of china &apos;s most pernicious problems : high-level corruption in government agencies .
he would propose measures including , for example , cutting links between government and organized crime , and making it more difficult for bureaucrats to accept bribes .
politicians often make bold promises but rarely keep them .
on july 1 , 2001 , at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the chinese communist party , mr. zhu assessed his progress .
his appraisal of his record in office is notably accurate , and stands as a convincing testament to the effectiveness of his leadership .
mr. zhu told the assembled communist leadership that he had fulfilled the first promise : many of china &apos;s public corporations had become profitable private entities or had been shut down .
those that were still operating were given stringent profitability targets , were allowed to choose the people they hired , and were encouraged to raise money on private stock exchanges , which effectively propelled them into the private sector as &quot; red chip &quot; corporations .
as for the second promise , more than 50 heads of financial institutions had at that point been fired ( more followed ) , and reforms had changed the investment climate dramatically .
instead of fleeing the country , capital was flowing in more rapidly than ever before .
mr. zhu &apos;s record concerning his third promise was more mixed .
while the size of the central government fell dramatically , with employment at the state council halved from 34,000 to 17,000 , corruption continued to fester .
despite mr. zhu &apos;s efforts , opposition from vested interests throughout the govern@@ ment--@@ particularly at the highest levels--@@ impeded reform .
nonetheless , zhu rongji &apos;s reforms created the kind of level playing field and rule of law on which a vibrant capitalist system depends .
that is a political legacy second to none in modern chinese history .

zika and reproductive rights
new york – mosquitoes know no boundaries , and neither does fear .
as public-health experts grapple with the zika virus , panic continues to spread around the world .
yet the crisis has brought to light two important truths .
the first revelation is how badly degraded public health systems have become , across latin america and beyond .
this did not happen by chance .
in large part , it is the result of pressure on developing countries by concessionary lenders , such as the international monetary fund , to cut social sector expenses , including health spending , beginning in 1980 .
in brazil and elsewhere , state authorities could have deployed well-known and cost-effective measures to control mosquito-borne diseases , but they did not .
their most affected citizens , who tend to be poor , have been forced to live with the consequences .
second , the zika epidemic has revealed , with particular poignancy , another dire threat to public health : the denial of women ’ s reproductive rights .
governments are shirking their responsibility in this regard too , often in a grotesque manner .
the reported spike in cases of microcephaly – a birth defect – among infants in zika-@@ affected areas led the governments of brazil , colombia , ecuador , and el salvador to warn their female citizens “ not to become pregnant . ”
this message , which places the blame and burden of the zika epidemic on women , is as unjust as it is unreasonable .
it is also toothless , as many women in the region do not have access to contraception or safe abortions .
the zika crisis has highlighted an obvious reality : not providing women with reproductive health information and services places their lives – and those of their children – at grave risk .
latin america ’ s abortion laws are among the world ’ s most restrictive .
el salvador , for example , bans abortion in all circumstances and has incarcerated women who have gone to emergency rooms after miscarriages , charging them with seeking illegal abortions .
contraception can also be expensive or difficult to access across the region , despite high rates of teenage rape and pregnancy .
the result , especially with the addition of the zika virus , is a recipe for tragedy .
brazil , the latin american country hit hardest by the virus so far , is emblematic of the problem : abortion is allowed only in cases of rape , danger to the woman ’ s life , or in the case of fetal anencephaly ( the absence of a major portion of the brain ) .
in response to the zika crisis , brazil should immediately allow abortion in cases of suspected microcephaly as well .
the loosening of restrictions , however , should not stop there .
over the last few years , conservatives in the brazilian congress have been trying to place limits on abortion in cases of rape .
these efforts – which demonstrate complete disregard for the rights and dignity of women – must end .
instead , women ’ s right to seek an abortion should be expanded – and quickly .
governments must also ensure that services are accessible and affordable .
wealthy brazilian women can afford to pay private health providers for safe abortions .
poor women are forced to resort to poorly trained and equipped providers who operate in unsanitary conditions , sometimes as part of criminal networks .
in september 2014 , two women died in rio de janeiro following clandestine abortions .
in the region overall , 95 % of abortions are unsafe .
in latin america and the caribbean , 62 % of women aged 15-49 want to avoid a pregnancy .
expense is only one barrier for poor women and girls ; another is the lack of information .
men and women need comprehensive sexuality education , so they are informed about their reproductive health and family planning options and know where they can get modern contraceptives .
recent evidence suggesting that zika might be transmitted sexually adds extra urgency to making male and female condoms and other contraceptives widely available .
the movement for reproductive rights has a long history in brazil and in other parts of latin america .
over the last several months – even before zika – feminists had been taking to the streets in outrage at the lack of access to safe and legal abortions .
the zika crisis may mark a turning point in the fight for women ’ s health and equality .
it is certainly a wake-up call for governments everywhere to rebuild and strengthen public health systems , and to guarantee all women and girls access to contraceptives and safe abortions .
women and girls around the world know the alternative – and it is terrifying .

the injustices of zika
southampton – outbreaks of communicable diseases in the developing world are bad enough from a health perspective .
but they also have serious implications for social justice , because they exacerbate longstanding human-rights crises , including by undermining already-weak public-@@ services provision and deepening existing inequalities .
like the 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa , the zika outbreak in central and south america in 2015 hit vulnerable social groups – women and children , ethnic minorities , and the poor – the hardest .
like yellow fever , dengue , and other diseases , zika is transmitted by aedes aegypti mosquitoes .
but , unusually for a mosquito-borne virus , zika can also be transmitted sexually .
even more unusual , it is associated with neurological and developmental conditions affecting babies : microcephaly and guillain-bar@@ r@@ é syndrome .
otherwise , its symptoms are often rather mild .
this means that , of the more than 1.5 million people stricken by zika since the outbreak , the consequences were most worrying for women of child-bearing age , especially those who were already pregnant .
between 2016 and 2017 , a total of 1@@ 1,0@@ 59 zika cases in pregnant women were confirmed , producing 10,@@ 867 cases of microcephaly and other congenital mal@@ formations of their babies ’ central nervous systems .
fifty-@@ six percent of those babies were born to poor women and women of color from northeast brazil .
clearly , the zika crisis is not gender-neutral .
in addressing its medium- to long-term consequences , a focus on women – especially poor women – is needed .
that does not mean more media coverage of the deformities associated with microcephaly or even of the difficulties faced by their mothers .
and it certainly does not mean more efforts to police women ’ s behavior .
to avoid infection , women have been advised to use mosquito repellent ; remove standing water around their homes ; wear long sleeves ; and , if possible , use condoms or avoid sex .
the us center for disease control and prevention advised pregnant women to refrain from traveling to affected countries .
most extreme , health officials in el salvador and colombia urged women not to get pregnant until 2018 .
such recommendations , however well intended they may be , are fundamentally flawed .
for starters , they emphasize short-@@ term-@@ vector control and surveillance , while delinking the disease from the social and structural determinants of health , including public infrastructure such as running water , proper sanitation , and access to care .
they also place the responsibility for avoiding disease and pregnancy primarily on women , while failing to recognize the lack of control many women have over their bodies and pregnancies .
many of the areas affected by zika have high rates of sexual violence and teen pregnancy , a lack of sex education , and inadequate access to contraceptives .
for these reasons , more than 50 % of pregnancies in latin america are unintended .
making matters worse , in most latin american countries affected by zika , abortion is illegal , or permitted only in exceptional situations .
for example , in el salvador , where more than 7,000 cases of zika were reported between december 2015 and january 2016 , abortions are illegal under all circumstances .
miscarriages , if proven to be self-induced , can even lead to homicide convictions .
the position of the united states hasn ’ t helped , either .
last year , us president barack obama ’ s administration asked congress for $ 1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the zika threat .
but abortion politics intervened , as republican lawmakers , leading a congressional hearing on the zika outbreak , made the funding conditional on anti-abortion policies in recipient countries .
the problems with the dominant approach to containing the zika virus – namely , that it sad@@ dles women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power – are not lost on everyone .
last year , the united nations refugee agency and the world health organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the zika outbreak .
but , while high-level recognition of women ’ s sexual and reproductive rights is a positive step , it is far from sufficient .
and doing what is needed to protect those rights , particularly among poor and vulnerable women in developing countries , will require deep and sustained political commitment .
in particular , national legislation must be revised to ensure that all women – whether they are carrying a baby with microcephaly or not – have full reproductive autonomy .
women must be able to base their reproductive choices on their own physical and emotional needs and desires , not on the moral judgments of powerful agents or risk of criminal sanctions .
advocacy groups in brazil , for example , are already pushing for such an outcome , submitting legal cases to the supreme court to secure greater reproductive rights for women , including the right to safe and legal abortion .
those cases tend to lean on the 1988 national constitution , which guarantees the right to abortion in case of rape , danger to the mother ’ s life , or anencephaly , another birth defect involving the brain .
in pursuing these changes , campaigns should also recognize and address the links between women ’ s and disability rights .
indeed , they should advance equality for all marginalized groups .
zika ’ s medium- and long-term consequences must be addressed with this in mind .
when a woman gives birth to a child with a congenital syndrome deriving from the zika virus , the response should be grounded in the dignity , value , and rights of each individual .
it should acknowledge the processes that keep certain individuals and groups in poverty and that deny them the basic rights of citizens .
that is why campaigners must insist that the state be responsible for providing appropriate care and support services for each woman and child – services that both meet their needs and respect their rights .

zimbabwe &apos;s last chance
as the world rooted for former united nations secretary general kofi annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in kenya , many also found themselves wondering whether a weary annan , or some other global leader , will be battling another fire by the end of this month : this time in zimbabwe .
zimbabwe ’ s upcoming elections , scheduled for march 29 , offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country ’ s hellish conditions .
even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000 % , and the plight of ordinary zimbabweans grows more desperate by the day .
the elections could bring zimbabweans a chance to end the long dictatorship of president robert mugabe .
but , without supervision , they will be held in an environment that could dash zimbabweans ’ hopes .
zimbabweans are denied their basic freedoms and subjected to violence .
torture is widespread .
civil society groups report the arrests of opposition electoral candidates , the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes , and violent incidents of voter intimidation .
the zimbabwe election support network has also expressed concern about the country ’ s state of readiness for this complex election , which will combine presidential , parliamentary , senatorial , and local government contests .
and this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution , censored media , and a partisan security and military establishment .
it didn ’ t have to be this way .
south african president thabo mbeki convened negotiations with zimbabwe ’ s political groups ; but they have been so un@@ fruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks .
some african leaders – notably ghana ’ s president , john kufuor , and outgoing african union head alpha konare – have tried to cajole mugabe towards reform , to no avail .
perhaps more significantly , the international community ’ s failure to address zimbabwe seriously shows , once again , that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises .
last year , un secretary general ban ki-moon and un high commissioner for human rights louise arbour condemned the regime ’ s use of torture and its mistreatment of pro-democracy forces .
regrettably , the un failed to follow up with institutional action .
the un would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action , such as sending official election observers .
but it is also true that with adequate political will , the un security council could live up to its responsibility to zimbabweans by responding to the crisis more aggressively .
the un should have put mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections .
instead , the un continues to defer to mugabe , who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace .
with so many lives at stake , what can be done to avert an intensification of the zimbabwe crisis ?
people of good will throughout the world , including those affiliated with multilateral organizations like the un , should descend on zimbabwe to observe this month ’ s elections .
accredited or not , they should stand in solidarity with the people of zimbabwe at this crucial moment , act as witnesses to the deteriorating pre-election environment , and serve as a bulwark against any escalation of state brutality during and after the vote .
mugabe would prefer to limit the presence of international observers to those sent by neighboring states – the same allies that somehow managed to deem the violent and fraudulent elections of the past seven years “ legitimate . ”
zimbabwe ’ s neighbors also face a choice : they can use their proximity to halt mugabe ’ s abuses , or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke .
their choice may depend on what the world demands of them .
the people of zimbabwe will play their part on march 29 .
as for the regional and world community , their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a reprise of the violence in kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future .

habeas corpus , latin for “ you have the body , ” is an old english common law principle incorporated into the us constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state .
it was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts .
in zimbabwe , this right – like so many other checks and balances – has been torn away by a repressive state .
just hours before the us supreme court ruling , tendai biti , the secretary-general of the opposition movement for democratic change ( mdc ) , was arrested upon his return to zimbabwe .
despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him , his whereabouts remained unknown for days .
the police dismissed an initial court order demanding that biti be produced before the court .
after biti was finally produced before the court days later , the government announced that he will be charged with treason – which carries the death penalty – for unofficially announcing the results of the march 29 , 2008 , elections . prior to his detention , biti had responded to such allegations by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in zimbabwe .
it is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court .
since 1999 , the mdc has offered a democratic alternative to president robert mugabe ’ s regime .
in the most recent elections , zimbabweans made their choice known , despite serious obstacles and widespread repression , with the mdc ’ s presidential candidate , morgan tsvangirai , gaining more votes than mugabe .
but , according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month-long delay , the mdc ’ s margin of victory – 48 % to 43 % – fell short of the 50 % required to avoid a run-off election .
biti is not the only mdc member to be “ disappeared ” for a period of time by mugabe ’ s government .
over the past two years , police and government-supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed , beaten , and even killed mdc officials and suspected mdc members .
last year , biti was detained and beaten along with tsvangirai and dozens of other mdc officials .
the photos of tsvangirai ’ s pummeled body led to an international outcry .
state-sponsored violence against the mdc and its supporters has escalated as the june 27 run-off vote draws near . just weeks ago , biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of tonderai ndira , an mdc youth leader .
ndira had been taken by the police from his home .
he was missing for seven days ; when his body was found , it was recognizable only by a bra@@ cel@@ et he always wore .
here in our offices in johannesburg , we have two zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights .
at least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks .
most recently , the zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence .
it is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence .
indeed , even south african president thabo mbeki , who , despite an outcry from many of his citizens , has supported mugabe , felt compelled to label it a “ cause for serious concern . ”
in the majority opinion in boumediene v. bush , justice anthony kennedy wrote that “ liberty and security can be reconciled ; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law . ” but there is no rule of law left in zimbabwe – no habeas corpus and no check on arbitrary state action .
it is time for the international community to step in , call for an end to the detention and disappearance of mdc officials and perceived supporters , and push for a democratic transition in zimbabwe .
only then can the principles underlying the supreme court ’ s decision come within reach of ordinary zimbabweans .

johannesburg – morgan tsvangirai ’ s withdrawal from the presidential run-off scheduled for june 27 , and his decision to seek the protection of the dutch embassy in pretoria , has secured for zimbabwe ’ s president robert mugabe a pyrrhic victory .
the actions of the mugabe regime in the run-up to tsvangirai ’ s decision demand a strong regional response to what is clearly a stolen victory . indeed , mugabe ’ s continuing in power represents the most serious challenge to africa ’ s nascent democratic institutions and to south africa ’ s vision of a continent of peace and prosperity .
after contesting every election since 2000 , tsvangirai ’ s movement for democratic change ( mdc ) has changed tactics reluctantly .
under the circumstances , south africa and the southern african development community ( sadc ) urgently need to reappraise their approach not only to mugabe , but to how they will deal with any uncontested election .
a host of declarations adopted over the years by the sadc and the african union address the conduct of elections on the continent .
these include the sadc principles and guidelines governing democratic elections ( 2004 ) , the african charter on democracy , elections , and governance ( 2007 ) , and the declaration on the principles governing democratic elections in africa ( 2002 ) .
none of these principles have been respected in zimbabwe , and regional leaders have not cited their violation as reason to censure mugabe ’ s government .
unfortunately , we have a recent precedent for this type of behavior : kenya ’ s rulers , too , ignored and twisted the rule of law and the integrity of the electoral process , relying on violence to secure a political outcome that their fellow citizens denied them .
dealing effectively with political instability in africa requires two things : the political will of key states to underwrite the democratic process , and strong regional institutions to provide a legal framework reflecting the principles underpinning states ’ behavior . the effectiveness of regional institutions and the role of regional powers are interlinked .
regional institutions can entrench themselves only if their members promote adherence to the spirit and letter of their legal frameworks .
in both cases , south africa – the main regional power with the most levers of influence over zimbabwe – has a vital role to play .
but does south africa really see itself as a regional power ?
its handling of mugabe over the past eight years has actually underplayed its leverage .
yet the mantle of a regional power sometimes requires using that leverage for the greater good of the region .
what should south africa do now ?
should president thabo mbeki step down as mediator in the zimbabwe crisis , not because he has failed , but to remove from south africa the constraints that being a mediator put in place ?
south africa has a vested interest in stability , and it can turn the screws on mugabe ’ s regime , much as it has refused to contemplate any form of sanctions because of their impact on the poor .
south africa must tap into the growing concern among zimbabwe ’ s neighbors ( angola , botswana , tanzania , and zambia ) about the political crisis , and forge a united front within the sadc that sends a clear message to mugabe and his generals that the region will no longer tolerate their actions .
the sadc should not endorse the regime ’ s claim of victory in an uncontested election .
it must insist that all opposition leaders and supporters be freed immediately , and that all state-sponsored violence be halted .
it should dispatch an eminent persons ’ group of senior african and other international leaders to zimbabwe , as well as peace monitors to ensure that the government complies with these demands .
the sadc ’ s censure of mugabe and his regime should be backed up by concrete actions , such as restrictions on all arms flows to zimbabwe , travel restrictions on senior officials of zimbabwe ’ s ruling zanu-pf party , and the threat of property seizures and the freezing of financial assets in the region and beyond .
mbeki and other sadc leaders should recognize a key point . according to legal opinions commissioned by the southern african litigation center , zimbabwe ’ s electoral act holds that the delay or absence of a lawful run-off means that the candidate who obtained the most votes in the election of march 29 , 2008 , has been duly elected as president .
moreover , south africa was instrumental in drafting the declaration on unconstitutional changes of government , adopted by the organization of african unity , the au ’ s predecessor , in 1999 .
the manner in which the electoral process in zimbabwe has been conducted since march has been an unconstitutional continuation of government .
the declaration clearly stipulates that an incumbent government ’ s refusal to relinquish power to the winning party after free , fair , and regular elections is unconstitutional .
if south africa sees itself as speaking for africa on the global stage and creating a vision for the continent ’ s future , it must know when to lead and how to build consensus .
none of this is easy , but south africa must now act decisively in order to polish its tarnished image as a responsible regional power . “ business as usual ” is no longer a viable approach for south african foreign policy .

zoellick to the rescue ?
will newly anointed world bank president robert zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of paul wolfowitz ?
although hardly a megawatt star of the bob rubin category , he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job .
first , as a key player in bringing china into the world trade organization , zoellick is a proven internationalist in an american administration where internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species .
second , he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade , which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid program .
third , he seems to have been a consistent behind-the-scenes supporter of the bank , whereas many of his bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices .
so presumably he has a constructive vision for the bank ’ s future .
but zoellick is not without his weaknesses .
first and foremost , his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an american in the job .
with the bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance , its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy .
the claim that the world bank needs an american president to ensure that the us keeps donating money is ridiculous .
the annual cost of the us contribution to the world bank , even taking into account off-the-books loan guarantees , is relatively minor .
any number of developing countries , from china to india to brazil , could easily step up if the us foolishly stepped down .
zoellick ’ s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job , either .
the world bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties , as zoellick did when he was us trade representative .
the bank ’ s most important role in development today is as a “ knowledge bank ” that helps aggregate , distill , and disseminate best practices from around the world .
in this respect , the bank ’ s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies .
moreover , many of the world bank president ’ s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way .
wrong economic decisions , such as in the 1970 ’ s , when robert mcnamara pushed grandiose , but environmentally devastating , infrastructure projects , have haunted the bank for decades .
the biggest question mark , though , is whether zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms .
reform number one , of course , is to ensure that the next world bank president is not an american .
rodrigo de rato , zoellick ’ s counterpart at the european-@@ dominated international monetary fund , has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process .
the world bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal .
second , zoellick should ask why the bank spends only 2.5 % of its budget on the “ knowledge bank ” research function that it trumpets so proudly in its external relations materials , while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board .
third , zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of world bank aid .
the idea that a big government-guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays .
true , the bank ’ s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets . by and large , however , the poorest countries need grants , not loans that they still won ’ t be able to pay in 20 years .
as the bank switches from loans to grants , it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its “ knowledge bank ” function and related technical advice .
but all this knowledge shouldn ’ t be free .
a lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears , with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on bank money .
instead of merely pushing its agenda , the bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven .
last but not least , the bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and , in general , in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries .
( some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades . )
of course , zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing , as some of his predecessors have done .
or , less likely , he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over-reaching vision of government intervention , as others have tried .
in any case , let ’ s wish him luck .
the world needs the world bank a lot more than it needs another condominium .

zuma rising
the anxiety over jacob zuma ’ s election as president of south africa obscures a significant milestone : for the first time in decades , a sub-saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people .
african politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats , soldiers , and technocrats .
even with the spread of democratic elections , the region ’ s leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers ( uganda , rwanda , zimbabwe ) , family dynasties ( togo , kenya , etc ) , or university professors , lawyers , and economists ( ghana , malawi , liberia ) .
now south africa , the region ’ s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities , media , and corporations , has a former goat her@@ der at its helm , a rare african leader with the common touch .
zuma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people .
he ’ s secure enough to dance and sing in public . he speaks the language of populism , raising hopes for the vast majority of south africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing , schools , and health care .
until now , populism has been the missing note in african political culture .
yet , while zuma ’ s populist appeal reflects south africa ’ s especially large differences in economic class , the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally .
moreover , zuma has been called a chameleon , accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear .
zuma ’ s turbulent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided hiv infection by taking a shower – has invited ridicule .
most seriously , doubts persist about his commitment to democracy , with critics arguing he ’ s an old-style african “ big man ” ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies .
dismissing complaints , zuma insists , “ there ’ s no cloud around me . ”
his defenders , meanwhile , point to two benefits that he has already delivered : an end to mbeki ’ s ambivalent approach to fighting hiv / aids , the country ’ s major public health threat , and a refreshing willingness to move against zimbabwe ’ s aged dictator , robert mugabe , whom mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid .
in an africa bereft of successful populist politicians , zuma ’ s role models may come from latin america , where income inequality is also extreme and the trade-union movement , as in south africa , is strong and militant .
with enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains , zuma the populist will quickly face a major test : will he emulate lula of brazil , who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and re-distribution of wealth to the poor ?
or will he follow the path of hugo chávez , a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor .
the stakes for africa are enormous .
south africa has the continent ’ s largest economy and , until the global financial crisis , posted 10 years of steady economic growth .
in an economic slowdown , the country ’ s severe crime problem might only worsen ; so might unemployment , which already tops 20 % in the formal economy .
zuma senses the urgency of the situation .
he is , after all , 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office . “ we can ’ t waste time , ” he says .
yet , according to the political economist moeletsi mbeki , at his core , “ zuma is a conservative . ” in this sense , zuma represents yesterday ’ s south africa .
he is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black-@@ majority rule .
their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history .
at the same time , zuma ’ s revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading south africa in a post-apartheid era that is now 15 years old .
in a region that reveres the elderly , zuma ’ s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country ’ s youth .
three in ten south africans are younger than 15 , meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid .
somehow zuma must find a way to honor his own generation ’ s commitment to racial justice and national liberation , while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain .
