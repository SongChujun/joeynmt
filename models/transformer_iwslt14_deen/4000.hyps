got it , i see if they are sold out at this day , it looks like they would be an opening at 8 : 30am , would that work for you ?
yes , that would be perfect .
ok , let me schedule that for you , one moment.please note that there is a $ 89 inspection fee but that can be applied to the cost of repairs .
yes . that &apos;s no problem .

no , that would be all .
