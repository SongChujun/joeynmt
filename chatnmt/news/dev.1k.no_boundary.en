ameri@@ ca and europ@@ e divided over sad@@ dam
talk is growing of a change in us defense doc@@ tr@@ ine to allow for pre-@@ emp@@ tive strikes on states that har@@ bor weapons of mass destruction .
that talk is sending sh@@ u@@ d@@ ders across europ@@ e , where many people connect it with ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s o@@ ft-@@ stated desire to remove sad@@ dam hus@@ sein from power in i@@ ra@@ q .
ever since the g@@ ulf war , i@@ ra@@ q has been a source of fri@@ ction among the western permanent members of the un security council .
by the end of 1999 , diver@@ gence was complete : the united states and b@@ rit@@ ain were emplo@@ ying their air power to enforce the no-@@ fly zones while fran@@ ce joined rus@@ sia and ch@@ ina in ab@@ sta@@ ining on resolution 12@@ 84 .
as this u@@ k-@@ spon@@ sored resolution was meant to bring the i@@ ra@@ q issue back to the security council after the withdrawal of the un weapons inspec@@ tors and subsequent ameri@@ can air strikes of dec@@ ember 1998 , hope for progress on i@@ ra@@ q within the security council was sc@@ ant .
this rapidly changed after last se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 11@@ th .
on may 14 , 2002 , the security council gave the tot@@ tering sanctions regime a new lease on life by unanimously adopting a simplified screening procedure .
even i@@ ra@@ q showed signs of being prepared to consider a possible return of the un weapons inspec@@ tors .
at first sight this seems to bo@@ de well for the transatlantic relationship .
in reality , the current relaxation is more likely a l@@ ull before the storm .
most europ@@ e@@ ans take it for granted that the us will attack i@@ ra@@ q , and that this act of unilater@@ alism , coming in the wake of all the other ir@@ rit@@ ants such as the ab@@ m treaty , the k@@ yo@@ to agreement , the steel tariffs and the international criminal court , will have a devastating effect on transatlantic relations .
europ@@ e would be ill-@@ advised to become mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by this appro@@ aching disaster .
everyone under@@ stands that the i@@ ra@@ q@@ i government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s improved attitude is caused by the b@@ ush administration &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s sab@@ re-@@ r@@ att@@ ling , but no one can tell whether this is a pre@@ lu@@ de to an inevitable war or a str@@ at@@ a@@ gem to make i@@ ra@@ q cooperate with un weapons inspec@@ tors .
obviously , the us cannot remove this uncertainty without rob@@ bing the sab@@ re-@@ r@@ att@@ ling of its beneficial effect .
given this ambigu@@ ity , there remains time for europ@@ e to engage the us in a serious discussion of the options for dealing with sad@@ dam .
the common aim should be to remove the threat posed by a dict@@ ator with so well-@@ documented a pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction for weapons of mass destruction .
the options vary from resumed inspections to `@@ regime change &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; .
there are arguments which make the choice far less clear@@ -@@ cut than it may seem .
several of these are also being advanced within the b@@ ush administration .
europ@@ e can construc@@ tively participate in such discussion provided it first cle@@ ars the way by :
1. ri@@ dding itself of its constant in@@ dig@@ nation about the conduct of the b@@ ush administration .
that in@@ dig@@ nation seems strongest among those who have not even bo@@ ther@@ ed to read the ameri@@ can arguments .
europ@@ e does not increase its influence by ber@@ ating the us for acting in its national interest ;
2. showing some understanding for the view of some in the b@@ ush administration that the us should not be bo@@ gged down by a continent that is soft , dec@@ a@@ dent and mor@@ alizing .
this is not a pleasant way of putting it , but many ameri@@ cans remember how on two occasions in the former y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via - a pre-@@ emin@@ ently europ@@ ean theatre - europ@@ e was hel@@ pl@@ ess until ameri@@ can war@@ plan@@ es showed up ;
3. making clear that europ@@ e and the us are on the same side , not only in the war on terror generally but also in dealing with sad@@ dam .
the demonstrations that will rock europ@@ ean cities the day i@@ ra@@ q is attacked must be counter@@ acted in advance by un@@ equi@@ vocal europ@@ ean statements to that effect .
this debate about how to deal with sad@@ dam might go as follows .
it is not difficult to over@@ throw sad@@ dam , but it is impossible to pre@@ dict who or what will take his place .
i@@ ra@@ q may even dis@@ integrate , leaving us with a much stronger ir@@ an , also a member of the axis of evil but one with a more dangerous mix , namely nuclear ambitions plus fundament@@ alism .
moreover , sad@@ dam may already possess a weapon of mass destruction but has been deter@@ red from using it .
once he is attacked by the us , he may use it against isra@@ el , which will re@@ tali@@ ate .
so it may well be wis@@ er to in@@ duce i@@ ra@@ q to read@@ mit the un weapons inspec@@ tors and make sure they can do their job .
this will not entirely remove the i@@ ra@@ q@@ i threat but will make it controll@@ able .
should this be the outcome , europ@@ ean governments would brea@@ the a si@@ gh of relief .
but the debate may also go the other way .
sad@@ dam will cooperate with un inspec@@ tors only as long as the ameri@@ can threat remains , and the us may conclude that it cannot afford that .
if president b@@ ush then op@@ ts for regime change , europ@@ e should not opt out .
this is easier said than done .
many europ@@ e@@ ans will argue that they cannot con@@ done military action without a security council mandate .
but they already did , twice .
they con@@ don@@ ed or even supported ameri@@ can air strikes against bag@@ h@@ dad in dec@@ ember 1998 , and they supported or even participated in nat@@ o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s air strikes against the federal re@@ public of y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via in mar@@ ch 1999 .
true , some will say , but that was under the clin@@ ton administration .
if europ@@ e conve@@ ys the impression that its friend@@ ship with ameri@@ ca depends on who wins the us presidential elections , it is likely to free@@ ze the transatlantic relationship for years .
ameri@@ ca and global public goods
ameri@@ ca is currently trans@@ fixed with the problem it has created for itself in i@@ ra@@ q , but the presidential candidates are also beginning to ask what principles should guide united states foreign policy after i@@ ra@@ q .
in my view , a focus on global public goods – things everyone can consu@@ me without dimin@@ ishing their availability to others – could help ameri@@ ca re@@ conci@@ le its prep@@ onder@@ ant power with others ’ interests .
of course , pure public goods are rare .
most only partially approach the ideal case of clean air , where none can be excluded and all can benefit simultaneously .
combating global climate change is probably the most dramatic current case .
if the largest beneficiary of a public good ( like the us ) does not take the lead in de@@ voting disproportionate resources toward its provision , smaller beneficiaries are unlikely to be able to produce it because of the difficulties of organizing collective action when large numbers are involved .
while this responsibility often lets others become “ free ri@@ ders , ” the alternative is no ride for anyone .
the us could gain dou@@ bly , both from the public goods themselves , and from the way they legitim@@ ize its prep@@ onder@@ ant power in the eyes of others .
ameri@@ ca can learn from the lesson the nine@@ teenth century , when great b@@ rit@@ ain was a prep@@ onder@@ ant power and took the lead in maintaining the balance of power between europ@@ e ’ s major states , promoting an open international economic system , and maintaining freedom of the seas .
these issues remain relevant today , and the establishment of rules that preserve access for all remains as much a public good now as it was then , even though some of the issues are more complex .
maintaining regional balances of power and dam@@ pen@@ ing local incentives to use force to change borders provides a public good for many ( but not all ) countries .
simil@@ arly , maintaining open global markets is a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for allevi@@ ating poverty in poor countries even as it benefits the us .
today , however , global public goods include new issues – not only climate change , but also preservation of endanger@@ ed species , outer space , and the “ virtual comm@@ ons ” of cy@@ ber@@ space .
a reasonable consensus in ameri@@ can public opinion supports ensuring both these and the “ classic ” global public goods , even if the us has failed to lead on some issues , notably global climate .
there are also three new dimensions of global public goods in today ’ s world .
first , the us should take the lead in helping to develop and maintain international laws and institutions to organize collective action to deal with not only trade and the environment , but also weapons proliferation , peac@@ eke@@ eping , human rights , and other concerns .
others benefit from the order that such efforts provide , but so does the us .
likewise , while unilater@@ alists compla@@ in that the us is constra@@ ined by international regimes , so are others .
second , the us should make international development a higher priority .
much of the poor majority of the world is mi@@ red in a vi@@ cious circle of disease , poverty , and political instability .
financial and scientific help from rich countries is important not only for humanitarian reasons , but also to prevent failed states from becoming sources of dis@@ order for the rest of the world .
here , too , ameri@@ ca ’ s record is less than impressive .
protection@@ ist trade measures often h@@ urt poor countries most , and foreign assistance is generally un@@ popular with the ameri@@ can public .
development will take a long time , and the international community needs to explore better ways to make sure that help actually reaches the poor , but both pru@@ dence and a concern for soft power suggest that the us should take the lead .
finally , as a prep@@ onder@@ ant power , the us can provide an important public good by acting as a medi@@ ator and conven@@ er .
by using its good offices to medi@@ ate conflicts in places like northern i@@ reland , mor@@ occo , and the ae@@ ge@@ an sea , the us has helped in shaping international order in ways that are beneficial to other nations .
the middle east is the crucial current case .
it is sometimes temp@@ ting to let in@@ trac@@ table conflicts fest@@ er , and there are some situations where other countries can play the medi@@ ator ’ s role more effectively .
even when the us does not want to take the lead , it can share leadership with others , such as with europ@@ e in the bal@@ kan@@ s .
but often the us is the only country that can bring parties together .
when successful , such leadership increases ameri@@ can soft power while reducing sources of instability .
the us can also encourage other countries to share in production of such public goods .
welcoming the rise of chin@@ ese power in terms of that country ’ s becoming a “ responsible stakehol@@ der ” is an invitation to begin such a dialogue .
nevertheless , the us is likely to remain the world ’ s prep@@ onder@@ ant power even after it ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ates itself from i@@ ra@@ q .
but it will have to learn to work with other countries to share leadership .
that will require combining the soft power of attraction with the hard power of military might to produce a “ smart power ” strategy for providing global public goods .
ameri@@ ca at st@@ all speed ?
new@@ port beach – jud@@ ging from the sk@@ it@@ ti@@ sh@@ ness of both markets and “ consensus expectations , ” the united states ’ economic prospects are conf@@ using .
one day , the country is on the br@@ ink of a double-@@ di@@ p recession ; the next , it is on the ver@@ ge of a tur@@ bo@@ -@@ charged recovery , powered by re@@ sili@@ ent consumers and us multination@@ als starting to deplo@@ y , at long last , their massive cash reserves .
in the process , markets take investors on a wild roll@@ er@@ coast@@ er ride , with the europ@@ ean crisis ( ri@@ dd@@ led with even more confusion and vol@@ atility ) serving to ag@@ grav@@ ate their qu@@ eas@@ iness .
this situation is both understandable and increasingly un@@ sett@@ ling for ameri@@ ca ’ s well-being and that of the global economy .
it reflects the impact of fundamental ( and historic ) economic and financial re-@@ align@@ ments , insufficient policy responses , and system@@ -@@ wide rigi@@ dities that frustr@@ ate structural change .
as a result , there are now legitimate questions about the underlying functioning of the us economy and , therefore , its evolution in the months and years ahead .
one way to understand current conditions – and what is needed to improve them – is to consider two events that recently attracted considerable worldwide attention : the launch of bo@@ eing ’ s dre@@ am@@ liner passenger jet and the tragic death of app@@ le ’ s ste@@ ve jobs .
let us start with some simple aer@@ on@@ au@@ tic dynam@@ ics , using an an@@ alog@@ y that my p@@ im@@ co colleague , bill gross , came up with to describe the economic risks facing the ameri@@ can economy .
for the dre@@ am@@ liner to take off , as@@ c@@ end , and maintain a steady altitude , it must do more than move forward .
it has to move forward fast enough to exceed critical physical thresh@@ olds , which are significantly higher than those for most of bo@@ eing ’ s other ( smaller ) plan@@ es .
failure would mean succ@@ umb@@ ing to a mid-@@ air st@@ all , with te@@ p@@ id forward motion giving way to a sudden loss of altitude .
unless we are convinced of the dre@@ am@@ liner ’ s ability to avoid st@@ all speed , it makes no sense to talk about all the ways in which it will enhance the travel experience for millions of people around the world .
ameri@@ ca ’ s economy today risks st@@ all speed .
specifically , the question is not whether it can grow , but whether it can grow fast enough to prop@@ el a large economy that , according to the us federal reserve , faces “ bal@@ ance-@@ sheet dele@@ ver@@ aging , credit constraints , and household and business uncertainty about the economic outlook . ”
and , remember , it is just over a year since certain us officials were proc@@ laim@@ ing the economy ’ s “ summer of recovery ” – a view underp@@ inn@@ ed by the er@@ ron@@ eous belief that ameri@@ ca was reaching “ escape vel@@ o@@ city . ”
st@@ all speed is a terri@@ fying risk for an economy like that of the us , which desper@@ ately needs to grow robu@@ stly .
without rapid growth , there is no way to reverse persist@@ ently high and increasingly structural ( and therefore pro@@ trac@@ ted ) unemployment ; safely de-@@ leverage over-@@ in@@ deb@@ ted balance sheets ; and prevent al@@ read@@ y-@@ distur@@ bing income and wealth inequalities from growing worse .
the private sector alone cannot and will not counter the risk of st@@ all speed .
what is desper@@ ately needed is better policy@@ making .
specifically , policymakers must be open and willing to understand the unusual challenges facing the us economy , react accordingly , and possess sufficiently po@@ tent policy instruments .
unfortunately , this has been far from the case in ameri@@ ca ( and in europ@@ e , where the situation is worse ) .
moreover , us policymakers in the last few weeks have been more interested in pointing fin@@ gers at europ@@ e and ch@@ ina than in recogni@@ zing and responding to the para@@ dig@@ m shi@@ fts that are at the root of the country ’ s economic problems and mounting social challenges .
this is where the in@@ sights of ste@@ ve jobs , one of the world ’ s best innov@@ ators and entrepreneurs , come in .
jobs did more than navig@@ ate para@@ dig@@ m shi@@ fts ; he essentially created them .
he was a master at conver@@ ting the complicated into the simple ; and , rather than being par@@ aly@@ zed by complexity , he found new ways to de@@ construct and overcome it .
and he es@@ che@@ wed the search for the single “ big b@@ ang ” in favor of aiming for multiple break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
underlying it all was a willingness to evol@@ ve – a drive for perfec@@ tion through experi@@ mentation .
moreover , he excell@@ ed at selling to audi@@ ences worldwide both his vision and his strategy for re@@ alizing it .
rather than commit@@ ting to a comprehensive set of ur@@ gent@@ ly-@@ needed reinforcing measures , they seem ob@@ s@@ essed with the fu@@ tile search for the one “ kil@@ ler app ” that will solve all of the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economic problems .
no surprise that they have yet to find it .
te@@ am@@ work has repeatedly fallen ho@@ stage to tur@@ f wars and political bi@@ ck@@ ering .
little has been done to de@@ construct structural complexity , let alone win sufficient public support for a medium-term vision , a credible implementation strategy , and a set of measures that is adequate to the task at hand .
the longer the policy@@ making im@@ pas@@ se pers@@ ists , the greater the st@@ all-@@ speed risk for an economy that already has an unemployment crisis , a large budget deficit , many under@@ water mort@@ g@@ ages , and policy interest rates floo@@ red at zero .
this is an atmosphere in which un@@ healthy balance sheets come under even greater pressure , and healthy investors refuse to engage .
in the process , the risk of recession remains un@@ comfortably high , the unemployment crisis deep@@ ens , and in@@ equi@@ ties rise as al@@ read@@ y-@@ stret@@ ched social safety nets prove even more por@@ ous .
the us and ch@@ ina are the closest of enemies
ber@@ lin – there has long been talk that the strategic ri@@ val@@ ry emerging between the united states and ch@@ ina in recent years could one day give way to confron@@ tation .
that moment has arrived .
welcome to the cold war 2.0 .
the standard nar@@ r@@ ative about the sin@@ o-@@ ameri@@ can conflict is that it p@@ its two distinct systems against each other .
to the us , ch@@ ina is a big@@ -@@ data dictatorship that has de@@ tained one million u@@ igh@@ urs in concentration camps , cra@@ cked down on ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans , cur@@ ta@@ iled civil rights , and destroyed the environment – all while building up its military and threatening ameri@@ ca ’ s regional allies .
in the view of many chin@@ ese , the us is an exp@@ on@@ ent of interven@@ tion@@ ism and imperi@@ alism , and the tru@@ mp administration ’ s trade war is merely the opening shot in a larger economic , military , and ideological contest for su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy .
the new sin@@ o-@@ ameri@@ can confron@@ tation is roo@@ ted not in the two countries ’ differences , but in their growing simil@@ arity .
ch@@ ina and ameri@@ ca used to be the y@@ in and yang of the global economy , with ameri@@ ca playing the role of consumer , and ch@@ ina that of manufacturer .
for years , ch@@ ina fun@@ n@@ eled its sur@@ pl@@ uses back into the purchase of us treas@@ ury bil@@ ls , thus under@@ writing ameri@@ can prof@@ lig@@ acy and for@@ ging a sym@@ bio@@ tic arrangement that the hist@@ orian ni@@ all fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has called “ ch@@ im@@ eri@@ ca . ”
with his “ made in ch@@ ina 20@@ 25 ” policy , chin@@ ese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping is moving his country up the global value chain , in the hope of becoming a world leader in artificial intelligence ( ai ) and other c@@ utt@@ ing-@@ edge technologies .
to that end , ch@@ ina has cur@@ ta@@ iled western companies ’ access to its markets , making it conditional on their transfer of technology and intellectual property to domestic “ partners . ”
at the same time that ch@@ ina has been re@@ ori@@ enting its econom@@ ic-@@ development model , the us has replaced its traditional la@@ isse@@ z-@@ faire approach with an industrial strategy of its own .
behind tru@@ mp ’ s trade war is a desire to re@@ balance the economic playing field and “ dec@@ ou@@ ple ” the us from ch@@ ina .
and with both countries now locked in a zer@@ o-@@ sum competition , team g@@ af@@ am ( goo@@ gle , app@@ le , fac@@ ebook , amaz@@ on , micro@@ soft ) and team bat@@ x ( ba@@ i@@ du , ali@@ bab@@ a , ten@@ cent , xi@@ a@@ om@@ i ) are w@@ aging a war of technical know-how and data access on a global scale .
yet by trying to out@@ compete each other in the same areas , the us and chin@@ ese strategies are becoming more alike .
in response to former us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s efforts to create a p@@ aci@@ fic@@ -@@ ri@@ m trade blo@@ c to contain ch@@ ina , x@@ i launched his belt and road initiative ( br@@ i ) , which is now being met by an ameri@@ can@@ -@@ led in@@ do-@@ p@@ aci@@ fic initiative under tru@@ mp .
the two countries are also on similar paths milit@@ arily .
though ch@@ ina still has a lot of cat@@ ching up to do , its total defense spending is already second only to the us .
it has built and launched its first aircraft carrier , and has plans to launch more .
and by establishing its first overseas military base in d@@ ji@@ b@@ out@@ i , it has sign@@ aled that it has global – not merely regional – ambitions .
ch@@ ina and the us also increasingly share a pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction for interven@@ tion@@ ism .
for ch@@ ina , this represents a stark break from decades of treating non-@@ intervention as a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ religious doc@@ tr@@ ine .
but ch@@ ina ’ s changing attitude makes sense .
as yan x@@ u@@ et@@ ong of t@@ sin@@ gh@@ ua university explained to me shortly after the us invasion of i@@ ra@@ q , a country ’ s support for intervention reflects a recognition of its own power .
he predic@@ ted that as ch@@ ina built up its military forces , it would become more open to ex@@ er@@ ting its influence abroad .
chin@@ ese citizens and many others around the world now expect precisely that .
after ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ating hundreds of its citizens from li@@ b@@ ya in 2014 , ch@@ ina increased its participation in united nations peac@@ e-@@ keeping missions .
and , following a series of attacks in pak@@ istan , it created a special security force ( mostly of private contrac@@ tors ) to protect chin@@ ese interests along the “ new sil@@ k road ” of br@@ i projects .
another area of sin@@ o-@@ ameri@@ can convergence concerns the multilateral system .
in his 2005 “ responsible stakehol@@ der ” speech , th@@ en-@@ us dep@@ uty secret@@ ary of state ro@@ bert zo@@ el@@ lick told the west that glob@@ al-@@ governance institutions must include ch@@ ina or risk being over@@ turned .
but to the chin@@ ese , international engagement was never a bin@@ ary choice .
so , rather than becoming a responsible stakehol@@ der in the us-@@ led order , ch@@ ina is now developing what might be described as internation@@ alism with chin@@ ese characteristics .
accordingly , ch@@ ina has taken advantage of membership in west@@ ern@@ -@@ dominated institutions while simultaneously def@@ ang@@ ing them and building a parallel system of its own .
but , as the structure of the br@@ i shows , the world order ch@@ ina en@@ visions is based not on multilater@@ alism , but on bilateral relations between countries .
by dealing with other governments one on one , ch@@ ina can negotiate from a position of strength and impose its own terms .
tru@@ mp ’ s “ ameri@@ ca first ” doc@@ tr@@ ine em@@ bodies the same vision for the us .
both he and x@@ i have embra@@ ced a message of national re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation .
this has led x@@ i to replace ch@@ ina ’ s long@@ standing foreign@@ -@@ policy of moder@@ ation and tac@@ tical cooperation with one based on the pursuit of national great@@ ness .
and both leaders have increasingly taken foreign@@ -@@ policy decisions into their own hands , while under@@ cutting their respective countries ’ systems of checks and balances .
although “ cold war 2.0 ” does not feature the same clas@@ h of ut@@ op@@ ian ide@@ ologies as the original , the met@@ aph@@ or is fitting nonetheless .
like its predec@@ essor , this one will feature two super@@ powers that disagree on how the world should be organized , but agree that there can be only one winner .
ameri@@ ca , ch@@ ina , and the productivity parado@@ x
new haven – in the late 1980s , there was intense debate about the so-called productivity parado@@ x – when massive investments in information technology ( it ) were not delivering meas@@ ure@@ able productivity improvements .
that parado@@ x is now back , posing a problem for both the united states and ch@@ ina – one that may well come up in their annual strategic and economic dialogue .
back in 1987 , no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate ro@@ bert sol@@ ow fam@@ ously qui@@ pped , “ you can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics . ” the productivity parado@@ x seemed to be resolved in the 1990s , when ameri@@ ca experienced a spectacular productivity ren@@ a@@ issance .
average annual productivity growth in the country ’ s non@@ farm business sector accelerated to 2.5 % from 1991 to 2007 , from the 1.5 % trend in the prec@@ eding 15 years .
the benefits of the internet age had finally materi@@ alized .
concern about the parado@@ x all but van@@ ished .
but the celebration appears to have been pre@@ mature .
despite another technological revolution , productivity growth is sl@@ um@@ ping again . and this time the down@@ turn is global in scope , affecting the world ’ s two largest economies , the us and ch@@ ina , most of all .
over the past five years , from 2010 to 2014 , annual us productivity growth has fallen to an average of 0.@@ 9 % .
it actually fell at a 2.6 % annual rate in the two most recent quarters ( in late 2014 and early 2015 ) .
bar@@ ring a major data revision , ameri@@ ca ’ s productivity ren@@ a@@ issance seems to have run into serious trouble .
ch@@ ina is witness@@ ing a similar pattern .
although the government does not publish regular productivity statistics , there is no mis@@ taking the problem : overall urban employment growth has been steady , at around 13.@@ 2 million workers per year since 2013 – well in excess of the government ’ s targeted growth rate of ten million .
moreover , h@@ iring seems to be holding at that br@@ isk pace in early 2015 .
at the same time , output growth has s@@ lowed from the 10 % trend of the 33 years ending in 2011 to around 7 % today .
that down@@ shift , in the face of sustained rapid job creation , implies an un@@ mis@@ tak@@ able dec@@ eler@@ ation of productivity .
ther@@ ein lies the latest parado@@ x .
with revolutionary technologies now driving the creation of new markets ( digital media and computer@@ ized we@@ ar@@ ables ) , services ( energy management and d@@ na sequ@@ encing ) , products ( sm@@ art@@ phones and ro@@ bo@@ tics ) , and technology companies ( ali@@ bab@@ a and app@@ le ) , surely productivity growth must be sur@@ ging .
as a modern@@ -@@ day sol@@ ow might say , the � � � internet of everything ” is everywhere except in the productivity statistics .
but is there really a parado@@ x ?
nor@@ th@@ western university ’ s ro@@ bert g@@ ord@@ on has argued that it@@ - and intern@@ et-@@ led innovations like automated high-speed data processing and e-commerce p@@ ale in comparison to the break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s of the industrial revolution , including the steam engine , electricity , and indoor pl@@ umb@@ ing .
he maintains that , although these innovations led to dramatic transform@@ ations of the major advanced economies – such as higher female lab@@ or-@@ force participation , increased transportation speed , ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation , and norm@@ alized temperature control – these changes will be extremely hard to rep@@ licate .
indeed , as taken with today ’ s revolutionary technologies as we are – i say this star@@ ing at my sle@@ ek new app@@ le watch – i am sympa@@ thetic to g@@ ord@@ on ’ s argument .
if us productivity figures are to be taken at anything close to face value – a persist@@ ently s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish trend inter@@ rupted by a 16-@@ year sp@@ urt that now appears to have f@@ aded – it is possible that all ameri@@ ca has accomplished are transitional efficiency improvements associated with the it-@@ enabled shift from one technology platform to another .
optim@@ ists maintain that the official statistics fail to capture marked qualit@@ y-@@ of-@@ life improvements , which may be true , especially in the light of promising advances in biotechnology and online education .
but this over@@ looks a much more important aspect of the produc@@ tiv@@ ity-@@ measurement critique : the under@@ counting of work time associated with the widespread use of portable information app@@ liances .
in the us , the bure@@ au of labor statistics estimates that the length of the average work@@ week has held steady at about 34 hours since the adv@@ ent of the internet two decades ago .
yet nothing could be further from the truth : knowledge workers continually to@@ il outside the traditional office , checking their email , updating spre@@ ad@@ sheets , writing reports , and engaging in collective bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming .
indeed , wh@@ it@@ e-@@ col@@ lar knowledge workers – that is , most workers in advanced economies – are now te@@ ther@@ ed to their work@@ places essentially 24 hours a day , seven days a week , a reality that is not reflected in the official statistics .
productivity growth is not about working longer ; it is about generating more output per unit of labor input .
any under@@ counting of output p@@ ales in comparison with the it-@@ assisted under@@ counting of working hours .
ch@@ ina ’ s productivity slow@@ down is probably more ben@@ ign .
it is an out@@ growth of the chin@@ ese economy ’ s nas@@ cent structural transformation from capital@@ -@@ intensive manufacturing to lab@@ or-@@ intensive services .
indeed , it was only in 2013 that services sup@@ plan@@ ted manufacturing and construction as the economy ’ s largest sector .
now the gap is wi@@ dening , and that is likely to continue .
with chin@@ ese services requiring about 30 % more workers per unit of output than manufacturing and construction , combined , the economy ’ s structural re@@ balancing is now shi@@ fting growth to ch@@ ina ’ s lower@@ -@@ productivity services sector .
ch@@ ina has time before this becomes a problem .
as g@@ ord@@ on notes , there have been long-@@ lasting productivity divi@@ den@@ ds associated with ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation – a trend that could continue for at least another decade in ch@@ ina .
but there will come a time when this tail@@ wind sub@@ sides and ch@@ ina begins to conver@@ ge on the so-called frontier of the advanced economies .
at that point , ch@@ ina will face the same productivity challenges that confront ameri@@ ca and others .
chin@@ ese policymakers ’ new focus on innov@@ ation-@@ led growth seems to recognize this risk .
without powerful innovations , su@@ sta@@ ining productivity growth will be an u@@ phil@@ l battle .
ch@@ ina ’ s recent shift to a slo@@ wer@@ -@@ productivity tra@@ jec@@ tory is an early warning of what may well be one of its most da@@ un@@ ting economic challenges .
there is no escap@@ ing the key role that productivity growth plays in any country ’ s economic performance .
yet , for advanced economies , periods of sustained rapid productivity growth have been the exception , not the rule .
recent signs of s@@ lowing productivity growth in both the us and ch@@ ina under@@ score this reality .
for a world fli@@ r@@ ting with sec@@ ular stag@@ nation , that is distur@@ bing news , to say the least .
a bilateral fo@@ il for ameri@@ ca ’ s multilateral di@@ lemma
new haven – the good news is that the united states and ch@@ ina appear to have backed away from the pre@@ cip@@ ice of a trade war .
while v@@ ague in detail , a may 19 agreement def@@ uses tension and comm@@ its to further negotiation .
the bad news is that the framework of negotiations is fla@@ wed : a deal with any one country will do little to resolve ameri@@ ca ’ s fundamental economic imbalances that have ar@@ isen in an inter@@ connected world .
there is a long@@ standing dis@@ connect between bilateral and multilateral approaches to international economic problems .
in may 1930 , some 1,@@ 0@@ 28 of ameri@@ ca ’ s leading academic economists wrote a public letter to us president her@@ bert ho@@ over ur@@ ging him to ve@@ to the pending smo@@ o@@ t-@@ ha@@ wle@@ y tariff bill .
ho@@ over ignored the advice , and the global trade war that followed made a gar@@ den-@@ variety de@@ pression “ great . ”
president don@@ ald tru@@ mp has put a comparable sp@@ in on what it takes to “ make ameri@@ ca great again . ”
politicians have long favo@@ red the bilateral perspective , because it simpli@@ fies blame : you “ solve ” problems by targeting a specific country .
by contrast , the multilateral approach appe@@ als to most economists , because it stresses the bal@@ ance-@@ of-@@ payments distortions that arise from mis@@ matches between saving and investment .
this contrast between the simple and the complex is an obvious and important reason why economists often lose public debates .
the dis@@ mal science has never been known for clarity .
such is the case with the us-@@ ch@@ ina debate .
ch@@ ina is an easy political target .
after all , it accoun@@ ted for 46 % of ameri@@ ca ’ s colo@@ ss@@ al $ 800 billion merch@@ and@@ ise trade gap in 2017 .
moreover , ch@@ ina has been charged with eg@@ regi@@ ous violations of international rules , ranging from alleg@@ ations of currency manipulation and state-@@ subsidi@@ zed dumping of excess capacity to cy@@ ber-@@ h@@ acking and forced technology transfer .
equally significant , ch@@ ina has lost the battle in the arena of public opinion – ch@@ asti@@ sed by western policymakers , a few high-@@ profile academ@@ ics , and others for having failed to live up to the grand bar@@ gain struck in 2001 , when the country was admitted to the world trade organization .
a recent article in foreign affairs by two senior officials in the ob@@ ama administration says it all : “ ( t ) he liberal international order has failed to l@@ ure or bin@@ d ch@@ ina as power@@ fully as expected . ” as is the case with north korea , sy@@ ria , and ir@@ an , strategic pati@@ ence has given way to imp@@ ati@@ ence , with the nation@@ alistic tru@@ mp administration leading the charge against ch@@ ina .
the counter-@@ argument from multilater@@ al-@@ focused economists like me r@@ ings hol@@ low in this climate .
trac@@ ing out@@ size curr@@ ent-@@ account and trade deficits to an extraordinary short@@ fall of us domestic saving – just 1.3 % of national income in the fourth quarter of 2017 – counts for little in the arena of popular opinion .
likewise , it doesn ’ t help when we emphasize that ch@@ ina is merely a large piece of a much bigger multilateral problem : the us had bilateral merch@@ and@@ ise trade deficits with 102 countries in 2017 .
nor does it matter when we point out that correc@@ ting for sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ chain distortions – caused by in@@ puts from other countries that enter into chin@@ ese assembly platforms – would reduce the bilateral us-@@ ch@@ ina trade im@@ balance by 3@@ 5-@@ 40 % .
fla@@ wed as it may be , the bilateral political case res@@ on@@ ates in a us where there is enormous pressure to ease the ang@@ st of the country ’ s bele@@ agu@@ ered middle class .
trade deficits , goes the argument , lead to job losses and wage compres@@ sion .
and , with the merch@@ and@@ ise trade gap hit@@ ting 4.@@ 2 % of g@@ d@@ p in 2017 , these pressures have only intensi@@ fied in the current economic recovery .
as a result , targeting ch@@ ina has enormous political appeal .
so , what can be made of the may 19 deal ?
beyond a ceas@@ e@@ fire in ti@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ tat tariffs , there are few real benefits .
us negoti@@ ators are fix@@ ated on targeted reductions of around $ 200 billion in the bilateral trade im@@ balance over a two-@@ year time frame .
given the extent of ameri@@ ca ’ s multilateral problem , this is largely a meaning@@ less objective , especially in light of the massive and ill-@@ tim@@ ed tax cuts and federal expenditure increases that the us has en@@ acted in the last six months .
indeed , with budget deficits likely to wi@@ den , ameri@@ ca ’ s saving short@@ fall will only deep@@ en in the years ahead .
that points to rising bal@@ ance-@@ of-@@ payments and multilateral trade deficits , which are impossible to resolve through targeted bilateral actions against a single country .
chin@@ ese negoti@@ ators are more circum@@ spec@@ t , resist@@ ing num@@ eri@@ cal deficit targets but commit@@ ting to the joint objective of “ effective measures to substantially reduce ” the bilateral im@@ balance with the us .
ch@@ ina ’ s v@@ ague promise to purchase more ameri@@ can@@ -@@ made agricultural and energy products borro@@ ws a page from the “ shopping list ” approach of its earlier trade missions to the us .
unfortunately , the big@@ -@@ wal@@ let min@@ d@@ set of a de@@ al-@@ hung@@ ry ch@@ ina rein@@ forces the us nar@@ r@@ ative that ch@@ ina is guilty as charged .
even if the stars were in perfect align@@ ment and the us was not facing a saving constra@@ int , it stret@@ ches credibility to seek a formu@@ la@@ ic bilateral solution to ameri@@ ca ’ s multilateral problem .
since 2000 , the largest annual reduction in the us-@@ ch@@ ina merch@@ and@@ ise trade im@@ balance amoun@@ ted to $ 41 billion , and that occurred in 2009 , during the dep@@ ths of the great recession .
the goal of achieving back@@ -to-@@ back annual reductions total@@ ing more than double that mag@@ nit@@ ude is she@@ er fant@@ asy .
in the end , any effort to impose a bilateral solution on a multilateral problem will back@@ fire , with omin@@ ous consequences for ameri@@ can consumers .
without addressing the short@@ fall in domestic saving , the bilateral fix simply moves the deficit from one economy to others .
ther@@ ein lies the cru@@ el@@ est tw@@ ist of all .
ch@@ ina is ameri@@ ca ’ s low-@@ cost provider of imported consumer goods .
the tru@@ mp deal would shift the chin@@ ese piece of ameri@@ ca ’ s multilateral im@@ balance to hig@@ her@@ -@@ cost imports from elsewhere – the functional equivalent of a tax hi@@ ke on ameri@@ can families .
as ho@@ over ’ s g@@ host might ask , what ’ s so great about that ?
ameri@@ ca confron@@ ts old and new europ@@ e
us secret@@ ary of defense don@@ ald ru@@ ms@@ feld &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s pet@@ ul@@ ant re@@ mark of last year about &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; old and new europ@@ e &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; was right for the wrong reasons .
he meant it to refer to europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s divisions , but in may , ten additional states joined the europ@@ ean union .
the expanded europ@@ e truly forms a new europ@@ e .
should ameri@@ ca be ner@@ vous ?
fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ four years after the announcement of the sch@@ um@@ an plan that began to kn@@ it together the economies of fran@@ ce and ger@@ many , the eu now has 25 countries and a population larger than that of the united states .
eight of the new members are former communist countries that were locked behind the iron cur@@ tain for nearly half a century .
their attraction to the union is a sign of the appeal - the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; soft power &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; - of the idea of europ@@ ean unification .
of course , this new europ@@ e faces many problems .
the per capita income of the new countries is less than half of that of the fifteen members they are joining .
concerns have been raised about the influ@@ x of cheap labor .
but average g@@ d@@ p growth rates in the new members are twice as high as in the original members , and this can provide a welcome stimulus to stag@@ n@@ ant labor markets and s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish economies .
political arrangements are somewhat more problematic .
negotiations are underway to re@@ vise a draft eu constitution .
some europ@@ e@@ ans worry that the constitution will enable courts to carry the integration process further and faster than public opinion in member states will toler@@ ate .
lack of grass@@ roots support might lead to rejection of the constitution in countries like b@@ rit@@ ain , where refer@@ enda have been promised before the new arrangements come into force .
across the at@@ lan@@ tic , most ameri@@ cans ( to the extent they pay attention ) regard these changes with general approval .
but some express concern that the new europ@@ e will be defined in opposition to the us .
not only do the remarks of f@@ ren@@ ch leaders about recre@@ ating a multi-@@ pol@@ ar world ar@@ ouse alarm , but recent public opinion p@@ olls show a decline in the popularity of the us among europ@@ e@@ ans and a desire for more independent policies .
the i@@ ra@@ q war proved costly to ameri@@ can soft power , with the us losing about 30 percentage points of attra@@ cti@@ veness on average in europ@@ e , including in countries like b@@ rit@@ ain , sp@@ ain , and ital@@ y , whose governments supported the war .
the recent photographs of de@@ tain@@ ees being ab@@ used and sex@@ ually degra@@ ded in bag@@ h@@ dad &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ab@@ u gh@@ ra@@ i@@ b prison added fuel to the fire .
now some ameri@@ can neo-@@ con@@ servatives argue that the us should drop its long@@ standing support for europ@@ ean integration .
such a policy change would be a serious mistake .
not only would it add to anti-@@ ameri@@ can attitudes and fail to accompl@@ ish its objectives , but it over-@@ estimates the extent to which the new europ@@ e is being formed in opposition to the us .
whatever the rhetoric in fran@@ ce , for example , the policies and attitudes in countries such as b@@ rit@@ ain or pol@@ and demonstrate that good trans@@ -@@ at@@ lan@@ tic relations can be maintained .
if anything , the risks of a us-@@ europ@@ e split will be reduced rather than increased by the eu &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s recent enlargement .
moreover , there are several objective reasons why the current fri@@ ction between europ@@ e and the us is unlikely to lead to di@@ vor@@ ce .
for one thing , the di@@ visi@@ ve war in i@@ ra@@ q may turn out to be the last act of the twen@@ tieth century rather than a har@@ b@@ inger of the twenty-@@ first .
ameri@@ can unilater@@ alism is much less in evidence in the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s other hot spots , such as north korea and ir@@ an , both because of the costs of the war in i@@ ra@@ q and the realities of the situation in those other regions .
moreover , while the common security threat from the so@@ vi@@ et union has disappeared , both the us and europ@@ e face a new common threat from radical ji@@ ha@@ d@@ ist terrorism .
neither side of the at@@ lan@@ tic is imm@@ une to the threat , despite the efforts of o@@ sam@@ a bin laden to drive a we@@ dge between europ@@ e and ameri@@ ca .
transnational terrorism can only be confronted by close civilian cooperation such as intelligence sharing , police work across borders , and trac@@ ing financial flows .
these forms of cooperation survi@@ ved the divisions over i@@ ra@@ q .
europ@@ e and ameri@@ ca also share a common structure of economic interests and values .
while trade produces fri@@ c@@ tions in democracies , it also en@@ han@@ ces wealth .
if one looks at foreign direct investment , it is clear that the two sides of the at@@ lan@@ tic are closely integrated .
in terms of values , while some differences exist between europ@@ e and ameri@@ ca , at the fundamental level of democracy and human rights , no other two parts of the globe share more .
as the writer ro@@ bert k@@ ag@@ an concluded in the revision of his book in which he declared europ@@ e@@ ans to be from ven@@ us and ameri@@ cans from mar@@ s , it turns out that ameri@@ cans seeking democratic legitim@@ ization of their policies and self-@@ images cannot escape europ@@ e .
in short , it is good for ameri@@ cans - and for the world - that old and new europ@@ e are becoming one .
we can all benefit from the soft power of an enlarged europ@@ e .
ameri@@ ca embra@@ ces trade discrimination
new y@@ or@@ k – economists generally agree on the advantages of openness in trade .
but the case for non-discrimination in trade is also a comp@@ elling one .
so good trade policy should push for multilateral trade liberalization such as at the do@@ ha round , rather than preferential trade agreements ( pt@@ as ) such as free-@@ trade areas ( ft@@ as ) , and also ensure that any re@@ treat into protectionism does not de@@ generate into discriminatory trade practices .
the last g-@@ 20 meeting in can@@ ada was a dis@@ appointment on the first front .
at the insist@@ ence of the united states , an earlier reference by the g-@@ 20 to a definite date for completing the do@@ ha round was dropped .
instead , un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly rub@@ bing salt into the wo@@ und , president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama announced his administration ’ s willingness to see the us-@@ south korea ft@@ a through .
on the second front , there are dist@@ res@@ sing recent reports that the us commerce department is exploring ways to strengthen the b@@ ite of anti-@@ dumping actions , which are now generally agreed to be a form of discriminatory protectionism aimed selec@@ tively at successful exporting nations and firms .
equally dist@@ res@@ sing is ob@@ ama ’ s decision in aug@@ ust 13 to sign a bill , approved in a rare special session of the sen@@ ate , that raises visa fees on h@@ 1 ( b ) and l-@@ 1 temporary work visas in order to pay for higher bor@@ der-@@ enforcement expendi@@ tures .
this proposal gained its leg@@ s from long-@@ standing wor@@ ries about the h@@ 1 ( b ) and l-@@ 1 programs on the part of re@@ publi@@ can sen@@ ator ch@@ u@@ ck grass@@ ley and democratic sen@@ ator rich@@ ard dur@@ bin , and had recently attracted the spon@@ sor@@ ship of the influ@@ ential democratic sen@@ ator char@@ les sch@@ um@@ er of new y@@ or@@ k . sch@@ um@@ er had long ag@@ it@@ ated against “ out@@ sourcing ” as in@@ im@@ ical to ameri@@ can economic interests , even all@@ ying himself with the sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ side econom@@ ist pau@@ l cra@@ ig ro@@ ber@@ ts .
but he gained cl@@ out with the on@@ set of the current crisis , and concern over in@@ trac@@ table unemployment numbers is enabling politicians to justify all sorts of super@@ fici@@ ally attractive remedies .
thus , it was asser@@ ted that a tax on foreign workers would reduce the numbers coming in and “ taking jobs away ” from ameri@@ can citizens .
many supporters of the proposal claimed , in@@ coher@@ ently , that it would simultaneously dis@@ courage foreign workers from entering the us and increase revenues .
ob@@ ama ’ s s@@ urr@@ ender exemp@@ li@@ fied the doc@@ tr@@ ine that one re@@ treat often leads to another , with new lob@@ by@@ ists following in others ’ foot@@ steps .
perhaps the chief mistake , as with recent “ buy ameri@@ can ” provisions in us legislation , was to allow the employ ameri@@ can workers act ( e@@ a@@ wa ) to be fol@@ ded into the stimulus bill .
this makes it harder for companies to get governmental support to hire skilled immigrants with h@@ 1 ( b ) visas : they must first show that they have not laid off or plan to lay off ameri@@ can workers in similar occup@@ ations .
whatever the shortcomings of such measures in econom@@ ic-@@ policy terms , the vis@@ a-@@ fe@@ e-@@ enh@@ ancement provision is de facto discriminatory , and thus viol@@ ates w@@ to rules against discrimination between domestic and foreign firms , or between foreign firms from different w@@ to countries .
while the vis@@ a-@@ fee legislation is what lawyers call “ fac@@ i@@ ally ” non-@@ discriminatory , its design conf@@ ers an advantage on us firms vis-à-vis foreign firms .
the fee applies to both foreign and us firms that employ at least 50 workers , of which 50 % or more are h@@ 1 ( b ) workers .
but us firms have additional access to foreign workers under the immigration laws .
indi@@ a would be the chief loser relative to us firms , and , with several si@@ ze@@ able firms , such as info@@ s@@ ys and wi@@ pro , adver@@ sely affected by the measure , it would also be the chief loser vis-à-vis smaller out@@ sourcing firms from other countries .
the indi@@ an government has lost no time in raising these objections – as well as the prospect of a formal w@@ to dispute settlement mechanism complaint .
such acts of discrimination in trade policies find succ@@ or in the media and in some of ameri@@ ca ’ s prominent think tanks .
for example , in the wake of the vast mis@@ ery brought by floo@@ ding to the people of pak@@ istan , the us and other governments have risen to the occasion with emergency aid .
but there have also been proposals to grant dut@@ y-@@ free access to pak@@ istan ’ s exports .
but this would be discriminatory toward developing countries that do not have dut@@ y-@@ free access , helping pak@@ istan at their expense .
aston@@ ish@@ ingly , n@@ ancy bir@@ ds@@ all of the center for global development , who favor@@ s such discrimination , even wrote cy@@ ni@@ cally and appro@@ v@@ ingly that such a policy “ would have little impact on us textile producers . ” unfortunately , major us media , including the new y@@ or@@ k times and the wall street journ@@ al , have endorsed this de@@ pl@@ orable ass@@ ault on whatever non-discrimination remains in the world trading system .
is it too un@@ realistic to hope that the ob@@ ama administration , which has so far been far too respon@@ sive to weak economics and strong politics , will stand up to these demands ?
the us is exporting o@@ bes@@ ity
cam@@ bridge – as us president don@@ ald tru@@ mp ’ s administration thro@@ ws sharp el@@ bo@@ ws in trade negotiations and systematically res@@ cin@@ ds regulations introduced by president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama , one cas@@ u@@ alty is likely to be efforts to fight the global o@@ bes@@ ity epide@@ mic .
left un@@ checked , rapidly rising o@@ bes@@ ity rates could slow or even reverse the dramatic gains in health and life expec@@ tan@@ cy that much of the world has enjoyed over the past few decades .
and by forcing its food culture on countries like m@@ ex@@ ico and can@@ ada , the united states is making the problem worse .
one of the parado@@ xes of modern global capitalism is that whereas more than 800 million people in the world do not have enough to eat , an estimated 700 million people ( including 100 million children ) are o@@ bes@@ e .
of course , the two are not necessarily directly related .
a considerable proportion of world hunger occurs in countries suffering from domestic stri@@ fe or severe government d@@ ys@@ function .
the o@@ bes@@ ity epide@@ mic , however , has a much broader foot@@ print , affecting advanced economies and most emerging markets .
although there is some connection between o@@ bes@@ ity and poverty within countries , it is notable that o@@ bes@@ ity rates in rich countries such as the united states , the united king@@ dom , and can@@ ada are among the world ’ s highest .
recently , the us centers for disease control estimated that a stunning 40 % of all ameri@@ cans are o@@ bes@@ e ( defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher ) , a figure that includes 20.@@ 6 % of ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents ( 12-@@ 19 years old ) .
according to the c@@ d@@ c , the average weight of an ameri@@ can woman today is greater than the average weight of an ameri@@ can man in 1960 ( 16@@ 6 po@@ unds , or 75 kil@@ os ) .
back in 1960 , the average weight of an ameri@@ can woman was 140 po@@ unds , while the average weight of an ameri@@ can man today is 19@@ 5 po@@ unds .
( over the same period , the average height of ameri@@ cans increased by only one inch , or 2.5 c@@ enti@@ meters . )
this same dynamic is playing out worldwide , with o@@ bes@@ ity rates so@@ aring in europ@@ e , l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , and even in ch@@ ina .
although it is difficult to gau@@ ge the long-@@ run health consequences , there is abund@@ ant evidence that o@@ bes@@ ity contributes significantly to higher rates of type ii di@@ abetes , heart attacks , and certain types of cancer .
the health costs are stag@@ gering , estimated to be close to $ 200 billion per year in the us alone .
and with rising childhood o@@ bes@@ ity rates worldwide por@@ ten@@ ding significantly greater health problems in the future adult population , the costs are likely to rise considerably .
the causes of o@@ bes@@ ity are mani@@ fold and complex .
nevertheless , a growing body of evidence suggests that a culture empha@@ si@@ zing processed food and a generally se@@ dent@@ ary lifestyle lies at the center of the problem .
in emerging markets , rapid ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation is another important factor , as well as a desire to em@@ ul@@ ate western lifest@@ y@@ les .
many governments have launched initiatives to improve nutrition education .
unfortunately , industry advertising typically d@@ war@@ fs these efforts , as do us trade lob@@ by@@ ists ’ own efforts to push processed and fast food on the rest of the world .
it is hard to ignore the fact that m@@ ex@@ ico ’ s adult o@@ bes@@ ity rate has so@@ ared since the adoption in 1993 of the north ameri@@ can free trade agreement .
while there are many causes , post-@@ n@@ af@@ ta direct foreign investment in the processed food industry and a sur@@ ge in advertising are important contribut@@ ors .
m@@ exi@@ can consumption of sug@@ ary beverages nearly tri@@ pled between 1993 and 2014 , and a new tax on sug@@ ary drinks has mut@@ ed demand only slightly since then .
the other n@@ af@@ ta partner , can@@ ada , has simil@@ arly experienced a rise in o@@ bes@@ ity , partly because us imports have led to a sharp decline in the price of fru@@ c@@ to@@ se .
it is unfortunate that government regulators have been so slow to try to reverse these trends by , for example , helping to educ@@ ate the public on the science of nutrition .
and , for too long , most government anti-@@ o@@ bes@@ ity education has focused on mechan@@ ically regulating cal@@ orie in@@ take , without taking into account that different foods have dramatically different effects on appe@@ ti@@ te ( as da@@ vi@@ d lu@@ d@@ wig , a professor at har@@ v@@ ard medical school , empha@@ sizes in his excellent new book always hung@@ ry ) .
skep@@ tics may point out that nutrition guidelines always seem to be mor@@ ph@@ ing , with last year ’ s sin food becoming this year ’ s super@@ food , and vice vers@@ a .
though there is some truth to this , the fact is that nutrition research has made significant progress in recent decades .
the government has other tools at its disposal , besides education , for affecting people ’ s eating hab@@ its .
they can and should place greater restrictions on advertising to children , as the uk , fran@@ ce , and several other countries have done ; o@@ bes@@ ity in early years can lead to lifelong problems .
beyond that , lu@@ d@@ wig , tu@@ fts university ’ s dar@@ i@@ ush mo@@ z@@ aff@@ arian , and i have proposed in@@ stit@@ uting a tax on processed food , much the same way that tobacco is tax@@ ed .
proce@@ eds from the tax could be used to subsidi@@ ze health@@ ier alternatives .
but that is all the more reason why countries entering new trade agreements with the us ( for example , the post-@@ bre@@ x@@ it uk , or post-@@ n@@ af@@ ta can@@ ada ) must be war@@ y of any provisions that tie their hands in the war against o@@ bes@@ ity .
why “ ameri@@ ca first ” means “ europ@@ e united ”
br@@ ussel@@ s – one of the main arguments made in support of the united king@@ dom ’ s withdrawal from the europ@@ ean union is that the uk will be able to negotiate better trade deals with other countries – and even with europ@@ e – if it is on its own .
according to bre@@ x@@ it@@ e@@ ers like bri@@ tish foreign secret@@ ary bor@@ is j@@ oh@@ n@@ son , because eu member states are too divided and consu@@ med by their own crises to defend the integrity of the europ@@ ean project , “ there is only one way to get the change we want – vote to leave the eu . ”
but with less than a year remaining until “ bre@@ x@@ it day ” – when the uk ’ s eu membership officially ends – it is clear that the bri@@ tish government ’ s hopes of divi@@ ding and con@@ qu@@ ering the eu economy have been d@@ ash@@ ed .
eu member states have remained impres@@ sively united throughout the bre@@ x@@ it negotiations .
and while bre@@ x@@ it itself is nothing to celebrate , the process has at least shown that europ@@ e is strongest when it is challeng@@ ed .
in fact , for many europ@@ e@@ ans , the eu seems to have returned from the dead .
slowly but surely , f@@ ren@@ ch president em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron and german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a merk@@ el – the blo@@ c ’ s two most powerful leaders – have shown signs of coming together to pursue long-@@ over@@ due eu@@ -@@ level reforms .
moreover , despite the formation of an anti-@@ establishment coalition government in ital@@ y , and the rise of popul@@ ist parties across europ@@ e , opinion p@@ olls suggest that support for the eu is now higher than it has been in decades .
according to a recent euro@@ barom@@ eter survey , if a referendum on eu membership were held today , 83 % of europ@@ e@@ ans would vote to remain in the blo@@ c ; and a record@@ -@@ high 60 % regard eu membership as a “ good thing ” for their country .
in other words , while popul@@ ism can certainly so@@ w political divisions within the eu , there is little evidence that bre@@ x@@ it itself has caused a dom@@ ino effect .
the bre@@ x@@ it ring@@ leader ni@@ gel far@@ age might like to think that ital@@ y ’ s new popul@@ ist government represents a success for his brand of go@@ -@@ it-@@ alone nation@@ alism , but it turns out that europ@@ e ’ s popul@@ ists are of a different bre@@ ed than those in the uk .
though financial markets have grown sk@@ it@@ tish at the prospect that ital@@ y ’ s new leaders could drive their country out of the eurozone , poll@@ ing conducted after the election in mar@@ ch showed that 6@@ 0-@@ 72 % of itali@@ ans would not support such a move .
still , recent poll@@ ing does reveal more ambi@@ val@@ ence about the eu ’ s current tra@@ jec@@ tory .
just 32 % of citizens believe that “ things are going in the right direction ” for the eu , whereas 42 % think the blo@@ c is on the wrong path .
the question for most europ@@ e@@ ans , then , is not whether to destroy the eu , but how to improve it .
owing to the ling@@ ering effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent eurozone crisis , the eu has failed to implement necessary reforms .
but now it has a window of opportunity to act , because the truth about europ@@ e ’ s dangerous new geo@@ political reality is finally hit@@ ting home for many in the eu .
after all , the uni@@ fying challenge that bre@@ x@@ it has posed to the blo@@ c p@@ ales in comparison to that presented by don@@ ald tru@@ mp .
the us president ’ s dis@@ da@@ in for nat@@ o , and the re@@ vel@@ ations about his campaign ’ s contacts with kre@@ m@@ lin@@ -@@ connected rus@@ si@@ ans prior to the 2016 election , have made it abund@@ antly clear that europ@@ e@@ ans can no longer rely exclusively on the united states for their security .
moreover , tru@@ mp ’ s decision to subject the eu ( as well as other us allies such as can@@ ada and m@@ ex@@ ico ) to import tariffs on steel and al@@ umin@@ um has unified europ@@ ean leaders in ou@@ tra@@ ge and dis@@ g@@ ust .
and his suggestion that german cars should be clean@@ sed from us streets – despite the fact that many “ german ” cars are actually built in the very us states from which he draws his support – may help ger@@ mans realize that they need other europ@@ e@@ ans ’ help to protect their auto industry .
tru@@ mp ’ s tariffs have thus provided a perfect opportunity for ger@@ many ’ s gr@@ and-@@ coalition government to meet mac@@ ron hal@@ f@@ way on his ambitious proposals to reform the eu and the eurozone .
it is time for ger@@ many to be more open-@@ minded about the needs of southern europ@@ ean countries .
tru@@ mp ’ s “ ameri@@ ca first ” policies represent a mis@@ guided return to the n@@ aked nation@@ alism and protectionism of a by@@ gone era .
they pose a direct threat to the post-@@ war international order that has underp@@ inn@@ ed prosperity and stability for 73 years .
and yet they could also be just what the long-@@ stag@@ n@@ ant europ@@ ean integration process needs .
tru@@ mp re@@ vels in the cha@@ os he so@@ ws .
he regards international relations as a zer@@ o-@@ sum game of winners and lo@@ sers , and , to the extent that his foreign and trade policies make any sense at all , they are trans@@ ac@@ tional .
by contrast , the eu ’ s modus oper@@ and@@ i is one of collaboration and compromise .
and now that these two wor@@ ld@@ views are col@@ li@@ ding , each is likely to be em@@ bol@@ dened .
in addition to bre@@ x@@ it and tru@@ mp , rus@@ sian president v@@ ladimir pu@@ tin ’ s re@@ van@@ ch@@ ism and ch@@ ina ’ s growing asser@@ tiveness are up@@ ending the global order .
but , as we europ@@ e@@ ans well know , there is nothing like a crisis to get things moving again .
we have avoided tough decisions for decades .
now , we must decide what we want europ@@ e to be in 2050 , and beyond .
lon@@ don – as us president tru@@ mp stru@@ gg@@ les to staff his administration with sym@@ path@@ iz@@ ers who will help transpose t@@ we@@ ets into policy , the exo@@ dus of ob@@ ama appoin@@ tees from the federal government and other agencies continues .
for the financial world , one of the most significant depar@@ tures was that of dan@@ iel tar@@ ul@@ lo , the federal reserve govern@@ or who has led its work on financial regulation for the last seven years .
it would be a stretch to say that tar@@ ul@@ lo has been univers@@ ally popular in the banking community .
he led the charge in argu@@ ing for much higher capital rati@@ os , in the united states and elsewhere .
he was a tough negoti@@ ator , with a well-@@ tun@@ ed inst@@ inc@@ t for spot@@ ting special ple@@ ading by financial firms .
but cro@@ codi@@ le te@@ ars will be shed in europ@@ e to mark his re@@ sign@@ ation .
europ@@ ean banks , and even their regulators , were concerned by his enthusi@@ astic advoc@@ acy of even tou@@ gher standards in bas@@ el 3.5 ( or bas@@ el 4 , as ban@@ kers like to call it ) , which would , if implemented in the form favo@@ red by the us , require further substantial capital increases for europ@@ e ’ s banks in particular .
in his absence , these proposals ’ fate is uncertain .
but tar@@ ul@@ lo has also been an enthusi@@ astic promo@@ ter of international regulatory cooperation , with the frequent fl@@ yer miles to prove it .
for some years , he has chaired the financial stability board ’ s lit@@ t@@ le-@@ known but important standing committee on supervisory and regulatory cooperation .
his commitment to working with colleagues in international bodies like the fs@@ b and the bas@@ el committee on banking supervision , to reach global regulatory agreements enabling banks to compete on a level playing field , has never been in doubt .
already , some of those who cri@@ tici@@ zed him most vo@@ cally in the past are anxi@@ ous about his departure .
who will succeed him ?
the 2010 do@@ d@@ d-@@ fran@@ k act created a vi@@ ce-@@ chair position on the federal reserve board – which has never been filled – to lead the fed ’ s work on regulation .
will that appoin@@ tee , whom tru@@ mp now needs to select , be as committed as tar@@ ul@@ lo to an international approach ?
or will his principal task be to build a regulatory wall , protecting us banks from global rules ?
we do not yet know the answers to these questions , but fed wat@@ chers were al@@ armed by a jan@@ u@@ ary 31 letter to fed chair jan@@ et y@@ ellen from representative patri@@ ck m@@ chen@@ ry , the vice chairman of the house committee on financial services .
m@@ chen@@ ry did not pull his pun@@ ches . “ despite the clear message delivered by president don@@ ald tru@@ mp in priori@@ tiz@@ ing ameri@@ ca ’ s interest in international negotiations , ” m@@ chen@@ ry wrote , “ it appears that the federal reserve continues negotiating international regulatory standards for financial institutions among global bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats in foreign lands without transparency , accountability , or the authority to do so .
this is unacceptable . ”
in her reply of f@@ ebru@@ ar@@ y@@ 10 , y@@ ellen firmly re@@ but@@ ted m@@ chen@@ ry ’ s arguments .
she pointed out that the fed does indeed have the authority it needs , that the bas@@ el agreements are not binding , and that , in any event , “ strong regulatory standards enhance the stability of the us financial system ” and promote the competitiveness of financial firms .
but that will not be the end of the story .
the battle lines are now drawn , and m@@ chen@@ ry ’ s letter shows the arguments that will be deployed in congress by some re@@ public@@ ans close to the president .
there has always been a strand of thinking in wash@@ ington that dis@@ li@@ kes foreign ent@@ ang@@ lements , in this and other areas .
while y@@ ellen ’ s arguments are correct , the fed ’ s entit@@ lement to participate in international negotiations does not ob@@ lige it to do so , and a new appoin@@ tee might argue that it should not .
such a re@@ versal would generate tensions within the fed , and where it would leave the fs@@ b , or indeed the bas@@ el committee , is un@@ clear .
in the early days of the bank for international settlements ( where the bas@@ el committee ’ s secret@@ ariat is located ) in the 19@@ 30@@ s , the us government declined to take a board seat , and the us was represented by j@@ p mor@@ gan .
it is a little hard to see that arrangement working well today .
these questions are of more than passing interest in europ@@ e .
europ@@ ean capital adequ@@ acy directives typically transpose bas@@ el acc@@ ords into eu law .
if the bas@@ el process st@@ alls , transatlantic deals , which are the crucial underp@@ inning of western capital markets , will be far harder to reach .
there is a further complic@@ ation arising from bre@@ x@@ it .
ab@@ sent any special deal between the eu@@ 27 and the united king@@ dom , bri@@ tish and eu regulators will come together in bas@@ el , not in the europ@@ ean banking authority .
if bas@@ el becomes a talking shop , without the ability to set firm standards , another key link in the chain will be broken , and it will be harder for the uk to argue that if lon@@ don ’ s banks meet international standards , they should be granted equal treatment in the eu .

the financial world is holding its collective bre@@ ath .
why mill@@ enni@@ als will reject tru@@ mp
new y@@ or@@ k – the key political divide in the united states is not between parties or states ; it is between generations .
the mill@@ enni@@ al generation ( those aged 18-@@ 35 ) voted heavily against don@@ ald tru@@ mp and will form the back@@ bone of resistance to his policies .
older ameri@@ cans are divided , but tru@@ mp ’ s base lies among those above the age of 45 . on issue after issue , younger voters will reject tru@@ mp , viewing him as a politi@@ cian of the past , not the future .
of course , these are aver@@ ages , not absol@@ utes .
yet the numbers confirm the gener@@ ational divide .
according to exit p@@ olls , tru@@ mp received 53 % of the votes of those 45 and older , 42 % of those 30-@@ 44 , and just 37 % of voters 18-@@ 29 . in a 2014 survey , 31 % of mill@@ enni@@ als identified as liber@@ als , compared with 21 % of baby bo@@ om@@ ers ( aged 5@@ 0-@@ 68 in the survey ) and only 18 % of the silent generation ( 69 and above ) .
the point is not that today ’ s young liber@@ als will become tomorrow ’ s older con@@ servatives .
the mill@@ enni@@ al generation is far more liberal than the baby bo@@ om@@ ers and silent generation were in their younger years .
they are also deci@@ de@@ dly less parti@@ s@@ an , and will support politicians who address their values and needs , including third-@@ party aspir@@ ants .
there are at least three big differences in the politics of the young and old .
first , the young are more socially liberal than the older generations .
for them , ameri@@ ca ’ s growing ra@@ cial , religious , and sexual plur@@ ality is no big deal .
a diverse society of wh@@ ites , afri@@ can@@ -@@ ameri@@ cans , h@@ isp@@ an@@ ics , and asi@@ ans , and of the n@@ ativ@@ e-@@ born and immigrants , is the country they ’ ve always known , not some dramatic change from the past .
they accept sexual and gender categories – les@@ bian , ga@@ y , tran@@ s , bi , inter , p@@ an , and others – that were essentially t@@ abo@@ o for – or unknown to – their grand@@ parents ’ ( tru@@ mp ’ s ) generation .
second , the young are facing the unprecedented economic challenges of the information revolution .
they are entering the labor market at a time when market returns are rapidly shi@@ fting toward capital ( robots , artificial intelligence , and smart machines generally ) and away from labor .
the elderly rich , by contrast , are enjoying a stock market boom caused by the same technological revolution .
tru@@ mp is pe@@ dd@@ ling cuts in corporate taxes and estate taxes that would further benefit the elderly rich ( who are amp@@ ly represented in tru@@ mp ’ s cab@@ inet ) , at the expense of larger budget deficits that further burden the young .
indeed , the young need the opposite policy : higher taxes on the wealth of the older generation in order to finance post-@@ secondary education , job training , renew@@ ab@@ le-@@ energy infrastructure , and other investments in ameri@@ ca ’ s future .
third , compared to their parents and grand@@ parents , the young are much more aware of climate change and its threats .
while tru@@ mp is enti@@ cing the older generation with one last fl@@ ing with fossil fuels , the young will have none of it .
they want clean energy and will fight against the destruction of the earth that they and their own children will inher@@ it .
part of the gener@@ ational divide over global warming is due to the she@@ er ignor@@ ance of many older ameri@@ cans , including tru@@ mp , about climate change and its causes .
older ameri@@ cans didn ’ t learn about climate change in school .
they were never introduced to the basic science of greenhouse gases .
that is why they are ready to put their own short-term financial interests ahead of the di@@ re threats to their grand@@ children ’ s generation .
in a jun@@ e 2015 survey , 60 % of 18-@@ 29 year-@@ olds said that human activity was causing global warming , compared with just 31 % of those 65 and older . a survey released in jan@@ u@@ ary found that 38 % of ameri@@ can survey respon@@ dents 65 and older favo@@ red fossi@@ l-@@ fuel expansion over renewable energy , compared with only 19 % of those 18-@@ 29 .
tru@@ mp ’ s economic policies are geared to this older , wh@@ iter , n@@ ativ@@ e-@@ born ameri@@ ca .
he favor@@ s tax cuts for the older rich , which would burden the young with higher debt .
he is in@@ different to the $ 1 tril@@ lion over@@ hang of student debt .
he is re@@ pr@@ ising the 1990s n@@ af@@ ta debate over free trade , rather than facing the far more important twenty-@@ first-@@ century jobs challenge posed by ro@@ bo@@ tics and artificial intelligence .
and he is ob@@ s@@ essed with squ@@ ee@@ zing a few more years of profit out of ameri@@ ca ’ s coal , oil , and gas reserves at the cost of a future environmental catastro@@ phe .
one might attri@@ bute tru@@ mp ’ s back@@ war@@ d-@@ looking min@@ d@@ set to his age .
at 70 , tru@@ mp is the oldest person ever to become president ( ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an was slightly younger when he took office in 1981 ) .
yet age is hardly the sole or even the main factor here .
ber@@ nie s@@ anders , certainly the fresh@@ est mind of all the 2016 presidential candidates and the her@@ o of mill@@ enni@@ al voters , is 75 . the young are enchan@@ ted with pop@@ e fran@@ c@@ is , 80 , because he puts their concerns – whether about poverty , employment difficulties , or vulnerability to global warming – within a moral framework , rather than dis@@ missing them with the cr@@ ass cy@@ nic@@ ism of tru@@ mp and his il@@ k .
the main issue here is min@@ d@@ set and political orientation , not chron@@ ological age .
tru@@ mp has the shor@@ test time horiz@@ on ( and attention sp@@ an ) of any president in historical memory .
and he is utter@@ ly out of touch with the real challenges facing the young generation as they gra@@ pp@@ le with new technologies , shi@@ fting labor markets , and cr@@ ush@@ ing student debt .
a trade war with m@@ ex@@ ico and ch@@ ina , or a tra@@ gi@@ cally mis@@ conceived ban on mus@@ li@@ m migrants , will hardly meet their real needs .
tru@@ mp ’ s political success is a bli@@ p , not a turning point .
today ’ s mill@@ enni@@ als , with their fut@@ ure-@@ oriented perspective , will soon domin@@ ate ameri@@ can politics .
ameri@@ ca will be multi@@ ethnic , socially liberal , climate conscious , and much fairer in sharing the economic benefits of new technology .
too many observers remain fix@@ ated on the traditional party divi@@ des in the us congress , not on the deeper demographic changes that will soon be decisive .
s@@ anders nearly captured the democratic nom@@ ination ( and would likely have tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed in the general election ) with a platform appe@@ aling power@@ fully to the mill@@ enni@@ als .
their time is coming , most likely with a president they support in 2020 .
ameri@@ ca goes from teacher to student
cam@@ bridge -- as the united states ’ ep@@ ic financial crisis continues to un@@ fold , one can only wish that us policymakers were half as good at listening to advice from developing countries as they are at giving it .
ameri@@ cans don ’ t seem to realize that their “ sub-@@ prime ” mort@@ gage mel@@ t@@ down has all too much in common with many previous post-@@ 1945 banking crises throughout the world .
the silver lining is that there are many highly distinguished current and former policymakers out there , particularly from emerging market countries , who have seen this movie before .
if us policymakers would only listen , they might get an idea or two about how to deal with financial crises from experts who have lived through them and come out safely on the other side .
unfortunately , the parallel between today ’ s us crisis and previous financial crises is not mere hyper@@ b@@ ole .
the qualitative parall@@ els are obvious : banks using off-@@ balance loans to finance highly ris@@ ky vent@@ ures , exotic new financial instruments , and excessive ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ance over the promise of new markets .
but there are strong quantitative parall@@ els as well .
professor car@@ men rein@@ hart of the university of mar@@ y@@ land and i systematically compared the run@@ -up to the us sub-@@ prime crisis with the run@@ -up to the 19 worst financial crises in the industri@@ alized world over the past 60 years . these include ep@@ ic crises in the sc@@ andin@@ avian countries , sp@@ ain , and jap@@ an , along with less@@ er events such as the us savings and loan crises of the 1980 ’ s .
across virtually all the major indicators – including equity and housing price run@@ s-@@ ups , trade balance deficits , sur@@ ges in government and household in@@ deb@@ te@@ dness , and pre-@@ crisis growth tra@@ jec@@ tories – red lights are blin@@ king for the us .
simply put , sur@@ ging capital flows into the us arti@@ fici@@ ally held down interest rates and infl@@ ated asset prices , leading to la@@ xity in banking and regulatory standards and , ultimately , to a mel@@ t@@ down .
when a@@ sia and l@@ atin ameri@@ ca had their financial mel@@ t@@ down@@ s in the 1990 ’ s and early 2000 ’ s , they took advice not only from the im@@ f , but also from a number of small panels composed of emin@@ ent people representing diverse back@@ grounds and experiences .
the us should do the same .
the head of the im@@ f , f@@ ren@@ ch@@ man dom@@ ini@@ que str@@ aus@@ s-@@ k@@ ahn , could easily select a superb panel from any range of former crisis countries , including m@@ ex@@ ico , bra@@ zi@@ l , korea , tur@@ key , jap@@ an , and s@@ weden , not to mention ar@@ gent@@ ina , rus@@ sia , ch@@ ile , and many others .
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , the im@@ f ’ s panel would have to look past ameri@@ ca ’ s current hypo@@ cris@@ y .
the us treas@@ ury strongly encouraged a@@ sia to tigh@@ ten fiscal policy during its 1990 ’ s crisis .
but today the us congress and president are tri@@ pping over themselves to adopt an ill-@@ advised giant fiscal stimulus package , whose main effects will be to tie the hands of the next president in simplifying the us tax code and closing the budget deficit .
ameri@@ cans firmly told jap@@ an that the only way to clean up its economy was to pur@@ ge in@@ sol@@ vent banks and re@@ generate the financial system through sch@@ um@@ pe@@ ter@@ ian “ creative destruction . ”
today , us authorities appear willing to con@@ template any measure , no matter how infl@@ ation@@ ary , to ins@@ ure that none of its major banks and investment houses fails .
for years , foreign governments compla@@ ined about ameri@@ can he@@ dge funds , argu@@ ing that their non-@@ transparent behavior posed unacceptable risks to stability .
now , many us politicians are compla@@ ining about the transparency of sovereign wealth funds ( big government investors mainly from a@@ sia and the middle east ) , which are taking shares in tro@@ ph@@ y ameri@@ can assets such as ci@@ ti@@ bank and mer@@ ri@@ ll l@@ yn@@ ch .
in fact , having countries like rus@@ sia and ch@@ ina more vest@@ ed in the well-being of the us economy would not be a bad thing .
yes , the im@@ f ought to develop a voluntary code of conduct for sw@@ f ’ s , but it should not be used as a weapon to enforce financial protectionism .
for years , i , along with many others , have compla@@ ined that emerging markets need greater representation in global financial governance .
today , the issue goes far beyond symbol@@ ism .
the us economy is in trouble , and the problems it sp@@ ins off are unlikely to stop at the us border .
experts from emerging markets and elsewhere have much to say about dealing with financial crises .
ameri@@ ca should start to listen before it is too late .
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – former us secret@@ ary of the treas@@ ury law@@ r@@ ence h. summ@@ ers recently qui@@ pped that , “ fiscal stimulus is like a drug with tolerance effects ; to keep growth constant , deficits have to keep getting larger . ” people like summ@@ ers worry about deficits because they doubt that the money the government is borro@@ wing is being spent in ways that will push the long-term growth of g@@ d@@ p above that of the debt .
unless the mix of spending changes , the deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ g@@ d@@ p ratio will continue to grow , fore@@ telling disaster .
others do not share such concerns .
on the political left , no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate pau@@ l k@@ ru@@ g@@ man , for example , argu@@ es that for “ a country that looks like the united states , a debt crisis is fundamentally not possible . ”
on the right , j@@ oh@@ n tam@@ ny , for@@ bes ’ political economy editor , says , “ ignore the endless talk of do@@ om , budget deficits really don ’ t matter . ”
but while judgments differ about the sustainability of us government debt , they both accept the standard measure of it as accurate .
this is a mistake , and possibly a catastro@@ p@@ hic one .
the con@@ gres@@ sional budget office ( c@@ bo ) recently reported that the federal budget deficit in the first ten months of this fiscal year was $ 1@@ 16 billion higher than it was at the same time last year .
the c@@ bo is now projec@@ ting that the annual deficit will reach $ 1 tril@@ lion by 2020 .
this is worrying , but it does not reflect the har@@ sh truth .
to understand why , think of ameri@@ ca as a home with a le@@ ak@@ y roof .
if you wanted to sell that home to a buyer who is financing the purchase with a mort@@ gage , federal real-@@ estate law would require you to get an app@@ ra@@ is@@ al , which would show that the roof needs repa@@ irs .
in this scenario , your maintenance delays cannot be ignored .
the law requires that you disc@@ lose and pay for the hidden costs of repa@@ iring the roof .
otherwise , you are ste@@ aling from the buyer .
true , unlike the mort@@ gage on your balance sheet , you may not regard roof maintenance as a current liability .
but putting it off doesn ’ t make it disappear .
it is still a real debt – just one that has gone un@@ accoun@@ ted for .
the federal government also has debt that has not been accoun@@ ted for , and which one doesn ’ t often hear about .
the debt that has been accoun@@ ted for is the $ 15.@@ 6 tril@@ lion held by the public in the form of us treas@@ ury bonds .
the debts that have not been accoun@@ ted for include the de@@ fer@@ red costs of maintenance on roads , water systems , and 5@@ 4,@@ 5@@ 60 struc@@ tur@@ ally defici@@ ent bridges , as well as the y@@ et-@@ to-@@ be@@ -@@ built low-@@ carbon energy systems necessary to mitig@@ ate the catastro@@ p@@ hic effects of climate change .
and these are just two broad examples .
so , just how much hidden us debt is there ?
at this point , we must rely on rou@@ gh estimates .
for example , according to a 2016 report from the ameri@@ can society of civil engineers ( as@@ ce ) , upgrading the country ’ s cru@@ m@@ bling infrastructure would cost $ 5.@@ 2 tril@@ lion .
and , according to a 2014 international energy agency ( ie@@ a ) report and our own calculations based on the us share of global co@@ 2 emissions , transi@@ tioning to a cle@@ an-@@ energy system will cost an additional $ 6.@@ 6 tril@@ lion .
all told , that is $ 11.@@ 8 tril@@ lion in un@@ accoun@@ te@@ d-@@ for non-@@ infl@@ ation-@@ adjusted li@@ abilities .
to be sure , these debts are not solely federal li@@ abilities .
in the past , state and local governments were responsible for most infrastructure and climate costs .
however , already bur@@ dened with more than $ 3 tril@@ lion of municipal debt , state governments are overwhel@@ med by the scale of their de@@ fer@@ re@@ d-@@ maintenance li@@ abilities and the only recently documented costs of climate change ab@@ at@@ ement .
however , because climate change and infrastructure security are national issues , rather than local , the federal government is ultimately responsible for that $ 11.@@ 8 tril@@ lion in infra@@ struc@@ ture@@ - and environ@@ ment-@@ related debts .
they are ameri@@ ca ’ s national “ le@@ ak@@ y roof . ”
that figure increases every year , because as bridges continue to weak@@ en , it costs even more to fix them ; and as sea levels and temperatures continue to rise , and as forest fires become more severe , it costs more to mitig@@ ate the damage .
in fact , between 2012 and 2016 , the as@@ ce increased its estimate of ameri@@ ca ’ s annual infra@@ struc@@ tu@@ re-@@ investment gap by $ 2@@ 21 billion – about $ 55 billion per year .
and between 2012 and 2014 , the ie@@ a increased its estimated cost of moving to a cle@@ an-@@ energy system by roughly $ 2@@ 70 billion per year .
together , the un@@ accoun@@ te@@ d-@@ for infl@@ ation-@@ adjusted deficit amoun@@ ted to $ 3@@ 45 billion – just from dela@@ ying needed infrastructure and climate ab@@ at@@ ement spending .
the 2017 us federal deficit was $ 6@@ 65 billion , reflecting the amount by which debt that is actually accoun@@ ted for increased .
if infrastructure and climate debt that is not accoun@@ ted for were to be included , the all-@@ in deficit in 2017 would have been over $ 1 tril@@ lion .
yes , these are back@@ -@@ of-the-@@ envelop@@ e calculations , but they point to an urgent question : why isn ’ t the us counting its hidden debts ?
the short answer is that the law doesn ’ t require it .
the federal “ debt limit ” was never a firm construct , and under pressure it became a squ@@ ish@@ y “ ceiling suspension ” that allows the government to bor@@ row as much as it wants .
mean@@ while , a con@@ gres@@ sional rule that was intended to ensure fiscal responsibility by pro@@ hibit@@ ing deficit increases above $ 1.5 tril@@ lion within a ten-@@ year window has become an accounting tri@@ ck to escape responsibility for the 11@@ th year and beyond .
but just as we are ste@@ aling from the home@@ buyer if we do not disc@@ lose and pay for our le@@ ak@@ y roof , we are ste@@ aling from future generations of ameri@@ cans when we ignore the full extent of government li@@ abilities .
until all debt is counted , we cannot even begin to know whether fiscal policies are having positive or negative effects on future growth .
ameri@@ ca ’ s second chance with indi@@ a
new y@@ or@@ k – indi@@ an prime minister nar@@ en@@ dra mo@@ di ’ s visit to wash@@ ington , d@@ c , in jun@@ e gar@@ ner@@ ed little public attention outside of indi@@ a .
yet diplom@@ ats and military professionals in a@@ sia and beyond were certainly watching closely . for good reason : the rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement between the world ’ s two most popul@@ ous democracies could shape the world ’ s future .
it is worth no@@ ting that in his address to the us congress , mo@@ di invo@@ ked the word “ partner ” or “ partnership ” no fewer than 15 times .
the official joint statement released by the two governments described indi@@ a as a “ major defense partner ” of the united states , eligible for advanced technologies with military applications .
the relationship between indi@@ a and the us has evol@@ ved from one of cool distance to strategic proximity in a generation – ligh@@ tn@@ ing fast for geo@@ politics .
the factors underlying this shift mer@@ it attention , for many of them are likely to bring the two countries even closer .
the cold war ’ s end was a significant part of the bilateral rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement , because it eliminated the possibility of indi@@ a ’ s continued association with the so@@ vi@@ et union , as well as its r@@ ationale for embra@@ cing non-@@ align@@ ment .
a second factor is pak@@ istan .
nonetheless , during most of the cold war , pak@@ istan was seen as a friendly country , whereas its great rival , indi@@ a , was viewed as difficult .
this view was reinforced when pak@@ istan became the essential con@@ du@@ it of weapons to afgh@@ ans fighting the so@@ vi@@ et occupation of their country .
but the bond between the us and pak@@ istan weak@@ ened when so@@ vi@@ et forces with@@ drew from afgh@@ an@@ istan in 1989 .
relations suffered further from pak@@ istan ’ s development of nuclear weapons , its provision of sanc@@ tu@@ ary and support to the tali@@ ban , and its willingness to extend hospitality to some of the world ’ s most dangerous terrorists , including o@@ sam@@ a bin laden .
as a result , us ties to indi@@ a were no longer constra@@ ined by fear of comp@@ lications in pak@@ istan .
ch@@ ina is also anim@@ ating the improvement in indi@@ a-@@ us ties .
the motivation is far more fundamental than the fact that indi@@ a and ch@@ ina still have an un@@ resolved border .
ch@@ ina ’ s rise has created a strong incentive for countries with a stake in a@@ sia to increase their cooperation with the us , as well as with one another , to ensure that they can stand up to ch@@ ina ’ s political , military , and economic might .
domestic politics also lo@@ om large in the relationship ’ s development – on both sides .
the decline of indi@@ a ’ s congress party reduced the influence of the political force most associated with maintaining distance from the us .
mean@@ while , there are now more than three million indi@@ an-@@ ameri@@ cans , and , as with many other im@@ migrant populations , they have become ever more prominent and powerful .
supporting closer ties with indi@@ a has become a rare example of bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an us foreign policy , and it can be expected to continue regardless of which party controls the white house or congress after this nov@@ ember ’ s elections .
the break@@ through in bilateral ties came a decade ago , when the us li@@ fted sanctions introduced in response to indi@@ a ’ s nuclear weapons program and then signed an acc@@ ord p@@ aving the way for us involvement in indi@@ a ’ s civil nuclear energy program .
indi@@ a , unlike both pak@@ istan and north korea , is seen as a responsible nuclear power , a country the us now supports for membership in various groups designed to stem the further spread of nuclear materials and weapons .
economic ties are also growing , along with indi@@ a ’ s economy .
bilateral trade has increased to more than $ 100 billion a year .
high-level visits have become comm@@ on@@ place .
closer economic ties and large-scale collaboration on clean energy are a high priority .
one can also pre@@ dict increased cooperation between the two countries ’ military and intelligence establishments .
indeed , joint efforts to keep the indi@@ an ocean open and safe are already a reality .
the us and indi@@ a need not be formal allies for their relationship to have the desired effect on chin@@ ese strategic calculations .
challenges remain , of course .
bureaucracy , corruption , and poor infrastructure continue to hold back indi@@ a ’ s economy .
indi@@ an leaders must also be careful not to do or say things that could alien@@ ate the country ’ s large mus@@ li@@ m minority .
and they must still ensure that close ties with the us are not simply the policy of one prime minister or party .
this means getting the congress party fully on board and over@@ coming the resistance of career officials to new ways of thinking and acting .
it is difficult to over@@ look the ir@@ ony in much of this .
more than a half-@@ century ago , in the early years of the cold war , many in wash@@ ington saw indi@@ a as a potential model of non-@@ communist political and economic development .
for many reasons , things did not work out that way , as indi@@ a became economically st@@ ati@@ st , for a time politically author@@ itarian , and geo@@ politically closer to the uss@@ r than us officials liked .
now , however , indi@@ a is emerging as a successful example of a market-@@ oriented democracy with close ties to the us .
second chances are rare in life , but both indi@@ a and the us may be getting just that .
ameri@@ ca keeping ha@@ iti down
the id@@ b , the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s largest regional development bank , works in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca and the c@@ arib@@ bean pur@@ porte@@ dly to “ contribute to the acceler@@ ation of economic and social development . ”
its actions in ha@@ iti , however , have severely under@@ mined those goals .
roughly $ 54 million in id@@ b loans for water infrastructure in ha@@ iti , home to literally the world ’ s worst water , offered a proven path to preventing dead@@ ly water@@ -@@ borne diseases . designed to assist in fulfilling the right to water in the most im@@ pover@@ ished nation in the western h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , these loans and the lives they could have saved instead have become pa@@ wns in a deliber@@ ate political power play .
in 2001 , us officials threatened to use their influence to stop previously approved id@@ b funding unless ha@@ iti ’ s majority political party submitted to political demands to accept a particular ap@@ por@@ tion@@ ment of seats in a ha@@ iti@@ an electoral over@@ sight body .
soon after , at the be@@ h@@ est of the us , instead of dis@@ bur@@ sing the loans as planned , the id@@ b and its members took the unprecedented step of imp@@ lic@@ itly adding conditions to require political action by ha@@ iti before the funds would be released .
these actions viol@@ ated the id@@ b ’ s own charter , which strictly prohib@@ its the bank and its members from inter@@ fer@@ ing in the internal political affairs of member states .
internal em@@ ails reveal that a us legal coun@@ sel@@ or inside the id@@ b proposed to the us treas@@ ury department that , though the loans faced no legitimate technical obstacles , the us could effectively block them by “ s@@ lowing ” the process .
indeed , by requesting further review of the loans , ha@@ iti would have to make scheduled payments before the funds were even dis@@ bur@@ sed . “ while this is not a ‘ bul@@ le@@ t-@@ proof ’ way to stop id@@ b dis@@ bur@@ sements , ” the coun@@ s@@ ellor wrote , “ it certainly will put a few more large rocks in the road . ”
in 2001 , th@@ en-@@ us am@@ bassador to ha@@ iti de@@ an curr@@ an publicly and explicitly linked the with@@ holding of id@@ b loans to the demand that ha@@ iti ’ s political parties reach a compromise that ameri@@ ca wanted .
these tac@@ tics worked .
deprived of funds that had already been committed and expected , ha@@ iti fell into arre@@ ars on money o@@ wed for loan re@@ payment , trig@@ gering id@@ b policies that prevented the bank from rele@@ asing loans .
in subsequent years , the us employed additional dela@@ ying tac@@ tics , working with the id@@ b to move the goal posts whenever ha@@ iti appeared to be meeting their demands .
the results have been devastating .
the town of port-@@ de-@@ pa@@ ix , slo@@ t@@ ted ten years ago by the id@@ b as the first project site due to its particularly de@@ pl@@ orable water situation , has yet to see the implementation of any water projects .
a study conducted by z@@ an@@ mi las@@ ante , partners in health , the ro@@ bert f. ken@@ ne@@ dy mem@@ orial center for human rights , and new y@@ or@@ k university ’ s center for human rights and global justice found no functioning public water sources in the city .
researchers found three-@@ quarters of water sources in the city contained high levels of co@@ li@@ form bacter@@ ia , a key indicator of contamination with f@@ ec@@ al matter .
a fri@@ gh@@ tening 15 % of households reported symptoms likely related to typ@@ ho@@ id .
if the us and other member states join the id@@ b and take on the responsibility to improve conditions in the ameri@@ cas , they cannot then use their membership to undermine the basic rights of the people they claim to serve simply to advance their own political agenda .
the id@@ b and the us government must take responsibility for their actions and implement the necessary transparency mechanisms to ensure that such abuses do not rec@@ ur . con@@ gres@@ sional inquiries and annual reviews of the treas@@ ury department by the government accountability office could provide the over@@ sight necessary to prevent future political mis@@ use of the id@@ b and its funds .
the people of ha@@ iti , as well as us taxpayers , deserve a system that makes public the status of id@@ b loans and projects in ha@@ iti in order to ensure that the us and id@@ b member states uphold their commitments to development and human rights .
the my@@ th of sound fundament@@ als
new haven – the sp@@ in is all too predictable .
with the us stock market cla@@ wing its way back from the sharp correction of early f@@ ebru@@ ary , the min@@ dless man@@ tra of the great bul@@ l market has returned .
the recent correction is now being characterized as a fle@@ eting aber@@ ration – a vol@@ atility shock – in what is still deemed to be a very accommod@@ ating investment climate .
after all , the argument goes , economic fundament@@ als – not just in the united states , but worldwide – haven ’ t been this good in a long , long time .
but are the fundament@@ als really that sound ?
for a us economy that has a ra@@ z@@ or-@@ thin c@@ us@@ hion of saving , nothing could be further from the truth .
ameri@@ ca ’ s net national saving rate – the sum of saving by businesses , households , and the government sector – stood at just 2.1 % of national income in the third quarter of 2017 .
that is only one-@@ third the 6.@@ 3 % average that prev@@ ailed in the final three decades of the twen@@ tieth century .
it is important to think about saving in “ net ” terms , which exclu@@ des the de@@ preci@@ ation of ob@@ sole@@ te or wor@@ n-@@ out capacity in order to assess how much the economy is putting aside to fund the expansion of productive capacity .
net saving represents today ’ s investment in the future , and the bottom line for ameri@@ ca is that it is saving next to nothing .
al@@ as , the story doesn ’ t end there .
to finance consumption and growth , the us borro@@ ws surplus saving from abroad to compensate for the domestic short@@ fall .
all that borro@@ wing implies a large bal@@ ance-@@ of-@@ payments deficit with the rest of the world , which spa@@ wns an equally large trade deficit .
while president don@@ ald tru@@ mp ’ s administration is hardly responsible for this sad state of affairs , its policies are about to make a tough situation far worse .
under the gu@@ ise of tax reform , late last year tru@@ mp signed legislation that will increase the federal budget deficit by $ 1.5 tril@@ lion over the next decade .
and now the us congress , in its in@@ fin@@ ite wisdom , has u@@ pped the ante by another $ 300 billion in the latest deal to aver@@ t a government sh@@ ut@@ down .
never mind that deficit spending makes no sense when the economy is ne@@ aring full employment : this sharp wi@@ dening of the federal deficit is enough , by itself , to push the al@@ read@@ y-@@ low net national saving rate toward zero .
the personal saving rate fell to 2.4 % of dis@@ pos@@ able ( after@@ -@@ tax ) income in dec@@ ember 2017 , the lowest in 12 years and only about a quarter of the 9.@@ 3 % average that prev@@ ailed over the final three decades of the twen@@ tieth century .
as domestic saving pl@@ ung@@ es , the us has two options – a reduction in investment and the economic growth it supports , or increased borro@@ wing of surplus saving from abroad .
over the past 35 years , ameri@@ ca has consistently opted for the latter , running bal@@ ance-@@ of-@@ payments deficits every year since 1982 ( with a minor exception in 1991 , reflecting foreign contributions for us military expenses in the g@@ ulf war ) .
with these deficits , of course , come equally chronic trade deficits with a broad cross-@@ section of ameri@@ ca ’ s foreign partners .
aston@@ ish@@ ingly , in 2017 , the us ran trade deficits with 102 countries .
the multilateral foreign@@ -@@ trade deficits of a sav@@ ing-@@ short us economy set the stage for perhaps the most eg@@ regi@@ ous policy bl@@ under being committed by the tru@@ mp administration : a shift toward protectionism .
further compres@@ sion of an al@@ read@@ y-@@ weak domestic saving position sp@@ ells growing curr@@ ent-@@ account and trade deficits – a fundamental a@@ xi@@ om of macro@@ economics that the us never seems to appreciate .
attempting to solve a multilateral im@@ balance with bilateral tariffs directed mainly at ch@@ ina , such as those just imposed on solar panels and washing machines in jan@@ u@@ ary , doesn ’ t add up .
and , given the growing li@@ ke@@ lihood of additional trade barriers – as suggested by the us commerce department ’ s recent recommendations of high tariffs on al@@ umin@@ um and steel – the combination of protectionism and ever-@@ wi@@ dening trade imbalances becomes all the more problematic for a us economy set to become even more dependent on foreign capital .
far from sound , the fundament@@ als of a sav@@ ing-@@ short us economy look sha@@ k@@ ier than ever .
lacking a c@@ us@@ hion of solid support from income generation , the lack of saving also leaves the us far more be@@ hol@@ den to fi@@ ck@@ le asset markets than might otherwise be the case .
that ’ s especially true of ameri@@ can consumers who have re@@ lied on appreciation of equity holdings and home values to support over-@@ extended lifest@@ y@@ les .
it is also the case for the us federal reserve , which has turned to un@@ conventional monetary policies to support the real economy via so-called wealth effects .
and , of course , foreign investors are ac@@ utely sensitive to relative returns on assets – the us ver@@ sus other markets – as well as the translation of those returns into their home currencies .
driven by the momentum of trends in employment , industrial production , consumer sen@@ timent , and corporate earnings , the case for sound fundament@@ als plays like a broken record during periods of financial market vol@@ atility .
but momentum and fundament@@ als are two very different things .
momentum can be fle@@ eting , especially for a sav@@ ing-@@ short us economy that is consu@@ ming the seed cor@@ n of future prosperity .
with d@@ ys@@ functional policies pointing to a further compres@@ sion of saving in the years ahead , the my@@ th of sound us fundament@@ als has never rung more hol@@ low .
ameri@@ ca ’ s mid@@ term elections turn men@@ ac@@ ing
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – with the approach of this year ’ s mid@@ term elections in the united states , domestic terrorism is starting to domin@@ ate the political landscape .
first , barely two weeks before election day , an an@@ gr@@ y suppor@@ ter of us president don@@ ald tru@@ mp began sending 14 bom@@ bs to prominent democ@@ rats and others whom tru@@ mp has frequently attacked .
( none of the bom@@ bs explo@@ ded . )
then things became much worse , with the murder , on a sat@@ ur@@ day , of 11 je@@ ws in a pit@@ ts@@ burgh syn@@ ago@@ gue .
today , a pol@@ ari@@ zed and anxi@@ ous ameri@@ can public finds itself with a president totally un@@ suited to , and not very interested in , com@@ for@@ ting the nation , much less trying to lead it away from the h@@ ate and dead@@ ly parti@@ san@@ ship that he has st@@ oked .
had the 14 cru@@ de bom@@ bs , which the f@@ bi called “ potentially destruc@@ tive devices , ” worked as intended , the bom@@ b@@ maker could have killed or gra@@ vely injured a who ’ s who of tru@@ mp ad@@ vers@@ aries .
though tru@@ mp had frequently sin@@ gl@@ ed out many of the bom@@ ber ’ s targets at his r@@ allies – still att@@ acking h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , his election oppon@@ ent in 2016 , for example , and then sm@@ iling as his audience chan@@ ted “ lock her up ” – tru@@ mp ’ s defen@@ ders tried to throw the spot@@ light elsewhere .
the mail bom@@ bs , they claimed , were a “ false flag ” operation by the left , with some of the democ@@ rats even sending the bom@@ bs to themselves in order to blame tru@@ mp .
so it was highly in@@ convenient for true belie@@ vers when the w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be bom@@ ber turned out to be a fan@@ ati@@ cal tru@@ mp suppor@@ ter who lives in fl@@ ori@@ da and drives a white van covered in h@@ ate-@@ filled depic@@ tions of his targets .
us law enforcement agencies – another frequent target of tru@@ mp – are extremely good at tracking down mis@@ cre@@ ants : the suspect was arrested four days after the first bom@@ b was discovered in sor@@ os ’ s mail@@ box .
the most dis@@ hear@@ tening aspect of the entire episode was tru@@ mp ’ s utter inc@@ ap@@ acity as a national leader .
but that should surprise no one .
how could a president who has thri@@ ved politically on divi@@ ding the ameri@@ can people , who has been spe@@ wing h@@ ate , so@@ wing res@@ ent@@ ment , and at times even encouraging violence at his r@@ allies , suddenly be – or even pre@@ tend to be – a he@@ aler ?
in fact , tru@@ mp ’ s pattern of inc@@ itement and routine den@@ un@@ ci@@ ations of the media as “ the enemy of the people ” had convinced many that some of his fol@@ lo@@ wers might resort to violence against members of the press .
the day after the discovery of the bom@@ bs sent to the clin@@ tons and the ob@@ am@@ as , among others , a sub@@ du@@ ed tru@@ mp read a prepared statement at a pre@@ scheduled white house ceremony , condem@@ ning “ acts or threats of political violence ” and saying that the nation must uni@@ fy .
it didn ’ t last .
by that evening , at a r@@ ally in wis@@ cons@@ in , he was making fun of his “ trying to be nice ” act and bl@@ amed the media for the violence .
and soon he was back to wh@@ i@@ pping up fear of a car@@ av@@ an of refugees from hon@@ dur@@ as .
though still roughly 1,000 miles from the us border , tru@@ mp portra@@ yed the refugees as an im@@ min@@ ent national security threat , warning , without evidence , that “ middle e@@ ast@@ ern@@ ers ” were among them .
tru@@ mp ’ s r@@ allies are now almost a daily event , and his lies are even more frequent than before .
with the entire house of representatives and one-@@ third of the sen@@ ate to be chosen on nov@@ ember 6 , the upcoming mid@@ term election is widely regarded as the most consequ@@ ential in memory , perhaps ever .
the re@@ public@@ ans ’ two-@@ year lock on the entire us government – the house , the sen@@ ate , the presidency , and , with the recent addition of justice bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh , the su@@ preme court – could be broken .
the mid@@ term election following the election of a new president is often considered a ver@@ dict on the inc@@ umb@@ ent , and his party usually loses strength , particularly in the house .
but tru@@ mp has made the mid@@ terms about himself to an unprecedented degree .
he tells audi@@ ences that though he ’ s not on the bal@@ lot , they should vote as if he were ( though his approval rat@@ ings are in the low for@@ ties ) .
it has long been believed that the democ@@ rats are more likely to win the house than the sen@@ ate , because several of the sen@@ ate seats in play are held by democ@@ rats in traditionally conservative states .
tru@@ mp ’ s determination , or anxi@@ ety , that re@@ public@@ ans maintain control of both cham@@ bers is understandable .
should the democ@@ rats take over the house , newly em@@ powered committee chair@@ men , armed with sub@@ po@@ en@@ as , will launch investigations of a broad range of administration actions and agencies , where extensive corruption is suspected .
but the real , almost pal@@ p@@ able , fear on tru@@ mp ’ s part is that a democrati@@ c-@@ controlled house will focus all manner of investigations on him personally : his acceptance of constitu@@ tionally forbidden “ em@@ ol@@ u@@ ments ” from foreign countries ; his failure to separate himself sufficiently from the family business ; his tax returns ; his un@@ authorized foreign wars in y@@ emen and sy@@ ria ; and of course his official and private deal@@ ings with rus@@ sia .
at least the house is likely to have the conclusions of special coun@@ sel ro@@ bert mu@@ eller to consider .
in other words , no more lap@@ dog congress .
but if the re@@ public@@ ans maintain control of the sen@@ ate , there will be limits on what the democ@@ rats can achieve .
even if the house were to impe@@ ach tru@@ mp – no sure thing – convic@@ ting him in the sen@@ ate would be extremely difficult .
whether a democratic house would even proceed in that direction has been the subject of in@@ tra-@@ party debate .
the night@@ mare election possibility for the democ@@ rats is continued re@@ publi@@ can control of both cham@@ bers .
in that case , tru@@ mp will feel v@@ indicated and more liber@@ ated than ever .
he might then fire a raft of officials , treat immigrants still more har@@ sh@@ ly , and try to shut down mu@@ eller ’ s investigation of his campaign ’ s possible col@@ lu@@ sion with the kre@@ m@@ lin and tru@@ mp ’ s prob@@ able ob@@ struction of justice .
the conventional wisdom may prevail , with the democ@@ rats winning the house but not the sen@@ ate .
but the p@@ olls have been fluctu@@ ating .
and since tru@@ mp ’ s stunning election victory in 2016 , most observers have become more cau@@ tious about predic@@ ting outcomes .
al@@ liances for peace
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – i grew up in the shadow of world war ii , and at the da@@ wn of the cold war .
my father ’ s work as a foreign service officer gave me an opportunity to see history up close in a sear@@ ing way : i will never forget walking the beaches of nor@@ mand@@ y with him and seeing the bur@@ ned h@@ ul@@ ks of hig@@ gins ’ boats still on those shores , just a few years after so many young men went to their gra@@ ves so the world could be free .
what strikes me now , all these years later , is that a generation of leaders won not only a war , but also the peace .
they did it together .
the united states and our partners worked to create al@@ liances that brought prosperity and stability to western europ@@ e , jap@@ an , and south korea .
old enemies became new allies , and together pione@@ ered a new global economic system that made the world more prosperous .
and even as the cold war ra@@ ged , leaders found ways to cooperate on arms control and prevent a nuclear arma@@ ge@@ d@@ don .
in short , by building effective and indispensable international institutions and strategic partnerships , we did not just avoid another catastro@@ p@@ hic world war ; we ultimately ended the cold war and li@@ fted global living standards for hundreds of millions of people .
that is the remarkable story of the twen@@ tieth century .
the question now is what story will emerge from the twenty-@@ first century .
today , the world order faces new challenges .
rus@@ sian aggres@@ sion is r@@ att@@ ling allies .
extremis@@ ts who hi@@ jack religion threaten governments and people everywhere .
technology is acceler@@ ating a shift in the balance of power between governments and governed that offers both opportunities for democratic accountability and obstacles to inclusive politics .
stat@@ ec@@ raft has yet to adapt .
the international institutions and partnerships that emerged in the post@@ war years demand both maintenance and moderni@@ zation .
in the face of all of this tur@@ bul@@ ence , some suggest that ameri@@ ca should turn in@@ ward .
that is nothing new .
they argued it again 25 years ago , after the fall of the ber@@ lin wall .
they were wrong then – and they are wrong now .
the need for leadership has never been greater , and the us has never been more engaged with the world .
our role in afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s first-@@ ever peaceful , democratic transition remin@@ ds us all that , having invested so much blood and treas@@ ure in helping to give afgh@@ ans a chance to succeed in battle , the world has just as much responsibility to help its leaders succeed in governance .
we know that the destruction of 100 % of sy@@ ria ’ s declared chemical weapons would not have happened without direct , hand@@ s-@@ on diplomacy and per@@ sever@@ ance , just as sy@@ ria ’ s im@@ moral and hor@@ ri@@ fying civil war will not end without an equal commitment .
so , too , in a@@ sia , where president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama and chin@@ ese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping just announced ambitious commitments to tackle climate change , we are reminded of what countries can accompl@@ ish together with real leadership – and of how much additional leadership is required to conclude a successful climate agreement in par@@ is next year .
the world has changed , and we are changing with it .
lines on the map no longer contain the grav@@ est threats , and the players are no longer divided ne@@ at@@ ly into two camps .
in the twenty-@@ first century , next door is everywhere .
that is why the world needs coalition diplomacy .
no country can defeat terrorism on its own .
no country can solve the exist@@ ential threat of climate change alone .
no country can eradic@@ ate extreme poverty , combat potential pan@@ dem@@ ics , or improve nuclear security by itself .
none of us can live safer , ri@@ cher lives by turning our back to the world .
we must build on our history of working with allies by forming new co@@ ali@@ tions – with governments , with civil society , and , yes , with everyday people .
a good example is the international effort to confront the islam@@ ic state ’ s mal@@ ign brut@@ ality in i@@ ra@@ q and sy@@ ria .
political , humanitarian , and intelligence tools from more than 60 countries are being used to support unified military action .
success depends not on what one or even a hand@@ ful of countries can do alone , but on what all of us are able to achieve by moving forward together against this common threat .
on an equally important front , the us is working with the united nations to gal@@ v@@ ani@@ ze a global response to the danger posed by the eb@@ ola virus .
i have personally talked with more than 50 foreign leaders , and we all agree that only by coordinating our actions can we stop the dev@@ ast@@ ation in west afri@@ ca and halt eb@@ ola ’ s spread .
we are making progress on both issues , but much work remains .
bringing together countries with competing interests and varying resources is hard work .
it demands intense diplomatic engagement and calls upon relationships that have been built and maintained over decades , as well as al@@ liances with new partners .
but by over@@ coming differences and coordinating efforts to defeat the islam@@ ic state and con@@ quer eb@@ ola , we are reinforcing support for a world order gro@@ unded in collective solutions to common problems .
cooperation is equally vital in reinforcing the bed@@ rock economic principles on which ameri@@ ca and other countries built their post@@ war prosperity .
frustr@@ ation cannot grow faster than opportunity in any country .
for example , the negotiations on the trans@@ -@@ p@@ aci@@ fic partnership ( t@@ pp ) reflect president ob@@ ama ’ s determination to strike an acc@@ ord with countries that represent one-@@ third of global trade and 40 % of global g@@ d@@ p .
the benefits – for both the us and our partners – are enormous .
estimates are that the t@@ pp could provide $ 77 billion a year in real income and support 6@@ 50@@ ,000 new jobs in the us alone . the transatlantic trade and investment partnership being negotiated with the europ@@ ean union offers another major step toward increasing trade .
whether for mutual security or shared prosperity , genuine partnerships are not built overnight .
patient diplomacy and a collective will are needed to advance common goals .
ameri@@ ca ’ s objectives remain the same as they have been for decades – peace , prosperity , and stability for the us and for our partners around the world .
inequality and the ameri@@ can child
new y@@ or@@ k – children , it has long been recognized , are a special group .
they do not choose their parents , let alone the broader conditions into which they are born .
they do not have the same abilities as adults to protect or care for themselves .
that is why the le@@ ague of nations approved the gen@@ eva declaration on the rights of the child in 19@@ 24 , and why the international community adopted the convention on the rights of the child in 1989 .
sad@@ ly , the united states is not living up to its obligations .
in fact , it has not even ratified the convention on the rights of the child .
the us , with its cher@@ ished image as a land of opportunity , should be an inspir@@ ing example of just and en@@ ligh@@ tened treatment of children .
instead , it is a be@@ ac@@ on of failure – one that contributes to global s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish@@ ness on children ’ s rights in the international arena .
though an average ameri@@ can childhood may not be the worst in the world , the dispar@@ ity between the country ’ s wealth and the condition of its children is un@@ parall@@ eled .
about 14.@@ 5 % of the ameri@@ can population as a whole is poor , but 19.@@ 9 % of children – some 15 million individuals – live in poverty .
among developed countries , only roman@@ ia has a higher rate of child poverty .
the us rate is two-@@ thirds higher than that in the united king@@ dom , and up to four times the rate in the nor@@ dic countries .
for some groups , the situation is much worse : more than 38 % of black children , and 30 % of h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic children , are poor .
none of this is because ameri@@ cans do not care about their children .
it is because ameri@@ ca has embra@@ ced a policy agenda in recent decades that has caused its economy to become wil@@ dly un@@ equal , leaving the most vulnerable segments of society further and further behind .
the growing concentration of wealth – and a significant reduction in taxes on it – has meant less money to spend on investments for the public good , like education and the protection of children .
as a result , ameri@@ ca ’ s children have become worse off .
their fate is a painful example of how inequality not only under@@ mines economic growth and stability – as economists and organizations like the international monetary fund are finally acknowled@@ ging – but also viol@@ ates our most cher@@ ished no@@ tions of what a fair society should look like .
income inequality is cor@@ related with inequalities in health , access to education , and exposure to environmental haz@@ ards , all of which burden children more than other segments of the population .
indeed , nearly one in five poor ameri@@ can children are diagno@@ sed with as@@ th@@ ma , a rate 60 % higher than non-@@ poor children .
learning disabilities occur almost twice as frequently among children in households ear@@ ning less than $ 35@@ ,000 a year than they do in households ear@@ ning more than $ 100@@ ,000 .
and some in the us congress want to cut food st@@ amps – on which some 23 million ameri@@ can households depend , threatening the poorest children with hunger .
these inequalities in outcomes are closely tied to inequalities in opportunities .
inevitably , in countries where children have inadequate nutrition , insufficient access to health care and education , and higher exposure to environmental haz@@ ards , the children of the poor will have far different life prospects from those of the rich .
and , partly because an ameri@@ can child ’ s lifetime prospects are more dependent on his or her parents ’ income and education than in other advanced countries , the us now has the least equality of opportunity of any advanced country .
at ameri@@ ca ’ s most elite universities , for example , only around 9 % of students come from the bottom half of the population , while 74 % come from the top quarter .
most societies recognize a moral obligation to help ensure that young people can live up to their potential .
some countries even impose a constitutional mandate for equality of educational opportunities .
but in ameri@@ ca , more is spent on the education of rich students than on the education of the poor .
as a result , the us is wa@@ sting some of its most valuable assets , with some young people – bere@@ ft of skills – turning to d@@ ys@@ functional activities .
ameri@@ can states like c@@ alifor@@ nia spend about as much on pris@@ ons as on higher education – and sometimes more .
without compens@@ atory measures – including pre-@@ school education , ideally beginning at a very young age – un@@ equal opportunities translate into un@@ equal lifelong outcomes by the time children reach the age of five .
that should be a sp@@ ur to policy action .
indeed , while inequality ’ s harmful effects are wide-@@ reaching , and impose huge costs on our economies and societies , they are largely avoid@@ able .
the extre@@ mes of inequality observed in some countries are not the in@@ ex@@ orable result of economic forces and laws .
the right policies – stronger social safety nets , progressive taxation , and better regulation ( especially of the financial sector ) , to name a few – can reverse these devastating trends .
to generate the political will that such reforms require , we must confront policymakers ’ iner@@ tia and in@@ action with the gri@@ m facts of inequality and its devastating effects on our children .
we can reduce childhood de@@ priv@@ ation and increase equality of opportunity , thereby laying the ground@@ work for a more just and prosperous future – one that reflects our own avo@@ wed values .
so why don ’ t we ?
of the harm that inequality inf@@ lic@@ ts on our economies , politics , and societies , the damage done to children demands special concern .
whatever responsibility poor adults may bear for their lot in life – they may not have worked hard enough , saved enough , or made good decisions – children ’ s circumstances are thr@@ ust upon them without any sort of choice .
children , perhaps more than anyone , need the protection that rights afford – and the us should be providing the world with a sh@@ ining example of what that means .
ameri@@ can con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m ’ s crisis of ideas
ber@@ kel@@ ey – on the back left corner of my desk right now are three recent books : ar@@ thur bro@@ o@@ ks ’ the battle , char@@ les mur@@ ray ’ s coming apart , and ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ as e@@ ber@@ stadt ’ s a nation of tak@@ ers .
together , they constitute an important intellectual movement , which also happens to be a large part of the reason that ameri@@ can con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m today has little that is constructive to say about managing the economy – and little purchase on the center of the ameri@@ can elec@@ torate .
but let ’ s back up histor@@ ically , to the founding of what we might call modern con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m in early nine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century b@@ rit@@ ain and fran@@ ce .
there were some – fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ric bas@@ ti@@ at and je@@ an-@@ b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ste say come to mind – who believed that government should put the unemployed to work building infrastructure when markets or production were temporarily dis@@ rupted .
but they were balanced by those like nas@@ sau senior , who spoke out against even fam@@ ine relief : although a million people would die in the ir@@ ish pot@@ ato fam@@ ine , “ that would scar@@ c@@ ely be enough . ”
the main thr@@ ust of early con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m was roo@@ t-@@ and-@@ branch opposition to every form of social insurance : make the poor ri@@ cher , and they would become more fer@@ tile .
as a result , farm sizes would drop ( as land was divided among ever more children ) , labor productivity would fall , and the poor would become even poorer .
social insurance was not just poin@@ tless ; it was counter@@ productive .
the proper economic policy was to teach people to ven@@ er@@ ate the thr@@ one ( so that they would respect property ) , the pat@@ ern@@ al hear@@ th ( so that they would not mar@@ ry imp@@ ru@@ dently young ) , and the religious altar ( so that they would fear pre-@@ mar@@ ital sex ) .
then , perhaps , with women cha@@ ste for half or more of their child@@ bearing years , the surplus population would dimin@@ ish and conditions for the poor would be as good as they could be .
fast-@@ forward 150 years to post-@@ world war ii ameri@@ ca , and to the original ch@@ ic@@ ago school critique of the new deal version of social insurance – that it created “ not@@ ches ” that per@@ ver@@ ted economic incentives .
the government , mil@@ ton fried@@ man and others argued , told the poor : make more money and we will take away your free housing , food st@@ amps , and income support .
people are rational , fried@@ man said , so they will not work for long if they get nothing or next to nothing for it .
the big difference between the mal@@ thu@@ sian conservative critics of social insurance in the early nine@@ teenth century and the ch@@ ic@@ ago critics of the 1970 ’ s is that the ch@@ ic@@ ago critics had a point : providing public support to the “ worthy ” poor , and then removing it when they began to stand on their own feet , po@@ is@@ oned incentives and was unlikely to lead to good outcomes .
and so , from 1970 to 2000 , a broad coalition of con@@ servatives ( who wanted to see the government stop encouraging im@@ mor@@ ality ) , centr@@ ists ( who wanted government money spent effectively ) , and le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts ( who wanted poverty allevi@@ ated ) removed the “ not@@ ches ” from the soci@@ al-@@ insurance system .
presiden@@ ts j@@ im@@ my car@@ ter , ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an , ge@@ or@@ ge h. w. b@@ ush , bill clin@@ ton , and even ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush and their supporters created the current system , in which tax rates and eli@@ gi@@ bility thresh@@ olds are not p@@ uni@@ tive dis@@ incentives to enterprise .
so what is the problem that ameri@@ ca ’ s new generation of conservative critics of social insurance sees ?
it is not that raising poor people ’ s standard of living above bare sub@@ sist@@ ence produces mal@@ thu@@ sian catastro@@ phe , or that taxes and withdrawal of welfare benefits make people work , at the margin , for nothing .
for e@@ ber@@ stadt , the problem is that dependence on government is em@@ as@@ cul@@ ating , and that too many people are dependent on government .
for bro@@ o@@ ks , it is that knowing that public programs make one ’ s life easier causes one to vote for non-@@ re@@ publi@@ can candidates .
for mur@@ ray , it is that social insurance means that be@@ having badly does not lead to catastro@@ phe – and we need bad behavior to lead to catastro@@ phe in order to keep people from be@@ having badly .
the crucial point is that ameri@@ ca ’ s conservative el@@ ites believe bro@@ o@@ ks , e@@ ber@@ stadt , and mur@@ ray .
to this day , mit@@ t rom@@ ney is convinced that he lost the presidency in 2012 because bar@@ ack ob@@ ama un@@ fairly gave lat@@ in@@ o-@@ ameri@@ cans subsidi@@ zed health insurance ; gave women free re@@ productive health coverage ( excluding abor@@ tion ) ; and gave other groups similar “ gi@@ fts . ”
he could “ never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives . ”
in fact , it would be a tough sell for any candidate to convince ameri@@ cans who receive government benefits that they are dependent rather than em@@ powered ; that it is bad for people to vote for politicians who make their lives better ; and that good public policy seeks to create human catastro@@ phe rather than to aver@@ t it .
the problem for ameri@@ can con@@ servatives is not their choice of candidates or the tone of their rhetoric .
it is that their ideas are not politically sustainable .
ameri@@ can c@@ ron@@ y capit@@ alists go to war
when financial crisis hit a@@ sia in 1997 , ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s leaders charged asi@@ an governments with practic@@ ing c@@ ron@@ y capitalism .
in retro@@ spec@@ t , the charge seems like rank hypo@@ cris@@ y .
ameri@@ ca has shown itself to be second to none in practic@@ ing c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism , first with its ro@@ tten corporate sc@@ and@@ als of recent years , and now in i@@ ra@@ q .
asi@@ an capit@@ alists may have st@@ olen some borro@@ wed loo@@ t , but at least they didn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t mix finance with war .
whatever other goals lay behind the i@@ ra@@ q war , the b@@ ush administration seems keen to line the po@@ ckets of its c@@ ron@@ ies and to capture increased control over middle east oil and pipeline routes .
only a few p@@ es@@ ky obstac@@ les@@ --@@ the un , and the i@@ ra@@ q@@ i peop@@ le@@ --@@ stand in their way .
the i@@ ra@@ q war was o@@ sten@@ sibly launched because of sad@@ dam &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s weapons of mass destruction , yet each passing day suggests that the threat was exag@@ ger@@ ated .
another goal also lo@@ om@@ ed large : control over 11 % ( or more ) of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s oil reserves and , in the longer term , control over pipeline routes between the medi@@ terranean , the cas@@ pi@@ an sea , and the indi@@ an ocean .
the failure to locate sad@@ dam &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s w@@ m@@ d &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s is putting ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s gra@@ b for i@@ ra@@ q@@ i oil into sharp focus .
the chen@@ e@@ y-@@ ru@@ ms@@ feld team is so arro@@ gan@@ t that it acts as if it can f@@ laun@@ t the take@@ over of middle east oil while br@@ ush@@ ing aside questions .
in afgh@@ an@@ istan last year , the us installed ham@@ id kar@@ z@@ ai , a former consul@@ tant for oil giant un@@ o@@ cal , as interim leader .
it also appointed kal@@ may k@@ hal@@ il@@ z@@ ad , another former un@@ o@@ cal consul@@ tant --@@ indeed , kar@@ z@@ ai &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s bo@@ ss@@ --@@ as special us en@@ voy .
k@@ hal@@ il@@ z@@ ad and kar@@ z@@ ai spent considerable efforts in the late 1990s to get an ameri@@ can@@ -@@ built pipeline to carry gas from tur@@ kem@@ inst@@ an through afgh@@ an@@ istan to pak@@ istan and the indi@@ an ocean .
even before the bom@@ bs stopped falling on bag@@ h@@ dad , k@@ hal@@ il@@ z@@ ad &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s w@@ rit as special en@@ voy was extended to i@@ ra@@ q .
among his likely jobs in i@@ ra@@ q will be to secure a pipeline carrying i@@ ra@@ q@@ i oil from mo@@ su@@ l , i@@ ra@@ q to ha@@ i@@ fa , isra@@ el via sy@@ ria .
to stop sy@@ ria from objec@@ ting , the us is now threatening it as well .
k@@ hal@@ il@@ z@@ ad will have plenty of support in the b@@ ush administration , which is heavily loaded with oil industry exec@@ u@@ tives .
national security advis@@ or con@@ dele@@ e@@ za rice was a director of ch@@ ev@@ ron@@ -@@ tex@@ aco before coming to the national security council .
she even had an oil tan@@ ker named after her .
commerce secret@@ ary don ev@@ ans is also an o@@ il-@@ company ce@@ o .
vice president rich@@ ard chen@@ ey was in effect lead conduc@@ tor of the group when he served as chairman of hal@@ li@@ bur@@ ton , the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s largest oil services company .
hal@@ li@@ bur@@ ton is now at the front of the line for i@@ ra@@ q@@ i reconstruction projects , for which contracts are being handed out without any transparent and competitive process whatsoever .
but what is happening here is more than &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; guil@@ t by association &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; with the oil industry .
the b@@ ush administration is fl@@ ou@@ ting every rule to give its c@@ ron@@ ies the inside track .
before joining the p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on , don@@ ald ru@@ ms@@ feld was a key player as well .
a long@@ standing side@@ k@@ ick of chen@@ ey , ru@@ ms@@ feld travel@@ ed to bag@@ h@@ dad in 1983 and 1984 at the be@@ h@@ est of former be@@ ch@@ tel cor@@ poration president ge@@ or@@ ge sh@@ ul@@ tz , then passing a bit of non-@@ corporate time as us secret@@ ary of state .
ru@@ ms@@ feld &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s hidden mission was to win sad@@ dam &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s support of a be@@ cht@@ el-@@ built oil pipeline to run from i@@ ra@@ q via jord@@ an to the g@@ ulf of a@@ q@@ aba .
this is the same be@@ ch@@ tel which built sad@@ dam &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dual use &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; chemical industry ; now it has been awarded a non-@@ competitive $ 600 million me@@ ga@@ -@@ contract to re@@ build i@@ ra@@ q@@ i infrastructure .
ameri@@ can newspapers now report that former shell oil ce@@ o p@@ hili@@ p car@@ roll will be appointed as the us cz@@ ar of i@@ ra@@ q@@ i oil .
car@@ roll &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s most recent job was as chief executive of flu@@ or , the giant construction con@@ glomer@@ ate , another company that , together with be@@ ch@@ tel and hal@@ li@@ bur@@ ton , is in line for the big bu@@ cks that will soon be paid ( using i@@ ra@@ q &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s oil earnings ) for us-@@ led reconstruction .
the united king@@ dom can &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t match the us in c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism , but b@@ rit@@ ain &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s support for ameri@@ ca in the war also has a commercial logic .
while sad@@ dam gave oil contracts to f@@ ren@@ ch , rus@@ sian , and chin@@ ese oil firms , uk firms such as b@@ p were frozen out .
uk firms are no doubt counting on returning to i@@ ra@@ q on ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s co@@ atta@@ ils .
only a few hur@@ d@@ les remain before the us can consu@@ mm@@ ate its c@@ ron@@ y take@@ over of i@@ ra@@ q &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s oil .
ameri@@ ca will soon try to appoint an i@@ ra@@ q@@ i regime that will aim to cancel many of sad@@ dam &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s oil contracts with fran@@ ce , rus@@ sia , and ch@@ ina , in order to make room for us and uk firms .
but this will be harder to accompl@@ ish than simply sending in the us army .
the us can not legally market i@@ ra@@ q@@ i oil , much less invest in new fields , until the old un sanctions against i@@ ra@@ q are li@@ fted .
but the rest of the world believes that lifting the sanctions is t@@ ant@@ amount to hand@@ ing i@@ ra@@ q &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s oil future over to the us and uk occup@@ ying forces and their corporate c@@ ron@@ ies .
more telling , and significant in the long term , is the remarkable anti-@@ us and anti-@@ uk sen@@ timent now swe@@ eping i@@ ra@@ q .
rather than being welcomed as liber@@ ators , the us and uk are seen as new colonial occu@@ pi@@ ers , and the i@@ ra@@ q@@ is are mobi@@ liz@@ ing to push the occu@@ pi@@ ers out .
the us may have done something few could have expected : united the sh@@ i &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ ites and the sun@@ nis in a common cause .
democracy may come to i@@ ra@@ q , and the will of the people will be to stop the pl@@ under of their country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s natural resources by us c@@ ron@@ y capit@@ alists .
an un@@ h@@ ing@@ ed democracy in ameri@@ ca
new y@@ or@@ k – al@@ ex@@ is de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille , a liberal f@@ ren@@ ch ar@@ isto@@ c@@ rat , visited the united states in 18@@ 31 o@@ sten@@ sibly to write a study of its “ en@@ ligh@@ tened ” prison system ( lo@@ cking people up in sol@@ it@@ ary con@@ fin@@ ement like pen@@ it@@ ent mon@@ ks was the latest modern idea ) .
out of this trip came de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille ’ s master@@ piece , democracy in ameri@@ ca , in which he expressed ad@@ mir@@ ation for ameri@@ can civil liber@@ ties and compared the world ’ s first genuine liberal democracy favor@@ ably with old world institutions .
but de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille had serious reservations , too .
the biggest danger to us democracy , he believed , was the ty@@ ran@@ ny of the majority , the suff@@ oc@@ ating intellectual conformity of ameri@@ can life , the sti@@ fl@@ ing of minority opinion and dis@@ sent .
he was convinced that any exercise of unlimited power , be it by an individual des@@ pot or a political majority , is bound to end in disaster .
democracy , in the sense of majority rule , needs restra@@ ints , just like any other system of government .
that is why the bri@@ tish have mixed the authority of elected politicians with that of ar@@ isto@@ c@@ ratic privi@@ lege .
and it is why ameri@@ cans still cher@@ ish their constitution ’ s separation of governmental powers .
by contrast , in the f@@ ren@@ ch re@@ publi@@ can system , the state represents the so-called will of the people .
as a result , its authority is less constra@@ ined , which may explain the greater frequency in fran@@ ce of street demonstrations and even of mo@@ b violence .
indeed , these up@@ heav@@ als may act as informal checks on official power .
de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille identified another source of restra@@ int in the us system : the power of religion .
human gre@@ ed , as well as the temp@@ tation of going to extre@@ mes , was tem@@ pered by the moder@@ ating influence of a shared ch@@ ris@@ tian faith .
liberty , in the us , was in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably ent@@ win@@ ed with religious belief .
the spectac@@ le of ameri@@ can politics today would seem to cast doubt on de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille ’ s observation .
or , rather , the rhetoric of many re@@ public@@ ans asp@@ iring to be president sounds like a per@@ version of what he saw in 18@@ 31 .
religion and liberty are still mentioned in one bre@@ ath , but often to promote extreme views .
religious minorities are den@@ ounced .
a@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic fears are st@@ oked .
in@@ tolerance is promoted .
all in the name of go@@ d .
of course , the us is not the only country where fr@@ inge de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues are now po@@ is@@ oning main@@ stream politics .
religious language is less often heard in western europ@@ e , but all the more in parts of eastern europ@@ e , tur@@ key , and isra@@ el .
and the message of popul@@ ism is similar everywhere in the democratic world : liberal el@@ ites are to be bl@@ amed for all our ills and an@@ x@@ ieties , from europ@@ e ’ s refugee crisis to the in@@ equi@@ ties of the global economy , from “ multi@@ cultur@@ alism ” to the rise of radical is@@ lam .
popul@@ ism is causing considerable alarm , not least because main@@ stream politicians seem less and less capable of finding a convincing way to stop its rise .
those who are rightly worried about the politics of fear like to assume that popul@@ ism is a threat to democracy itself .
dist@@ r@@ ust of the el@@ ites fo@@ sters dist@@ r@@ ust of the system , and the long@@ ing for great leaders who will deliver us from the sel@@ f@@ ish@@ ness of professional politicians will lead to new forms of ty@@ ran@@ ny .
that may turn out to be true .
but , in fact , it is not really democracy that is pres@@ ently under sie@@ ge .
in some ways , many societies are more democratic than they were before .
if nothing else , the don@@ ald tru@@ mp phenomenon shows that old party establishments can be sk@@ ir@@ ted by popular out@@ si@@ ders .
social media also make it possible to b@@ yp@@ ass the traditional filters of authority , such as serious newspapers or broadcast@@ ers , and publish any point of view directly .
the power of private fortun@@ es to s@@ way public opinion , especially in the us , also up@@ sets the traditional order .
anti-@@ e@@ liti@@ s@@ m can be f@@ ann@@ ed by vast individual wealth , because e@@ liti@@ s@@ m is defined less by financial cl@@ out than by education .
an@@ gr@@ y people s@@ wa@@ yed by the popul@@ ist message are an@@ gri@@ er at liberal prof@@ essors , cle@@ ver ban@@ kers , or skep@@ tical journalists than they are at multi-@@ billi@@ on@@ ai@@ res .
( it is both president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s elite education and the color of his skin – or , rather , the combination of the two – that has attracted so much rage . )
at the same time , people have more power to elect power@@ -@@ hung@@ ry cro@@ o@@ ks than they did before .
like the wild and wo@@ ol@@ ly views s@@ wir@@ ling around the internet , such figures are no longer kept at bay by traditional party el@@ ites .
what is steadily falling away is not democracy , but the restra@@ ints that de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille thought were essential to make liberal politics work .
more and more , popul@@ ist leaders regard their election by the majority of voters as a license to cr@@ ush all political and cultural dis@@ sent .
de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille ’ s night@@ mare is not yet the reality in the us , but it is close to what we see in rus@@ sia , tur@@ key , hung@@ ary , and perhaps pol@@ and .
even isra@@ el , which , despite its many obvious problems , has always had a robust democracy , is moving in this direction , with government ministers demanding proof of “ state loy@@ alty ” from writers , artists , and journalists .
it is hard to see how traditional el@@ ites are going to reg@@ ain any authority .
and yet i think de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille was right .
without editors , there can be no serious journ@@ alism .
without parties led by experienced politicians , the borders between show business and politics will disappear .
without limits placed on the appe@@ ti@@ tes and prejudi@@ ces of the majority , in@@ tolerance will rule .
this is not a question of no@@ stal@@ gia or s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
nor is it a ple@@ a to trust anyone with a plau@@ sible air of authority .
anger at the el@@ ites is not always un@@ just .
globalization , immigration , and cosm@@ opol@@ it@@ anism have served the interests of a highly educated minority , but sometimes at the expense of less privileged people .
and yet , the problem identified by de to@@ c@@ qu@@ ev@@ ille in the 18@@ 30@@ s is more relevant now than ever .
liberal democracy cannot be reduced to a popularity contest .
constraints on majority rule are necessary to protect the rights of minorities , be they ethnic , religious , or intellectual .
when that protection dis@@ appears , we will all end up losing the freedoms that democracy was supposed to defend .
the indispensable ameri@@ can partner
ma@@ dri@@ d – the united states is ge@@ aring up for that most in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating ( and exhau@@ sting ) of political events : an open-@@ seat race for the presidency .
as a result , the election could be less a referendum on the last eight years than a contest of ideas , with foreign policy emerging as a key topic .
the potential candidates have already sought to stake out their positions on key foreign@@ -@@ policy issues , with early re@@ publi@@ can fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner je@@ b b@@ ush , for example , delivering a speech devoted entirely to the topic .
as for the democ@@ rats , former secret@@ ary of state h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s likely nom@@ ination ( despite recent re@@ vel@@ ations that she used her personal email account to conduct government business ) rein@@ forces foreign policy &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s centr@@ ality to the election .
recogni@@ zing this trend , the world economic forum global agenda council has brought together a group of experts and practi@@ tioners to help inf@@ use substance into the foreign@@ -@@ policy discussions leading up to the us election , including by preparing a public discussion paper .
from my perspective as the group &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s only europ@@ ean member , the over@@ ar@@ ching message should be that the us must conc@@ eive of itself not as “ the indispensable power , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; as it now does , but as “ the indispensable partner . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
this is not merely a matter of sem@@ an@@ tics ; such a change will require the us to re-@@ conc@@ eive its role in the world .
but the pa@@ yo@@ ff , for both the us and the liberal world order that it created , would be substantial .
the key to success will be ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ability to retain the best – and abandon the worst – of that most ameri@@ can of no@@ tions : excep@@ tion@@ alism .
the sense in the us that the country is unique , with a special mission to promote prosperity , security , and freedom worldwide , has long shaped ameri@@ can foreign policy .
the idea extends as far back as 16@@ 30 , when j@@ oh@@ n win@@ thro@@ p , the mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts bay col@@ ony &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s first govern@@ or , declared that his community must act as a “ city upon a hill , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; setting an example for the world .
in doing so , he plan@@ ted the seed of the valu@@ es-@@ based approach that was adopted by the us as it sp@@ ear@@ headed the development of the rules and structures that order today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s world .
those rules and structures have delivered unprecedented economic growth , benefiting all ( though the us has re@@ ap@@ ed the greatest re@@ wards ) .
but , ir@@ on@@ ically , the notion of ameri@@ can excep@@ tion@@ alism often has led the us to undermine the international system that it nur@@ tured .
indeed , us history reveals a persistent isol@@ ation@@ ist stre@@ ak , in which the “ city upon a hill &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is not a be@@ ac@@ on , but a fortress .
at times , including over the last six years , the belief that the us is better off going it alone has led to withdrawal from the world .
this tendency was not a serious issue before world war ii ( though the people of ab@@ ys@@ sin@@ ia and man@@ chur@@ ia may be@@ g to differ ) .
but today , us withdrawal from the international system that it built has serious rami@@ fications – namely , the kind of cha@@ os and law@@ less@@ ness exemp@@ li@@ fied by rus@@ sia &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s invasion of ukra@@ ine .
yet isol@@ ation@@ ism is not ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s most destruc@@ tive impul@@ se .
worse is its “ exemp@@ tion@@ alism &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; : its pen@@ ch@@ ant for op@@ ting out of the rules that it promotes – and often actively en@@ forces – elsewhere .
the lengthy – and growing – list of major international conventions left un@@ ratified by the us includes the ro@@ me statute of the international criminal court , the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women , the mine ban convention , the convention on the rights of the child , and the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities .
beyond the res@@ ent@@ ment that such an attitude en@@ gen@@ ders , ameri@@ can exemp@@ tion@@ alism directly under@@ mines multilateral institutions &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; capacity to address challenges that the us is un@@ willing or unable to resolve on its own .
how can the us expect ch@@ ina to follow rules on maritime deli@@ mit@@ ation in the east and south ch@@ ina seas when it ref@@ uses to ratify the united nations convention on the law of the sea ?
us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s administration has tried to create the illu@@ sion of a change of course in this regard , pushing “ soft &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; deals that allow the us to participate without submitting to binding rules .
such was the case with the mu@@ ch-@@ lau@@ ded “ hand@@ sha@@ ke agreement &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; between ob@@ ama and chin@@ ese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping on car@@ b@@ on-@@ dioxide emissions in nov@@ ember .
but , though such arrangements make for great head@@ lines , they do not provide the stability and pre@@ dict@@ ability necessary for long-term success .
for that , hard rules and strong institutions are essential .
if the us is to serve as the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s “ indispensable partner , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it must rec@@ omm@@ it to the rul@@ es-@@ based order that has served it – and the world – so well for the last seven decades .
it should begin by strengthening the flag@@ ging institutions that have served as the back@@ bone of the liberal international order .
specifically , the us should finally approve the international monetary fund reform package that was agreed in 2010 ; promote real progress at the non-@@ proliferation treaty review conference in may ; and ensure that this dec@@ ember &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s un framework convention on climate change conference in par@@ is yiel@@ ds formal commitments .
it requires vision , commitment , and , most important , leadership .
a fran@@ k discussion about ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s foreign policy could prove vital to ensuring that this “ city upon a hill &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; remains a be@@ ac@@ on of hope – and a cataly@@ st of progress .
ameri@@ can foreign policy after i@@ ra@@ q
what comes after i@@ ra@@ q ?
if president ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush ’ s current tro@@ op “ sur@@ ge ” fails to produce an outcome that can be called “ victory , ” what lessons will the united states draw for its future foreign policy ?
will it turn in@@ ward , as it did after its defeat in vi@@ et@@ nam three decades ago ?
will it turn from promoting democracy to a narrow re@@ alist view of its interests ?
even while discussion in wash@@ ington is fix@@ ated on i@@ ra@@ q , a number of thou@@ ghtful foreign observers are asking these lon@@ ger-@@ term questions .
an@@ al@@ yst@@ s and pun@@ di@@ ts have often been mis@@ taken about ameri@@ ca ’ s position in the world .
for example , two decades ago , the conventional wisdom was that the us was in decline .
a decade later , with the cold war ’ s end , the new conventional wisdom was that the world was a uni@@ pol@@ ar ameri@@ can he@@ gem@@ ony .
some neo-@@ conservative pun@@ di@@ ts drew the conclusion that the us was so powerful that it could decide what it thought was right , and others would have to follow .
char@@ les k@@ rau@@ th@@ ammer celebrated this view as “ the new unilater@@ alism , ” and it heavily influenced the b@@ ush administration even before the attacks on se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 11 , 2001 .
but the new unilater@@ alism was based on a profound mis@@ understanding of the nature of power in world politics .
power is the ability to get the outcomes one wants .
whether the possession of resources will produce such outcomes depends upon the context .
for example , a large , modern tank army is a powerful resource if a war is fought in a desert , but not if it is fought in a sw@@ amp – as ameri@@ ca discovered in vi@@ et@@ nam .
in the past , it was assumed that military power dominated most issues , but in today ’ s world , the con@@ texts of power differ greatly .
i have lik@@ ened the distribution of power in politics today as an@@ alog@@ ous to a three-@@ dimensional ch@@ ess game .
on the top board – military relations among states – the world is , indeed , uni@@ pol@@ ar , and likely to remain that way for decades .
but on the middle board of economic relations , the world is already multi@@ pol@@ ar , and the us cannot obtain the outcomes it wants without the cooperation of europ@@ e , jap@@ an , ch@@ ina , and others .
and , on the bottom board of transnational issues outside the control of governments – including everything from climate change to pan@@ dem@@ ics to transnational terrorism – power is cha@@ o@@ tically distributed , and it makes no sense at all to claim ameri@@ can he@@ gem@@ ony .
yet it is on this bottom board that we find most of the greatest challenges we face today .
the only way to gra@@ pp@@ le with these problems is through cooperation with others , and that requires the “ soft ” power of attraction as well as the hard power of co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
there is no simple military solution that will produce the outcomes we want .
the new unilater@@ alists who dominated b@@ ush ’ s first administration made the mistake of thinking that the uni@@ pol@@ ar distribution of power in the military context was sufficient to guide foreign policy .
they were like a young boy with a ham@@ mer who thinks that every problem resem@@ bles a nail .
the danger of their approach is now obvious .
wh@@ o@@ ever plays a three-@@ dimensional game by focusing on only one board is bound to lose in the long run .
fortunately , the pen@@ dul@@ um has begun to s@@ wing back toward cooperation .
in b@@ ush ’ s second term , some of the most extreme unilater@@ alists have depar@@ ted from the government , and the president has appro@@ ached difficult problems like north korea or ir@@ an with a more multilateral approach than during his first term .
likewise , for all the complaints about the united nations , the us and others turned to un peac@@ eke@@ ep@@ ers to sort out the m@@ ess after the le@@ ban@@ on war last summer .
the i@@ ra@@ q war , in particular , increased public awareness of the mistakes in b@@ ush ’ s first term , but other issues are changing as well .
ameri@@ cans now view cooperative action on global climate change more favor@@ ably .
simil@@ arly , the threat of pan@@ dem@@ ics means that ameri@@ cans may come to recognize the importance of a stronger world health organization , just as the problem of nuclear proliferation is increasing awareness of the importance of the international atom@@ ic energy agency .
the nature of these problems means that the us does not have the luxury of turning in@@ ward no matter what the outcome in i@@ ra@@ q .
these are not problems you can leave overseas .
they follow you home .
it also is unlikely that ameri@@ can foreign policy will return to a narrow realis@@ m and drop all emphasis on democracy and human rights .
while the i@@ ra@@ q war dis@@ credi@@ ted the idea of co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve democrati@@ zation , both re@@ public@@ ans and democ@@ rats have a strong strand of ide@@ alism in their foreign policy orient@@ ations .
the problem for wh@@ o@@ ever is elected president in 2008 will be to find appropriate realistic means to advance democratic values and adjust official rhetoric accordingly .
when rhetoric greatly out@@ stri@@ ps reality , others view it as hypo@@ cris@@ y .
ameri@@ cans will need to find ways to asser@@ t their nar@@ r@@ ative of democracy , freedom , and rights in a manner that respects diversity and the views of others .
what i@@ ra@@ q has taught is the importance of developing civil society and the rule of law before trying to hold broad@@ -based elections .
democracy is more than voting , for it requires large investments in education , institutions , and promotion of non-governmental organizations .
it must be roo@@ ted in the indigenous society and bear its characteristics , not be imposed from abroad .
it is highly unlikely that the us will react after i@@ ra@@ q as it did after vi@@ et@@ nam .
the parado@@ x of ameri@@ can power is that the world ’ s only military super@@ power cannot protect its citizens by acting alone .
