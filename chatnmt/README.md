Data processing:
Since all data is already checked into git, you can skip to Training.
Most of the data has been generated by some of our own scripts.
to reproduce concat data processing scripts, run: `python extract_sentence.py`
to reproduce BPE processing for immediate training with JoeyNMT, you can run:
`python extract_data.py`, then `bash preprocess.sh` to load the config's expected data paths

Training:
Now, you should be able to run `python3 -m joeynmt train configs/transformer_wmt_chat.yaml`!
