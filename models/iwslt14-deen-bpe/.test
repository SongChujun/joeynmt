you know , one of the great tricks travel , and one of the pleasure in race is to live together with people who are comfortable with the old days , and the rest of their past is still going to touch them on the rain , taste in the wild , taste in the bitter bones of plant .
and just knowing that , yes , yes , the way beyond the milky way , or meaning the myths of the myths of the oldest of the oldest , or that in the middle of the buddhist , the idea , is the idea that the world &apos;s guild , is not in an absolute sense , but only as a result of a group of certain options that we know , the way we know is ,
and of course we all share the same adaptability .
we are we born . we bring children to the world .
we &apos;re running through convergence .
we need to know , we need to be done with the vector of separation through death and so we should not surprise us that we &apos;re all sang and dance and art .
but interesting is the unique resonance of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the swneo in the forests of borneo , or the soolyra in haiti , or the warrior in the andes of central telescopes , in the andes , in the antarctic , in the middle of the andes , and this is coincidentally by a month when i traveled to a month of the desert , or even a , rhythm , of the qo@@
all of these people teach us that there are other ways of living , other ways , different ways of guidance on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that if you think about it , only to achieve hope .
together , the tens of thousands of cultures of the world , a network of a network of spirituality and cultural new lives that correspond to earth is as important to the earth as the biological life of life that you know as biosphere .
you can think of this cultural life web as a bureaucracy , race -- the total of the sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths that have been inspired ideas , inspiration and faultions that have been generated by the first time of consciousness since the onset of consciousness has been defined .
race of the great sphere is the great legacy of humankind .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we are doing as amazing as amazing species .
and just as the biosphere was very fragmented , this happened with the ethnic nonosphere -- only with more speed .
no biologist , for example , is to say that 50 percent or more of all sorts of species of all sorts of extinction before , because it &apos;s just right . and yet , this -- the apocolist apostic bias , in the area of the biological diversity -- is not the most optimizing us as most optimization in the area of cultural diversity .
and the decisive is the dying of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages on earth 6,000 languages .
now , one language is not just the growth of the vocabulary or a series of grammatication .
one language is the expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that makes the soul of a certain culture , finds the tangible world .
every language is like a long-ager forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem spiritual .
and from those 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting in monterey , they don &apos;t even be in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught for infants anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more inclusive than the silence of being able to be one of the last of your people who are talking to your language , have no possibility to admit the wisdom of the ancestors or the hope of hope ?
and yet , this terrible fate , actually , in fact , in fact , of course , somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because all two weeks , is a older man , and takes the last grade of old language to the grave .
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all would talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language yoruba . let &apos;s be canniese .
let &apos;s be a . &quot;
and then suddenly they would suddenly realize what it would be if you might talk your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you in a trip today in a journey through the race sphere , a brief journey through the ethical sphere , to try and figure out what &apos;s actually lost .
now , there are some of us who are in a certain way , that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different options of being mine .
take for example , for example , this kid , the barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the epidemic of the anda , believe that they came from mythologically the milky way from the east , in the belly .
that &apos;s a people , which is not cognitively different between the color of blue and green , because the sun is dependent upon the forest that &apos;s dependent on .
they have a reasonable language , and a marriage sdeliberation that is called a happy term , called a linguistic to marry someone who talks a different .
all of this ties in the mythological past , the strange ones of these large houses where the misrollers are spoken by six or seven languages , but that you never want somebody who is learning a language .
they just stop and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating strains that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the orange i in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was at the first night of 1958 .
in 1957 , there tried to be five missionary contact and made a severe mistake .
and they threw photos from the air outside of the air , which we were suspicious of as a friendly gesture attack these people from the rainforest never seen from the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything , and then decide that these business maps of the devil rock were killed and killed the five missionary assignments .
but the waai didn &apos;t even killed the seed of the wood.
they made each other .
eighty percent of the deaths were happening through drilling .
we followed the geneticaology for eight generations , and two cases of the natural death and when we asked people about it , one of the people , one of the people had gotten so old , because of his age died , and we were killing him .
but at the same time , they had a very clear knowledge of the forest was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of a population of 40 steps away and determine what the animal species of this mine .
in early 16 years , i got a really amazing task when my professors asked me to go to harvard school , if i was interested in to go to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the seminal and tonton macoutes , and the poison that was used to make zombies to make sure .
so to give this very hard sense , i had to give a sense of , of course , something about this remarkable belief knowledge and voodoo and voodoo isn &apos;t a cult of black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical world view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask them to count the great world &apos;s largest world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
one continent is going to leave you , because the premise was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , and of course there was just the exaggeration of these very deep religious thought that came out of the tragic diaspora .
but what &apos;s interesting is so interesting , this live relationship between the living and the dead .
and the living people respond .
and the minds can be stated by under a large water , respond to the rhythm of dance to measure the soul of the living across the living , so that the acolyth for a brief listening moment to god .
so did like to say , call the voodoo oddist , &quot; your white is in the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be copied by the mind . how can you get damage ?
you see those amazing demonstrations : voodoo akolyths in a see-state , which is without burning of his burning coal , an amazing visualization of the spirit of the spirit of the brain to affect the body that keeps it when it &apos;s being thrown into a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all the people that i met , the kogi from the sierra nevada de of the sierra nevada de the santa marta in northern colombia , the most extraordinary .
sentenced of the old tyrannious civilization , the post-bian coastal level of colombia , and in a series of the ants resulted in a result , led to the fact in an 8-volcanic titanium to increase over the caribbean coast .
in a blood bloodline continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the spaniards .
by the course of the day , they &apos;re ruled by a ritual priesthood , but the training of the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths become separated in the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shadow of the finsaver , in stone hills at the glacier for 18 years , to choose by giving birth to the nine months of pregnancy that they spent on the lap of their leibful mother , now , they have a metamgic mom in the pursuit of great mother .
and while this whole time , it &apos;s culturally organized in the values of their society , values that keep the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , it &apos;s taken out of the outside , and for the first time in your life , at 18 years of 18 , you see a sunwhite moment of the first light , when the sun begins to the bow of amazing beautiful beautiful landscape , and the priest comes back and says , &quot; you know ? it &apos;s really what i &apos;ve told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we are responsible for the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of afghanistan and landscape , we don &apos;t think of rousseau and the old scaffolding of the nostic savstrike , which is a rassistic thought or at the other thoreau and saying , these people are connected more with nature .
so , you know , you have babies are not sentimentally , they &apos;re going to get off of the nostalgia .
it &apos;s not a lot of places in the malarial plaads from asmat , or the cold winds of tibet , but still , through time and ritual a mysterious nimbus of the earth , the idea not to be close to her , but on a far-subtle intuition , the idea that the earth is going to be in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes that grows into belief in believing that the mountain is an apo-spirit , who can determine your destiny , is going to be a very different person , and one different relationship to the montana , it &apos;s going to grow a pile of stones is a pile of stones that can be a pile of stones .
whether he &apos;s a meeting in a mind or a pile of input , is irrelevant .
what &apos;s interesting thing is the metaphor that &apos;s defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of bricbia colombia and believed that these forests were there to become depressed .
and that made me to another person as my friends under the kwakitl , who believe that these forests of hukuk and the gebian celebs are cruak , and the cannics , who live the northern sea of the world , ghosts them to participate of the west , who plays .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different different kinds of realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries here , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photo i took me last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the strongest psycho-perparat from the opposition of shame .
what drives ayahuca so fascinates is not just not only the pharmaologic potential of this preparature , but it &apos;s going to work out of two different sources , in the one hand , there &apos;s a series of people who es , harmolin , notylin , and this climber is more than if a blue lion of smoke in her memory from a tube of a coffee
this plant contains a couple of very strong tryptamine that are very similar to the existing methogenyltrorioriin a very similar way .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomomi , as you know , how you &apos;re failing this stuff , this substance that you create from different species is used to be used in many different species .
the powder of hating out is about being out of an escalator , confined from baromat &apos;s paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not be a distorted reality , but the resolution reality .
i even led to my professor , richard evan shulstin , the man who has led the kinechedelic enzyme in mexico in mexico in the 3000th of years , and i argued that you feel this tryptamine , because in the moment where you feel the effects that &apos;s not more than a hallucination .
but the thing about satellites is tamlic is that they can &apos;t be contained beautifully , because it is due to one in the human gut , of course , by the proliamsy oxidase .
they can only be locked up with some other chemicals , more chemicals that can build the oregon orization .
now , the amazing thing is that the rule of the sheds are contained in liites , mao-of-bitors of exactly the way they need to force the tryptamine , so they ask themselves .
how do can find these people from a flora of 80,000 species of adhised plants that can find these two morphologically related plants , which , if in this way , combined , to create a kind of biochemical version , so that &apos;s all bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which it turns out to be meaningful .
but you ask the indians they say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the coach , have 17 variations on yoahuasca , who recognizes them all at large distances in the forest that appear to our eyes as a species .
and then , you wonder how to make your taxonomie , and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;d think about plants .
i mean , do you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that each of the 17 varies of 17 varieties at full moon , and you sing them into a different sound .
now , this is not bringing you a ph.d. in harvard at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , this problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the ear for us who have been born to the hard position of being born , in orniiniell and colorful , but they &apos;re focused on the past , while the real world , meaning our world .
so , the fact is , you know , at the 20th century , in 300 years not remember its wars or technological innovations , but rather than a era where we were rescued , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either active or passive , so the problem is not change .
all cultures still cultures have involved in the dance with new life possibilities .
and the problem is not technology .
the abx didn &apos;t not heard any of the sioux when they were the arch and the reagan tasks when americans were listening to being americans , when they were horse and horse teachers .
not change and technology endangered and technology threaten the integrity of the race . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look around in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not going to go away from the extinction people whose existence through detecting by detecting their capacity to the rubs , a nomadantis of southeast asia , of the forest , from the south ocean , from the south of the south of the ocean , which is ready to fill of the ocean , their pel@@
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i study newwell , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phyic extinction of people becomes convicted of general , but the ethozoics , the destruction of the lives of people , is not only convicted , but in common and many ways .
and you cannot understand that hurt unless you &apos;ve experienced it on the bottom level .
i was a young colleagues with a young collaborator 63,000 miles in west china through southeast tibet , and only when i went to lhasa , i saw behind the statistics of whom you hear . 6,000 sacred monuments and ashes , 1.2 million people who were murdered by the cultural revolution .
the father of this boy was identified as a man of the aurora .
this meant that it was being killed during the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle wail , she es to the diaspora in the diaspora that brought people to nepal .
his mother was being locked in , as punishment for punishment -- for the crime for crime .
he was smuggled in the age of two years in prison to hide under their rock balls because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the nurse who was doing this tasty was brought into an educational prison .
one day she came out of a prosthetic band maos , and it had to cut them for seven years into a heavy labor .
the suffering may be inducsible , but the spirit of people is something unforgeable .
and at the end , we are really talking about a choice : do we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that died was her biggest fear , that while we could move towards a thread , we can move around the range of human imagination , we wouldn &apos;t just see the entire range of the human imagination , but that way , ever given one day from a dream , and forgotten , there were any other options .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that , perhaps our species existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of the seed underthrew poetry through the prosa of prids and hierarchy and a hierarchy , specialization -- it was just 10,000 years ago .
the modern world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have the answers to the challenges that we face in the thousands of millennia .
if we ask these tens of indigenous cultures to the importance of human history , they answer to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to discover the possibility of what we are : people with the full of consciousness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to flourish , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photo i took at the end of the baffin islands when i went to the scanans on the narm hunt , and this man , olinda , told me a wonderful story of his great-father .
the canadian government is not always good with the inuit and during the inuit years , and during the most 500,000 years of the established of our domances , they were forced to raise settlements .
the grandfather man &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family , the fear of being alive , all of course , took all the weapons and the tools .
now , you know , the inuit wisdom have no fear have to be used to their advantage .
the tracks their tracks were made out of fish , which was built in the airplane skin .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear before the arctic night or the crashstorm .
he was crying out , threw out , he made his pants out of the sea niglsdrums and desned into his hand , and when the cleaner began to freeze , he formed them into the form of a knife .
and he spraoned a spraying on the sides of the barrels of lllular tips , and when it was completely frozen , he saw a dog with it .
and he ated the dog and improvised a squirr , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvising a small dog , and put a different , with the ice chest .
you can &apos;t do something like that .
and this is a symbol of many times for the resistance of the inuit and all in the world .
the canadian government gave us , in april 1999 , in 1999 to an area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home and it &apos;s called a diplomat .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all of the lakes .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , a state that can look back to their people and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to this distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
you &apos;re the countries of somebody &apos;s neighbors .
they represent parts of the human imagination in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children will become , how the dreams of our own children are part of the conventional children &apos;s hopeful .
what we &apos;re happening at national geographic is that we think politicians never do something .
we believe that polemik -- we believe that polegls is not conclusive , but we believe that storytelling can be changing the world , and so we &apos;re probably seeing the best institution for storytelling , and our website gets 35 million every month .
156 nations send our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series into the state of race , where we take our audiences to places from such cultural wonders , and hopefully , one after the other is the central revelation of antiquia , that this world is made to exist in different ways , that we can find a life of life in a truly multical pluralistic world where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first do is that &apos;s possible to show you &apos;re going to show you , is the basic work , a new technology that have microsoft than part of one year ago , to give up a year ago , and that &apos;s a sea , and it &apos;s a environment that can be able to deal with normal amounts of visual data .
we see a lot , many , many gigabytes of digital photographs , which you can mix in and move on , you know , shack , re-arranged in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we see , how big these devices are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this is , for example , a scan of the library of congress , and it &apos;s in a field of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the power of a system can be constrained , is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment , it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-resolution data data .
this is b-house house of violent . each crevling is a chapter .
so to prove that it really matters to a text , and not about a picture , we can actually do something like that , to really show that this is real representation of the context and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is an interesting case . this is a headline in the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a date .
and this is really the pleasure and the good experience of reading a true paper worth of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also have something on the corner of this particular sequence .
we &apos;ve designed a false framework with very high resolution that is much higher than in a normal display , and we added additional content into it .
if you want to see the functions of this car you can see here .
or other models , or even technical specialized .
and this really reaches these ideas to allow these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a goopanor more nonsense -- it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is a really obvious application for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except for saying that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
put down on the top of the sun surrounded up to nasa .
let &apos;s bring us back to something else .
this is even live in the internet , you can check it out .
this is a project of the name of photosynth , which is the really two different technologies together .
the one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research about computer vision , which by a noah er &apos;s , a university student at the university of washington , with steve coueing advising .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by sea adragon .
you can see that , if we create this kind of thinking , where we can penetrate through images , and make this experience of multidominances .
but the spatial structure of images here is actually important .
the computer algorithms have captured these pictures together so they took their real space into the real room , in which these recordings that have been done in the canadian rockies in the canadian rockies , because they see elements of stabilized , or panoramimaging imaging and these things were laid together in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you different environments .
those are the ones who are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to go straight to one of the original data advice of a coma , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you about what i think it was the punchline behind this technology , which is photosynubiquitous technology technology technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious , if you look at the environments we have on the website
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a field of notre dame , who &apos;s seen in the computer with autism from photographs of flickr , and they &apos;re just giving natasha in flickr , and they get pictures of pictures in t-shirts in t-shirts in t-shirts and so on the universities , and all of course represents a picture that was detected this model .
so these are all the chalth images , and they all relate to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
so , you know , i never believed that i finally work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that there are a lot of different types of cameras : all of these things like the fine cam to professional , a pretty large number of them that were packed together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by notre dame that &apos;s been recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and now we &apos;re going to collect data from all of the collective memory of the collective memory , like , is visual the earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these pictures are connected together , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes out of all the earth .
consider this as the sequel of stephen ony artist &apos;s virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something which is going to grow through the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s going to increase the benefits for the user using the treatment .
their own photos of your own photos that have a bit of metadata that has taken a different person .
now , if the effort has done , and we divide all these sacred whistles , and all of them are all over , my photo &apos;s notre gate , i can use it with all these data , and i can use it as a starting point into this room , in this metaverse , is to use the photos of other people , and therefore , to make a kind of other social experience of social
and of course , the streetproduct of all of these are the huge virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , not only through overflights or satellite images , and so on their own , through collective memory .
thank you .
so , do i understand it right ? their software is able to put that in a certain point , within the next few years , all the pictures that are used by somebody in the world , in the world ?
yes . she &apos;s not going to discover anything else .
if you want to make them a hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the inhaler in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting , if you think about the number of the semantic information , the many of these images have .
how if you do an web search for images where you enter sentences and the text of the site is a lot of information about it , which is the picture .
but how would it be , when the picture is connected to all their pictures ?
then the range of a semantic cross bond , and the abundance that makes it gets , really , really , enormously . it &apos;s a network effect .
blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . very lucky wish .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , which , i hope , in equilibrium with other things you &apos;ve heard already have heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make a couple of connections if you don &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start with what i call the official dogma .
official dogma from what ?
the official belief sentence of all the western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works : when the goal of the well-being of well-being is our citizens , it &apos;s all about the biggest of the freedom of the freedom of the individuals .
the reason for that is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , seemingly essential for human beings .
if people have freedom , each of us have been to do for ourselves to do things that would maximize our common self and nobody has to decide for us .
to maximize freedom to maximize freedom .
the more options you have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
this is , i think deep in our water supply , that it &apos;s not in the sense of being able to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives too .
i &apos;m going to give you a couple of examples of what we &apos;re doing for modern progress .
this is my supermarket . none big .
i just wanted to say anything about salathodows .
there &apos;s 200 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t sit the 10 different silk oils and 12 balvelicides that you could buy to make a huge number of your chest brosings in the improbable case , that &apos;s not the store for them .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
and then you go to the consumer electronics program to make a stereo , speaker , cd player , a casse-player , radio , mix , and in that one of electronics , many stereo , so many stereo facilities .
we can put together in about 55 million different stereo sites from the components that are being used in a store .
you have to admit that that &apos;s a big choice .
in other parts -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could get every telephone that you wanted to do as long as he came from ma bell .
you rented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the phone never broke .
these days are over .
we &apos;ve almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite it is in the middle -- mp3 playtrimmer , and crème bréd-lée fackel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now , they can be sure they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and ask that question .
now you know what the answer is in this question ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , that are very much more important than buying consent , which is the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer in the united states that you go to a doctor and tell you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says we might do a live , or we might make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a series of the benefits and the risks , and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if they say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shifting of the burden of choice for someone &apos;s decision for someone &apos;s fulfilling white , doctor -- to someone knows -- &quot; don &apos;t know the best as ill and therefore not in fact in the best constitution , and therefore not the best the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for writing drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , if you think about it , not because we buy them .
why do you putting them for us if we cannot buy ?
and the answer is : if you were to call the doctor at the next morning , and to request a change change .
something deeply as deep as our identity is now a question of choice how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t make any identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re making new kinds of times as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what one kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the standard premise was that almost everybody had one , and they could get so proud of how they could , and then they were so fast kids like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when they did .
today , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry now ?
shall i marry later ? should i have children , or do i make a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all asking questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer those questions , whether it means all the tasks that i relate to them and not get good news in my course course .
and indeed , they should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl explained , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day from every place on the planet -- to the peripher-ph hotel .
so , by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the wireless lan works .
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of trying to make jobs , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our children in soccer games , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry at other hip , and our laptop is probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all done , every minute that we &apos;re going to look at our kid at a mutilate football game , we also ask , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also , if the answer to the question is , no , it &apos;s certainly your experience of the football game of your child &apos;s worn very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look at , large things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say there were some options , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re seeing is this .
and the question is , are that good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all of all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to do something wrong about it .
all these options have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxically , is that it paralyzes it instead of free .
with so many options that you can choose , people are not very hard to decide at all .
so i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study about investment in voluntary age .
and a colon me had access to cash records from vanguard of vanguard , the giant fountains of about a million employees and many 2,000 jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that the labor owner was offered by two percent .
you provide 50 investment fund -- 10 percent fewer employees , you know , than if you pay only five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund , which are the choice of choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to vote it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and , of course , never comes tomorrow .
you understand that that doesn &apos;t only mean that people need to eat dog food , if you go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go , it means the decisions that make great investment promises of their labor .
not interested in progress , up to 5,000 u.s. dollars on the profession that would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of a lot of options .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really really , if it &apos;s for all sides , right ?
they don &apos;t want to pick the wrong investment fund , but the wrong salatms .
so , that &apos;s a effect . the other effect is that if we overcome paralysis and make a decision we end up less pleasure with the outcome of the choices than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is taken over the great selection of different salatdressters , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which salathoang has been doing perfect ? it &apos;s easy to suggest that you could have a different decision is that you know that &apos;s going on this decision , and that might be negative , and this satisfaction , and that of the responsibility that you &apos;ve made of their
the more options , the more options , the more thing it &apos;s easier to regret at all is the disappointment to vote .
secondly , what economists call opbutation is going .
dan gilbert has made a big point today by telling me how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare it .
well , if there are a lot of alternative issues about considering , it &apos;s just attractive features to imagine in alternative that they excluded , which makes you less happy with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here is what you should have to think .
so here is a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive properties .
gorgeous beach . great day . you have all for yourself .
what could be better about ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattan is gone away .
i could sit directly before my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s taking two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility , day about day , a great parking lot .
oppertation is going to reduce the happiness that we get through our preferences , even when what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities , the more attractive properties of these selection are going to take into account in the opperinsuaddress .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon does some statements .
he makes a statement now to live now and maybe to do things again .
but more important point that he does is , always , who is deciding for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and those other things might have a lot of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be less attractive .
three : eskalise expectations .
this struck me when i was going to share my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only one thing that was only there , and they bought them , and they were doing bad , they were incredibly useless , and if they were they carried up enough enough and they wore enough enough , they start to feel enough .
so for a lot to buy new jeans after a lot of years of the age of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sellers , said , &quot; do you want to wake up , slightly more or wide ?
do you want buttons or square ? rocks or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut down the bottom down , ridicule , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i would like the kind of thing that used to be the only way .
he had no idea what was this , so i spent an hour to try all of this damn jeans , and the store -- and i tell the truth -- the best passport jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i better have better . all of these choices i could make it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it myself .
the reason for it felt worse with me , with all these kinds of options , my expectations for which good for a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no expectations when they just had in a way .
when they came to 100 species , they would have to be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i got to do , and what i had was , which i had seemed to be disappointing in comparison to what i expected .
the addition of opportunities in the lives of people are inevitably increasing the expectations of people who are going to be these options .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even when the results are good .
no one in the marketing is white in the world , because if you were , you , you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that was that the sooner was worse than anything that was worse than anything that was worse for the people who were possible to make the very comfortable surprise .
now , in the world we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as a expectation -- the best for whom you have to hope is the things that things are as good as you expect it from them .
you &apos;ll never be a pleasant surprise , because your expectations , my expectations , home are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a little autobiographical moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have been able to do it anymore . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
but besides , not always that bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the purchase of a bad wine on the jeans when there &apos;s only one way to buy , that if they &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is , the answer . the world is responsible . what could do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available from jeans , and they buy one of the slides , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible ?
so , it &apos;s clear that the answer is to the question : you .
they could be able to do it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the sink , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , they feel frustrated about it , they blame themselves .
in clinical depression in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only one , but an significant practitioner to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , that people have learned is because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain their own experience self , think it would be their fault .
and so the image of reference is that it &apos;s going to be better for us , generally , is objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is official dogma , which is one that we all think of right now , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there is there &apos;s no question for a choice better than not , but it doesn &apos;t the more choice better than something .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point long for the selection of our well-being .
now , as a reference question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a basic question of question , which is the thing about thinking about the thinking , which is all of these choices that require into the developed societies is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them , their problem is not the great choice .
your problem is , they have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is an odd problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating about is so frustrating , and steve levitt has told you yesterday about how this expensive and heavy car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they &apos;re even upset .
you care for us to be worse .
if something of the people of our society allows us to make decisions such as a few societies had shifted to a little bit of choice , not just improved people &apos;s lives , but that would be improved .
economists call this a par-to-process of improvement .
income distribution is going to make sure that it &apos;s going to be better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great choices are pladding .
finally , read this cartoon , please read this cartoon , and you say , &quot; oh , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold fish . &quot;
dirkening fantasy , a short-pt view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
and the more thinking about it , the more i came to think about the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the gold fishing glass , so it &apos;s all possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold fishing glass , so that &apos;s all possible , cut happiness .
it elevate the paralysis and down the happiness .
everybody needs a gold fish .
this is almost limited to the complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhaner of a metaphorical gold fish is a recipe for misery , and i guess , catastrophe .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what it might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , from a new point , we launch biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code in a new phase of biology by creating new life .
we always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different techniques to simplify them to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to wonder whether we can regenerate life , or whether we can create new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma var , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a even smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to deliver about a hundred genes to 500 or so like that .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to ours , trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we all look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very likely to lead this would lead .
and so we decided that it was the only way to look at this chromosome is actually synthetic , which allows us to variation the individual components and put some of those fundamental questions .
and so we began , can we can make a chromosome synthetic ?
could it make these really large molecules that hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , can we start logging the chromosome ?
there &apos;s a chromosome is a piece of chemical material , by the way , by the way .
our steps on our steps of digitizing life were exponentially .
our ability to write a genetic code is very slow , but it &apos;s also evolving , and our last point would be in the exponential curve now .
we started with it 15 years ago .
it took a few years ago by the bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
so it turns out , dna is synthetic synthetic ways .
there are tens of tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s an exponential process , so the longer you make a piece a piece , the more likely .
so we had to develop a new method that we put together these little bits and correct the mistakes .
this was the first attempt , starting with digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s killing bacteria a little virus virus .
we made small pieces , made it made out of error correction , and it had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage was taken as we took this piece of heavy chemical and put into a bacterium , and it started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed coli .
i recently talked about the oil business industry , and they said she was doing this model exactly .
they &apos;re laughing more than you do here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software can actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to keep going on , and we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 580,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in cassec from the size of the size of the cassees to understand the size of the casseties .
design is the key is key , and if you start with digital information in the computer , this digital information is going to be very cheap .
when we sequenced the genome first earlier , when we sequenced the genome of 1995 at a mistake per bit of accident per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes on 30 mistakes , if we used the original sequence , it would never be possible to drive .
a part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and they need to have to integrate with other 50-letters pairs , to build smaller sub-units to fit them together .
we &apos;ve got a unique elements here .
you might have heard we &apos;ve built watersigns .
think about it : we have a four-letter code , a , c , g and t .
triplets of this letters called about 20 amino acids ; there is a single impact for each of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just wrote in the beginning .
some people were disappointed that they didn &apos;t have poetry .
we &apos;ve been so designed so we designed the pieces so we &apos;ve just been able to break them down with enzymes , there are enzymes that make those repair and again .
and we started making pieces , starting with lots of the five to the 7th of letters , put this together to make it together over 24,000-letter pieces to bring them together , up to 72,000 .
in each stage , we produced these pieces in advance so we could sequence it , because we tried to create a very bold process , what you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we tried to get the point of the automation .
so , this is sort of a basketball playoff .
if we get to these right big bits -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- then these won &apos;t just grow in e. coli , all the chances of modern biological biology , and so we ended up with other mechanisms .
we knew that the homologist recombination mechanism that uses biology to repair dna that can merge those pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radioduron the three million pbs .
you can see in the upper field , the chromosome just drops apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s added all over again .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be dry , they can even live in a vacuum vacuum .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in space , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has a nasa out there .
so here &apos;s a bunch of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually we &apos;ve used to have hedent-proof mechanisms using the right design of the pieces that we put it into it , and yeast automatically fit together .
this is not rocket micromicroscope , it &apos;s a regular microscopic photograph .
it &apos;s a big molecule molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
so that &apos;s footage over six seconds .
this is publication that we &apos;ve done recently .
that &apos;s over 580,000 letters in the genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure that &apos;s ever created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we print it by a paper &apos;s size , if we print it from 10 , there would be 142 pages , just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , with a virus , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in eukaryonich how we &apos;re doing : you just take the nuclear out , and there &apos;s another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the sound .
so archaebacteria , in the cell is integrated into the cell , but it recently has shown that you can do a full transplant of a chromosome from a cell to the other and see that &apos;s going to happen .
we had the chromosome from a microspecies , which is , literally , these two times from humans , and we gave a few extra genes to get this chromosome , and we locked it on the enzyme to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing than we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very mature graphs .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
well , in fact , we thought is , but we tried to bring the process further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of them , each times thousands of individuals in a second to a species .
so people who are thinking about evolution as a gene that changed in a moment have missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called restrictions called the restrictionsiters called the ones that have digested dna .
the chromosome that was the chromosome in the cell , none ; the chromosomes we added .
it was isolated in the cell and realized the other chromosome as alien use digestion , and so we just had one cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s coloring blue because of the genes that we added .
and after a very short period , it &apos;s been lost all the characteristics of species , and we went around a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the proteins , and as we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re transstructile .
it may sound like genomic tunie , but we can move by changing the software dna , things quite dramatically dramatically .
now i argued that i &apos;m saying that this is not the thing -- that &apos;s based on a 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new form of the chamber explosion based on this digital design based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re going to grow up from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
in order it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are in 1946 , and within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food means with dreams and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to be to offer it for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million hooks per day .
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , the co2 from this material ends into the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric school industry had a dozen of the components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
and we &apos;re entering the very first line of the limits of biological reality and those of our imagination .
we &apos;ve now we have technologies because of these rapid degrees systems to do what we call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot to build millions of chromosomes in the day .
if you think about these 20 million different different genes or optimize these processes to optimize octan or drugs new vaccines , we can change with just a small team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just conventional selection . we can select to life , production of chemicals or fuel production production and so on .
this is a picture of active design software that we &apos;re working on , in fact , with which you &apos;re starting to design and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
now we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
you have seen corn , corn , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve we have about the two-meter and third generation , which are going to be the much higher meat lives , like octan or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is a huge impact , without the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , is when we see co2 as an initial material , and that &apos;s why we working with cells .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and this is about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different kinds of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about a one-and-a-half miles deep , almost boiling water temperatures .
it &apos;s turning carbon dioxide in methane to use hydrogen as a source of energy .
we can study whether we can use the co2 cells that could just be brought down to the production , converting the co2 into fuel , to drive this process .
within a brief periods of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moderate goals , like the $ petrochemical industry , right ? if you can &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? is a central source of energy .
but the same thing is , we &apos;re working on to use the same approaches to the development of vaccine .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year behind the back , and you have a dollar for a little bit , if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by making reconstructed vaccines in the investigation .
this is how the future could look like with changes with changes , today , the evolution of evolution is accelerating with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryans .
we &apos;re more light years of making humans better . our goal is that we have a chance to survive for a long time to survive it may possibly do . thank you very much . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave myself an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come to explain to you how the machine works .
so , it &apos;s far . and for everyone who hadn &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that ever happened -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that were less than a billionth of a second after the universe has known -- and up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just staggering more ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these mini-big sequencing pictures in detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called a atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
on the 10th year last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s got enormous nuts in the control of the control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first blue bias , which is coming back the whole way around the lhc , to make sure of a fraction of the lhc , to make an rain from the detector from the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a huge victory .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest jucro , or this , when anybody came up with the google site and found the front page .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wire here -- that golden wires here .
these wires lead to 13-thousand dollars when the machine is running on high performance .
now the engineers are going to look at you and say , &quot; no one you don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford it because if you cool them very far , you &apos;ll call them like that superconductor .
so at minus 271 degrees , cooler than the room between stars , these wires can keep the tension .
in one of the connections , between the nine-thousand magnets , in the lhc , it &apos;s got a manual .
so the wires , the way , the wires were heated up less and more and 13 thousand , suddenly , of course , sple-electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even extraordinary , if you imagine that the magnet is taking over 20 tons and shifted over 30 centimeters .
so we were , we damage about 50 of the magnet .
and then had to take them out of what we did .
we concommissioned it , reformers , rererepair them .
they &apos;re all going back to their way .
at the lhc , the lhc will be connected again .
we will turn it down and expect to be able to gather the next data in june or of course , and we continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in some ways , such accidents , the debate about science and engineering of these things . it &apos;s easy to reject this .
i think it &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our borders , form the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my roommate with my english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i guess , as he pursued the usable experiments of his textbook , michael faraday , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the evolution of the human mind , that there are no mysteries in nature , that we are going to be more happy , and there &apos;s no new worlds to
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , life-loving and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
however , i have a little bit shorter in my life , and i &apos;ve been going to happen to my career , which is to rethink my relationship to this work completely .
this strange event like this was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called a condentist , who was going to eat , ok , love , love -- that , in the world , when all my previous books of my previous event , was a great event event , the international .
the result is , no matter where i get treated , i &apos;m going to be more than i &apos;m running .
seriously -- seriously -- the demise .
for example , they &apos;re very concerned about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you feel that you &apos;ve never got that success ?
do you feel afraid that you &apos;re going to write your whole life , and have never create a book that interest in the world never ?
okay , that makes sense .
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that for over 20 years ago , when i first told a teenager , when i first told the writer , that i wanted to be faced with the same kind of fear of anxiety .
people said , don &apos;t you feel frightened , ever to have any success ?
don &apos;t you feel afraid that you &apos;re running the humiliation of a dock ?
do you feel afraid you take your life your life , and you never have something that you &apos;re going to die on a blank hall , you &apos;re going to die -- your mouth filled with the bitter wash ash ?
it &apos;s about , you know .
and the question -- the short answer to all these questions is : is that way .
yeah , i fear all these things .
and they always had .
and i &apos;ve afraid a lot more things that no one would be accurate .
like algae -- and other horrible things .
but , when it comes to write about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently : why ?
is this sound ?
is it logical that , by someone , should you expect that he &apos;s afraid to do the work that he was going to do ?
and what about the creative enterprise is going on with the creative enterprise , that they make us insecure about the reciprozing mental states -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a chemist at the 40 years that he asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
with your chemical blocking block , john -- how do you do that ?
it just wasn &apos;t really , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemists have gotten over the centuries of alcohol of alcohol of alco-south depression .
and we &apos;re writers but having this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative part of the genres seem to have , mentally unstable .
all they have to do is to look at the bitter death rates of the first of the 20th century alone , the young and often died of their own .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually be done by the genocide , he seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman machmaan shortly from his death in his last interview , which is keeping me killed a little bit .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life work .
but we don &apos;t sit once , if we heard someone like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements for a long time , somehow , we have the notions of our bodies and collective statements that creativity and suffering are kind of , and that art -- at the arts -- at the end -- always to go to the ocean .
the question i &apos;d like to ask each of you here is : is this idea of being completely right ?
do you think about it ? because with only a centimeter , thinking -- i feel not probably with this perception .
i find them numb .
and i find it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them taken out of the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative learning .
and i definitely know that for me , for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , begin to begin to deflect this dark path of speculation -- especially in the fact that i &apos;ve seen in my career .
it &apos;s called -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i am only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 workforce in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that anything that i &apos;m going to be writing from now is about the world than the work that came after the curved success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;ll notice it right , because we &apos;re all kind of like a friend of mine -- it &apos;s quite likely that my biggest success was happening behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that can get somebody to start at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;d better to do this work i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a few times of the reflection , i seem to be able to continue to write a kind of local psychological constructive engineering .
i kind of now , i have to find a way to look at a certain distance between me and illustrate my very natural insult about how the reaction will be on the written .
while i searched for models in the last year , to do that , i &apos;ve been looking at the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you might have a better or responsible ideas about it than we had creative risks with creative risks with the emotional .
this is what leads me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end again .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divinative spirit that comes from a distant , unknown resource to people -- from unexplicable , unknown reasons .
the greeks called the divine builder of creativity for creativity .
in socrates , he was known that he believed he had a damon who was given away from a distance .
the roman idea was the same idea , called this kind of body of body &apos;s propriety mind , a superior genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
and they believed that was a genius of this kind of magical divine bee , who believed that it was literally in the walls of an artist in the walls -- something like dobling , the house/ , the home of the home , and sort of the work , and design out and design the profession in the work of labor .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s it , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological constructive , protecting you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so way , right ?
the artist of aging was protected in a certain thing , like , for example , too taczisism , right ?
if your work was great , you didn &apos;t look at anything for you , and everybody knew that you had this body genius that helped you .
when your work was working -- not completely your fault , right ?
everybody knew their genius was fine .
so , the people in the west have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s take the human individual into the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no room for mystic creatures of creatures by divination .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity has completely entirely from an individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who call this kind of genius -- instead that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a mingling person to allow you think that he thinks that , or it &apos;s like the vessel , like the pelvis and the essence of the divine , creative mysterious , unfamiliar mysterious , is a little bit better responsibility to make you better responsibility to make human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
so it turns relaxation , and it creates all these unaccessible expectations for success .
i think that this success has wiped out our artists of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps to go to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and to return to the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t take that thought-rational history from 500 years of humanism simply in an 18-minute lecture .
and so there are certainly people in this audience who are really passionate about academic doubt concerns about the notion of -- basically -- fat , the people who pursue their consequences and their depletions on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to throw out is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes a lot of sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about trying to explain the utterly crazy thing of creative process .
one process that &apos;s a process -- as everybody knows , who &apos;s ever trying to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always related .
in fact , in fact , it can feel like paranormal , sometimes .
i was a encounter a encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , which is over 90 years old , and she told me that when she was going to worked at the village virginia , she said she would be feeling to be able to be a poem about the landscape on them .
she would say it was like a donation of air .
the land would roll to escape .
she felt , if it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that in a moment , she could only do one thing , and that was -- in her words -- the race of the devil .
they ran like the devil to the house was tracking during this poem , and it was the only thing that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pencil so she had to catch it through her , and tie .
in other words , they were not fast enough . they ran and run and run , but they didn &apos;t the house through them , and she checked it down and she said it would go around over the country , and she said it was going to continue to a different poet .
and then there was these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget that -- she said it was eye &apos;s eye in which it was almost adapted .
so , you know the house , and he &apos;s looking for the paper , and the poem pulls through it , and she grabs a pencil than it goes through her and then -- she was like it was like to reach her other hand with her other hand .
she said that was the poem on his tail , and it went back into her body , and she took over the paper paper .
so , these opportunities came out of the poem for the poem , and it stays down on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i thought about this , this is creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening .
this isn &apos;t like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the canal !
i &apos;m a makd . in order to work work , i have to get up every day and sweating sweating , and i &apos;m really inconvenient .
but even i got to my malanimal , sometimes it bites this thing .
and i guess many of you have too well .
even i had worked or ideas that ideas that came through for me through a source that i really can &apos;t .
what is that thing ?
and how do we deal with losing our minds ourselves , but even maintaining mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how to create this is the musicians of the musician , i could . i had to interview him for a couple of years ago .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life was tom deleted modern artist who was trying to do this uncontrolled creative composition that would sit in and conserve with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me he went to a faster road in los angeles , and there all changed for him .
he was driving up at high speed as he suddenly hear a piece of a tune on a tune , which is about inspiration often , and it &apos;s hard for him for him , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s praunting , he can &apos;t persuade .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he didn &apos;t have a cassette tape .
so he begins , this old configurations up into him , like , as i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll be haunted by that song .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of doing it , he stopped .
he &apos;d finished the whole thought and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; well , sorry , can you not see me driving ? &quot;
i think , i think , what i &apos;m looking at a song ?
if you really want to do , come back to a cheap moment when i can take care of you .
if you &apos;re no other way if you &apos;re in other spaces .
go and wave leonard cohen .
it changed the process has changed .
not the work of self . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and heavy attention , which surrounds it was when he took the genius out of himself , where he was doing nothing in trouble and he returned him afterwards where he was sort of him got , he realized that it had to be an ongoing change , enqualified , eager .
it could give up an unprecedented , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange thing , seemingly happiness , which wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it changed the way i worked , and it even saved me .
and this idea of mine , when i was in the front of my writing process of being , right , right , love , love , i noticed in one of these craters , and not , if we work on something and didn &apos;t work , you start to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book that was written .
not just bad , but worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just test the project .
but then i remembered how tom was talking about the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i spoke to my comments to a blank corner of the room .
i was talking about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you , and i don &apos;t know when this book is brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you can you see that i &apos;m investing in , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want it better , better , you &apos;ve got to check up here and join your benefit .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do -- you know what , then for the devil .
i &apos;ll keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to admit to emulate that i was here for my work today .
because , ... at the end , the way it follows . prior to centuries ago , in the desert north korea , there were a fiercere of holy dancers and music that were eaten for long hours , until dawn .
and they were very strong , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something rare , something special happened , one of the character was actually overwhelming .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that all of you live in their lives such a performance .
it was like time , and the days and the dancer through a kind of pente , and he didn &apos;t do anything more than he ever had before -- 1,000 nights before . but all of it had combined .
suddenly , it didn &apos;t seem more longer seemed to be human .
it was illuminated from the inside , and it &apos;s illuminating by the bottom , and it opens up with a divine fire .
when something happened back then , people knew what that was . they called it at his name .
they put together the hands together and they started singing : &quot; the &quot; allah h , allah , allah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interestingly historic historic news note : when the mocellular south spain launched them , the act of language changed from the centuries of radio radio h , of allah , allah , allah , olé , has been still going to paint and waenserbers .
when a writer in spain has something inplausible , something magical , &quot; abasih , olé , omé , allah , allah , great , bravo , beautiful , there is a pasiss looking on god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , part of the things followed at the next morning , when the dancers would wake themselves , and they &apos;re 11 a.m. at a tuesday , and he &apos;s not wearing a fifth of god .
it &apos;s just an ancient patient with a painful flyer , and maybe it &apos;s never going to get back to those heights .
and maybe somebody will never call the god name again when it comes , but what does he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corrector of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very close to piss , if you don &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from them .
if you might just believe that they &apos;re a lighter -- from an unlikely source for a superior time of your life that will be passed on somebody else , if they finished .
when we start thinking about this , things change .
so i started thinking , and i think of security in the last few months , as i was working on the book , which is soon coming out -- than the dangerous , frightening , the hard , the privilege of recidest success .
what i have to say , when i &apos;m crazy about it , don &apos;t freak out .
it wasn &apos;t .
make your job .
forever for your contribution there , whatever he wants to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb god &apos;s genius , if you put on the side of your side , you decide to show a delightful of miracles through your effort , then juggling it .
and if not , dance and dance .
and by the &quot; olé ! is a little bit of that .
i think about it , and i feel that we should teach .
you know , olé ! take care of all of all of this , just for sure that you have only the only human love and your credit to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate the arctic ice caps that had over three million years of the size of the bottom of the lower 48 states , 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t sound very enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thick of ice .
in a way , the arctic is the arctic heart of our global climate change .
it grows in the winter , and it fragmented in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-lapse picture that happened in the last 25 years .
the adult ice is placed with red .
as you can see , it builds up on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter , and it fragmented in the summer .
this is the permanent ice , five years old or older , it &apos;s almost like blood , it &apos;s almost blood out of the body .
it &apos;s 25 years , it will be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming of the frozen reason around the arctic ocean is depositing the size of frozen carbon , which , when it blows up from microbes to methane from microbes .
so compared to the total amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it could double that amount , if we cross this critical point .
already , in some shallow lakes in alaska , there &apos;s rampant methane from itself .
professor , katey walter der university in alaska is in alaska , with a different way traveled to a different flat seas last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re okay . the question is , how is it going to happen .
and one reason is that huge heat warming heats up above the north .
this is a year of a year migrating water stream .
but the volume of volume more than ever before .
this is the canary in southwest greenland .
if you want to know , like sea level , sea ice ice goes up , you put it into the sea .
these rivers are taking place .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
last month of melts , the entire continent is now a negative ice footprint .
and the west antarctica , which is emerging over a couple of underwater islands is particularly strong in the block .
this is about 20 feet sea height , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , look at the top of new lakes that were missing a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting water .
in the andes , in the andes is this glacier , the drinking water source for this city .
the water sheets have been bigger .
but when they burst , most of the water is falling away .
in california , a 40-40 percent reduction in the sierra ella of the sierra ns .
this is the memory basin .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
this austrocle in the whole world is a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have been actually confined into a really extraordinary , and it has never gained unprecedented .
four times so many in the last 30 years of previous 75 years .
this is a completely unsustainable terrain .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years we &apos;ve created 70 million tons of co2 from co2 -- 25 million tons of tons per day in the oceans .
if you look at the area of the eastern pacific , the american continent is west , and you see the indian subcontinent , where there is a kite drop in the sea .
the biggest majority factor for global warming to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most important problem .
the united states are one of the two biggest kointers , combined with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other coal facilities .
but we begin to see a change .
these are the ones that have been rejected in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
well , there &apos;s a political dispute in our country .
and the coalition of cooking and odustrien have spent a quarter-billion-year 30-foot year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me something .
around christmas , at night in tennessee , at home , a billion tons of asthma .
you saw it in the news , you know ?
this is in our entire country is the second largest waste of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the ad in the koad industry was around christmas .
frosty the plant is a happy , happy bursche .
it &apos;s got it in the skin and abundance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy .
hairsty , the coal man gets cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and loving , and workers stay in high nets and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain worker is the head of mashilcharcoal .
let me tell you clear , al gore , nancy hoposi , harry sed , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance has been called two installations of climate protection .
this is one , part of them .
in coalerg we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve taken it to the top stage , to spend a significant amount of money on a commercial action on the path to get the truth on coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells still well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave you leave that .
there &apos;s a lot of it . you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean carbon factory .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here changes everything .
so look at that , this is now today , clean coal technologies .
finally , the positive alternative opportunities shared with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , climate crisis .
the red thread that comes together is our dependence of carbon-based material like dirty coal and foreign oil oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of that misadvantage .
take america with 100 percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help us stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
it &apos;s new percent . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
one of the quickest ways , our dependence of old , dirty power material that sparks our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make well-paid jobs .
supply america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want a long way , go together . &quot;
we need to get far done , quickly .
thank you .
so i want to start to think of you in the time of your childhood , as they were playing with the building .
while they realized how to remove the hands and intervene and moves the slippery , they actually learned to think about thinking and problems through understanding and changing the spatial connection .
spatial thinking is intimately connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my academic advisti and my colleagues , jelled calanitha , i began to wonder , what if we use of computers like a digital finger upward on a flat run surface ... what if we could intervene with both hands and put it could be able ?
the question was so heartening that we decided to explore the answer and evolved mressing wisdom .
in short , a sidor is a interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can hit your movements and you have a screen and a radio .
more importantly , physically , why you can only make it out of your hands and make it open .
and the siids are an example of a new generation of aid for manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to become physical and develop a conscious awareness for their movements , to see each other and the hostile qualities of activities with them with them , then we can start with research of new interaction species .
i &apos;ll i start with a couple simple examples .
so this is based for video refigurations configurations , and if i put it into a direction , the video will play forward ; when i turn it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and those interactive portraits are taking their each other .
so when i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s their interest .
if you &apos;re going to mix your mind , you &apos;ll notice , and you can get a little nervous .
and they are also feeling their motions and incures .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we learned to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like to extract color from color , as you get it with fluids .
in this case , we have three corcharities of color pots configurations , and i can use them to pour color in the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we &apos;re cutting it , we can helicopter a little bit .
there are also some kind of nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logikgames , where we give people the opportunity for people the opportunity of the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m doing with a very simple program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boghh .
basically , you &apos;re going to get every ride on every sizy letter , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , this is tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed up together , and you have a new letter and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some children who came up on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them into it , and i took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
that &apos;s our youngest chapter right there on the right .
and it turns out that he was going to have the idea that he wanted to get scanned .
so for him , they were just collateral .
this is an interactive ringing .
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
this is fat .
he can bring new characters in the scene by putting the siftable of the table that shows this character .
this is where he makes the sun up .
the sun rises .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by putting the sikins , and it puts it to side , he can take the characters interacting ...
it &apos;s got to invent my own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and he can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example of that i have time today is to show it , is a music issue for live labor , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the sities of the eye , like runner , bass , bass .
each has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can store these sound in the sequence that you can arrange into any kind of pattern .
and you store them by simply taking a note of a kind of sound made of a sequence of greuming .
there are effects that you can change live , like reverberation and filter .
you put it together with a certain tone and then tends to hire it .
and then more effects like speed and silent , which you &apos;re doing on all the sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we begin to put the lead out in two sequence of captive reunizing and putting them into a series of input , extend them and add a little more of the voice .
i &apos;ll add a bass now .
now i &apos;m going to do something else doing this .
and now i combine the filter with the wing , so that i can steer the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by turning this speed in one direction or another direction .
and now i &apos;m doing that filter with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can put the sequence as it &apos;s going on .
and so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but it can improvise , to get it apart or more easily .
and finally , i can browse the whole sequence by running the silent intal for the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new humanures that work better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you part of this new design world and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with on the way is that we are on the verge of this new generation of valuation to interact with digital media , bring information into our world that corresponds to our demands .
thank you .
and i &apos;m looking forward to everybody .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m pleased is that i &apos;m there .
yes , so , what would be biohacking ?
so , i need to get a little bit , which is biohacking , with the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing a couple of years now with the biohacking , and i started this , because i just wanted to know more deeply , and i wanted to do it before , in the way i learned in the study .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was an curiosity , and i just wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
now , i think that molecular biology is generally in general now , of course , biotech , anything that you do , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important now , now very important , and much , much more important is going to be in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like these all the most important technologies are changing in plants .
there are craig venter in the u.s. a , which is trying to make biofuel , which is gasoline from algae .
then there are there any things that are going to be in the everyday life , but most of the people who are not aware of , for example , the grain enzymes that allow us to wash with four degrees of accuracy , are also more technological , more technological .
and the lists can continue to continue .
and so from the interest in this technology , at this technology , i just went on .
so , what now hack ?
most people know the most people recognize this out of the software .
so , in hacking , and then it will be , in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere from one and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of cool thing for the hackery scene , because it doesn &apos;t hit what they actually did what they actually started and what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s the software hackers , in the &apos; 70s , eighmal years of computer tinkering , and it was born the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , creative way of solving a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technological problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a gateway problem , it can also be a viable problem , what simplify things that simplify things , and how can you take it up , and how can you make it more or how to do better .
and it &apos;s become a piece of it with software , but there &apos;s also in the fmri section , there &apos;s also a whole wall scene that &apos;s going to make all kinds of the built-in all possible things .
and now in biology , and what i want to do is take this metaphor from synthetic biology is that biology is actually an information science , because , the d.n.a code is a more equal code , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , so it &apos;s a real matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and not just cyber matter , and not just cyber matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and so you can buy it , and so you can screw it , so , and i find it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to be a lot .
that actually , this really took two thousand eight , really , these are networks .
there is there &apos;s a grain at hacker , which is originally from switzerland , which is between europe and with cooperation in india , in india , in india , in india , there are members of people around the world .
that &apos;s that a more artistic aversion , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers are working together with scientists , in collaboration with these technologies and trying to process and process how to process the creative line , in fact , there &apos;s museum exhibitions and yes , all sorts of things .
but it &apos;s always about finding a way of cleaning access to a way of making a relationship .
and then there &apos;s a do-it-passive organic dot , d.i.y.com .
this is from the united states a network , which is more of the kind of forum , where you think about it and talked online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and they also have a little bit of economies , and then they &apos;re going to be also like , yes , in favor .
and based on these networks that have done all the popular has actually evolved in a scene that i would like to quickly portraits .
here in the picture on the upper left , you see biological ones , which is a hackerspace , basically a school , a private school , a non-profit training , where everybody can come .
children , old , all kinds of people go around , and they just went ahead and look at a laboratory , and look at what you can do when this laboratory protocolle .
here &apos;s a group in the bottom is a group in indonesia , highway &apos;s natural , which is , but there &apos;s a long time .
it has more longer than these two two networks .
they also look at the artistic component of biological materials , and , you know , electronics , and they also combine it in a pretty valid way .
a group of ankara , who i once met a while ago , this was a student group that would like to convey more on the public more than what they learn in universities , and they have made them in the street to make and try to explain people , which is the d...a .
and i went up on top of the other picture of a lecture in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with a show .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s actually quite young people , but the only thing that it all shared is this fascination on technology .
and what you can do with it , and also targeted to society and ask questions , so , ok , what do you know what do you want to do with you , do you pay attention to you so that ?
so , okay , so , to hack biology , you need some material .
you need of course , you need biological materials , and you need tools , but you need tools , and then that &apos;s a laboratory .
and in fact , as you can normally understand under a lab , that &apos;s kind of small-scale machines , extremely expensive , extremely distance , only for professionals , trained academics with phtitles and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , that &apos;s actually that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because each of any of any of any coffee cars actually evolved technology than most of the lab devices , it really is .
and he &apos;s session with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger is trying to make together a minimally abmitle , then a heat coople , and , yes , it &apos;s going to be , and the bacteria , and then it changed bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s already been a soup that he has left too long , too many times .
i then , in my lab at home , i tried to scale a little bit , and then i &apos;d take a little bit of prosthetic gear on ebay and a little d.nn.artist , trying to do a father , so that / n.a finger printing .
that shouldn &apos;t be a joke yet , but .
in the bottom , you in the picture , you see the lab , in anleadership , so this is such an excuse garage with also as much of the lab robotic chormlight that the universities has gone up in paris , a group in paris , which is initiated and pretty interesting things , and so i want to make a project .
and this is biotipping , and it &apos;s also mentioned , hackerspace , this one sort of folk school in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , so you can see it &apos;s relatively relatively heterotenous , so , there &apos;s some people who are doing this in home , so far too much larger organizations that much larger organizations tend to actually take more sophisticated in civic .
but yet , the approach is that it &apos;s going to be simple and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , okay now , there &apos;s a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people know the people who are enjoying and so on .
and then , from do-it-casual bio , the founders came , and said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ve got to get a real meeting now , and then organized two discoveries , one in london , two thousand , and very quickly in the united states , in san francisco .
and then , there &apos;s this thing , yes , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values , and what is what &apos;s the objective of our target , our foundations ?
and then we &apos;ve done this code-of-thing .
that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just got his wishes , his and , what moved him down , then , then .
so , i think , was going to be a good code .
and that &apos;s not connection , but that &apos;s actually , yes , i think , it &apos;s pretty well done , people are very convinced about this .
and we also tried to bring it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not like that .
so , i think we &apos;re from the biohacker scene , in the way , a step further than the academic world .
so , let &apos;s do that for projects actually ?
one project that project that i did with the hacking network in switzerland was that we wanted to build a so-called synthetic trap or an optical pinzette .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then you move into that focus , then that &apos;s then captured there , like such as a tractor in principle .
it really works , this is done in academic , and we used to think , okay , we get this one , then we &apos;ve taken a webcam , and then it turns out the lens , turn up , and then you have a microscope , it &apos;s increasing about four hundred times .
this is the bottom down .
and then we went down a d.v.d oven , and then the masking gets the laser , and then it tries to focus on this camera .
and it hasn &apos;t worked , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
and so another project that french group of paris , it worked pretty cool .
and that &apos;s it that is , in fact , a brain wave engine , this e.e.g , or something , so he &apos;s busy with neurobiology , his god is sam .
he then got that this helmet because of the cooperation that went into the museum .
and then the visitors could go into the room , put on this chair , put that helmet .
then they measured your brainwaves , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was quite a fortune project .
another thing about the thing from the united states , which has to do with this father &apos;s story , is the p.c.r , which is polymer-driven response , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to multiply , seas...a , mix fragments so you can make them visible .
so if i do this all the profile in the scene , then go back , collect any hair strand , and then they turn them up this way , and then they say , okay , this hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that do something like this are pretty expensive , which you buy commercial , the cheapest step on four thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in hobbysection , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be much more .
so this is just an application of many , you can do with it .
and these have been there with so two two builders , and said , okay , we make it easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , you know , we &apos;ve got filled with open-source hardware , electronics , electronics , all of these things that are together and are the cheapest guidance of these kinds of these devices .
i think it &apos;s sort of a five-gram dollar or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s not cheap now , but it &apos;s still very cheap , but it &apos;s in any case in a framework where it &apos;s clearly going to be available .
so , i think , is a very daunting hack .
a project i started doing was building a gene gun .
e-e-gun is , yes , like a kind of rab-up gun , it &apos;s about so far , two inches or so .
you charge nn in the d.n..gold2 particles , and the gold particles put in these air pressure , and then i put it on to the onion , and then you put it up with that .
so the device that you see here doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype that , but it looked like a little bit , and it looked like this one branch , this thing , this thing , and electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure , but the pressure was too high , that thing was broken .
and then i took a cappeson and put it into it .
one string lion , if you make the full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about four or six thousand paybar .
and so , with that , you can make the particles very quickly speed , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device cost about five thousand dollars upwards or something like the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essential in principle .
so this is the moment that &apos;s the crux of the scene , continuing to increase this availability of technology and extend the information and the understanding that more people can engage it .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have fairly little suspicion of it , and also no opportunity to form .
because , if you just read about it , like a peer literature , that &apos;s not the same way when you do it yourself or saw .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make more meaningful decisions more meaningful to society , and to talk about , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to be able to do it and understand and understand and understand .
and so the result , then , they provide open and citizen science .
so that &apos;s that is going to be done as citizens , is putting together with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the crux of the biohackers .
these are the people who &apos;ve been officially covered on the website , in the d.i.y.biological dotcom .
that &apos;s a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also plotted in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , i think , there are fewer people who are put up , actually .
so i know about some , i know for some of them .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual guys .
in fact , with these hackerspaces , these places put together together .
and this is all in the beginning .
as i said , it has only been started .
and hackerspaces , so the computer hackerspaces , because the middle base in berlin was the first , ninety-by-100 five-five-five-five-year-old .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that are represented all over the world .
and of course , of course , that we &apos;re also going to spread up , and then we can also adapt too well , so that you can still be involved in .
and i &apos;d invite everybody to engage and try and try and test .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curiosity , you get enough energy , you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hey .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that is very moving me as a design designer , but also in the field of research , in the research setting , and in front of all things in the field of user .
and that &apos;s where you encounter people in an interactive media so that they can use this interactive media , and that they generate a very satisfying experience .
well , i think that the interactive media is involved in our archaic , cognitive models , which is the paradigm that have been programmed in our biological memory very recently , and that we can make it back through interactive media .
and this is really amazing , because you realize that the high technology that you &apos;ve encountered is that it &apos;s actually bringing you into the future , but in fact it &apos;s the future of us , at us , at our archatic roots .
now , what are the archaic models ?
i &apos;ve written four words and i &apos;d like to explain quickly .
on archaic cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve made in the pre-industrial times .
so , the archaic models , we have a principle of natural relationship to the virtuality .
and that sounds unusual in principle .
but i &apos;m going to go back again , and i &apos;m going to show you by trying to have a natural relationship to the virtuality .
the second thing is we &apos;ve been dealing with because of these archaic models are capable of talking very , very one-to-one , even though we use an coded language .
and the third area , which is why it &apos;s about itself .
we all know that the interactive media is done by definition nonlinear , because of course , involves the linearity of linearity , and of course , we know that we think we think is the linearity .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place for us information .
like this is now with the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
let me just to show you that .
how many doors have the house , in which they live ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but this is going to happen and happen right now .
they go around the spirit section through this house , in the educator , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
it &apos;s a virtualize reality , without computers .
alright , fantastic ?
and so we &apos;re going to give the media campus to describe the virtual reality in our v.r. lab , we can actually already have this whole time .
and this kind of this kind of momentum that corresponds to virtual reality , which have been necessary to the people in the pre-industrial times , because they hadn &apos;t yet .
they didn &apos;t have any books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photolitography .
they had no mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was playing .
in this mind was called knowledge and using this virtual images , the definition of imagination , it was passed to see knowledge .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in all of us that we can deal with virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is if i &apos;ll make a little trip trip .
yes , here .
the interesting thing about it is that this period of the human day media producer and medium itself was .
so , if you just think a bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll just talk to that again .
fundamental tool for information education has been since cartoons .
shaanne , priests , so-called knowledge guards , were convicted to maintain knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still dependent on stories .
the author of the abe book , jonathan god &apos;s all , that &apos;s why we &apos;re still doing a hundred hundred hours per year &apos;s prescription .
it means for a child that has spent all the long time to achieve the prototype of history , most of his life , with stories .
now we think our love of stories depends on this that we &apos;ve been sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , very far .
this goes on a lot to go into the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in an interactive media , as an amazing thing , is that we &apos;ve made it in our biological memory , thinking nonlinear .
i brought you an example with the north american tribe of nootka indian .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very insulted area , and you had to go around , and you have to navigate there , from island to island , to get food .
and they &apos;ve done that with so-called lead-land maps .
you may know that , even though you &apos;re interested in a little bit , from the australian species .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a leadadd maps , but they used these as well as electronanines and also refrigerated .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the currents and the topography of regions could be represented about songs .
meanwhile , the language of being understated by the undergeded .
that is , you navigate opinions about sound and about rhythm .
and this sound and this rhythm have demonstrated the geology , the topography of a region , which is , of course , that you could build the songs of defragmented animals , and so on the left up to the left , again , again , again , going back place .
why don &apos;t we sing more to get from the top of b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
so what &apos;s happened there ?
it &apos;s happening that is the pathics machine .
we &apos;ve moved to that before the bird age .
it &apos;s happening that the machine age is happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened to be the photo .
and that &apos;s what happened is that we have the responsibility for our memories , and the personal production of our individual memories have shifted external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , unfortunately , we have a piece of a brief glimpse of listening to god .
virtual intelligence is suddenly become foreign for us , and has nothing to do with the reality .
bruce brown , a familiar design researcher at the brighton university , is so far as long ago that these mass media , he says the book and the picture , the internet , etc , etc , etc , and on the internet today , so that this mass media has fossilized and our capacity are fossilized .
let &apos;s make a little bit of traffic .
from the bird age , for the machine age .
what has the impact on our thinking , and on our thinking , on our memory ?
then the mandatory consequences of pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re being done over the course of centuries and a lot more than the consequences of machine age .
so , instead of remember , we &apos;ve been standardized , we &apos;ve been standardized , far common , in myriamonal patterns of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
we &apos;re not generating more .
we have an abstract of an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the things we don &apos;t know anymore in pictures of images , but we &apos;re putting in our own language .
we used to think that things are linear .
and we have the linearity as the law , and there are times exceptions , like the non-linearity .
so what we &apos;ve left us is the point .
again , still , we &apos;re very , very strong at the heart of information education .
the question is , what is going on ?
we had the old age , we had the machine age , and we &apos;ll describe this so-called cyber age .
it sounds very repetitive , and it sounds very , very science , i know .
but these concepts of cyberage , which brings us to explore these options back to explore our capabilities again .
there it is about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearity , it &apos;s about getting .
so , i just explain a little bit .
there are technical concepts , like the augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then the concept of what brings us the virtual world is combined with the real world , which is what we think is the virtual universe , which is based on the virtual , natural , a normal , natural .
another example is called the virtual reality .
so of course , of course , in the context of my talk , of course , in the context of my talk , because we move into not existing , virtual worlds , virtual worlds , all the holocome of the holocbs .
and other examples are the ambities , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all this requires the ability , our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
so i &apos;ve been in conclusion , and i hope that video works , a very , very , very nice project brought along , this is a bachelism by michael &apos;s michael burk , anma cavating in crusticich , jor, guinness is a dump and jan-moritz .
and the two two are the ones here today .
maybe you can just get up for a minute , so that you can talk about the project to be able to talk to the project .
and this project i brought this project , for example , with this archaic , cognitive models .
the whole is a game , i have to tell you .
and what &apos;s common , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i tell computer play , you &apos;ve probably got very likely to figure out that any people are concerned with each other in front of them , or they play their hands in the hand from their hand .
in any case , they do it inside .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what happened is that i discover the outside world , so that i discover the real world again .
and this game is connecting the virtual world , so the data of the data space we produce , with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry that i have to cut so hard .
so you can explain that much better to explain , there &apos;s more more behind it .
and it &apos;s about what i discover a city by looking at which places were positive or negative .
and so i get to the city , i get a very different sight , a whole different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city , and get a whole different way of the virtual city from a very real city .
and now , we can see that now .
ah , what you can see , sorry is another explanation of what you &apos;re seeing right now .
of course , this virtual world , in our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of pocket lamp , we can see this virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to leave that , to summarize my talk , which in the sense , that the qualities and the qualities that we have acquired from the age of age , and we &apos;ve got a bit a little bit of a plesship in the machine age , and that &apos;s going beyond the virtual age of age , and that we don &apos;t think about that kind of complex , technological , new
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be able to be with you .
i am i already wondered whether this bag is there &apos;s a joint bag , it &apos;s going to talk about me .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m also going to unveil what &apos;s inside there .
but i just do it again a little bit more curious .
yes , kids are about nature are curious or should be curious , and you should be , designers .
i have a creator of the house , so , of course , i &apos;m involved with the issue of curiosity , and how is the interest on , and how it again , and why is we going to lose curiosity , and we need to get excited again , and so on and on and on and on and on and on and on and so on .
that &apos;s a whole series of things that you &apos;re dealing with is actually as expertise as designers .
when professors are curious , then they &apos;re going to be in such a research lab often .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a research semester on the issue natural interface design .
now you &apos;re going to be wondering , why do all the designers join themselves with so natural , archaic uramforms of communication , and so on and on and so on .
and so i &apos;m only one of these little devices , because things are always going to be more intuitive , more natural , use , use , use , use , and there &apos;s what we need to look at , which is actually for us human beings , which is use or intuitively .
and before the background , i have myself in the field of natural interface interface , so the next generation in the use of doing human computing in the relationship of the relationship of the human computer , with how our tools or how the computer changes or the computer of the computer from the computer , the computer &apos;s computer .
so i &apos;ve been looking at what , of course , or intuitively .
and maybe have to take a look at it again .
why is that happening ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , at the short term , we &apos;re moving at the third generation of population or society .
so , from modern modern society .
each society is shaped by primary media .
in the beginning , the tribal society began by the language .
that means that you found a common language talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , is going into the same cave or in other realms , and millions of cities or villages , in tribal society .
the primary medium was the language , was something very natural , something very life .
and also had to learn to learn , so no young child can talk about nature , but we learn it &apos;s supish and communication .
that &apos;s been resolved by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a big outcry at the time , because of course , as you started seeing the living language in the form of writing , which is what &apos;s fluid and alive , i &apos;m going to start to compose it in stone and manipulated .
so depending on like i &apos;m wearing , and when i &apos;m wearing in the el , of course , it &apos;s a very different coverage than when there is an alive .
but sukzhenged this script as a primary medium , got to finish .
and then the next generation that we actually live in today .
this is just taken through pressure and print writing with a guberg and others .
at the time , it was as an acront , where adel , clerus and others have said , are it actually insane when the people start reading , then afterwards they want to talk to , and of course , it completely done .
and now we get into the next generation , and exciting is that a generational shift is only every few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually really in this phenomenal in this phenomenal stage , that we &apos;ve been involved .
of course , of course , puzzling it , because we see the new media , social social media media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , which is the new thinking , which is the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the cragle meat and not beef anymore or other phenomena , i want to just take a little .
and all of these worlds just bang each other , new and old thinking .
what &apos;s exciting about it is , when you look at this , this new society , this computer society , including a lot of many principles and archaic thinking patterns from the tribal society .
it &apos;s not local level anymore , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that is ecology is a global science .
not if i think local environmental thinking and the neighbor is less organic , then the whole thing doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from the local village , in fact , has become a global village , of course , with the same principles , of course , intuitively , but total transparency .
and as you knew in the village , who &apos;s going to be with whom and when , today , this is about this connected of our self through these mobile devices at global level .
is it &apos;s that we know global crops and faster and more fragmented .
so , as it used to happen in the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve been looking forward to see , which means , &quot; well , what &apos;s , of course , of course , what we may have forgotten , which is , but instinders , but instinctive , so , what does the difference ?
because often , people get people , they can &apos;t use it , they can &apos;t use it .
so , you have to deal with what &apos;s mean , because it doesn &apos;t just change it , because it &apos;s different , it should be better .
and when , of course , a little bit of intuitively , and how do i take a mental framework of influence , and we can make things like that , that they have an application , so the same thing is intuitively , because they make it fun and easy to use .
you &apos;ve also done , also , during the university , with the theme of perception and the perception of perception .
and of course , that &apos;s what you start and looks like , and it says , okay , i just look at the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work if we look at sea ?
and what does , of course , of course , intuitively , and how does our channels of perception work and how does the cognitive process ?
because steve jobs said , you don &apos;t have the need to get it done .
so , really , you to see in detail , if i want to use something to use or intuitively , what does that mean in the core .
and what you see is that you have a one of our seven senses , which most of us are just thinking about five , now it &apos;s actually seven to be seven , there &apos;s certainly the next future , which comes to the next future nor the next , and it also is connected to the self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say alone , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot the word , but don &apos;t even know what it &apos;s going to do .
but i have to understand in the core , to understand where information is about information , when will explain from data information , and from information , so that i know , after making things like that , or natural , or , of course , of course , make things .
and of course , acting design on perception .
we see this , when i get things tick , then i can make it puzzling on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it sort of intuitively by showing things .
so a lot of natural , that &apos;s in a hurry , but i look directly right now where salt and pepper hits .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll think about the right thing , where is it inside .
and in the left , on the left , access me , and hopefully that no sugar is in the way that salt is present .
but also our perception of self , we &apos;re fooled .
for example , this perception in context .
and the right-hand circle looks larger than the little bit , even though it &apos;s not the case except , but they are equally equal to the same size , and yet our perceptions depending on where context we put in .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
it should be done .
there &apos;s a little bit of my glasses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle of circle is starting to be able to correlate to certain things .
and if i sit down a halval more , then we don &apos;t just see more than another unit , which is cycle , circle , and , but we see a unit , we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more circle of three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle , one .
it &apos;s called the rule of law , or even reference psychology , which is associated with us now in perception .
it &apos;s important , important way for the designers , the most times in the first semester , the great filies of laws .
gesture of legislation , slope of the continuity and so on .
well , a third , forget again .
but that &apos;s a very important thing in the world , if you want things to make intuitively so intuitively .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about sight .
it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting for interesting when you &apos;re involved with it .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes up , and now you think we &apos;re seeing the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see at the end of the back .
and because they typed up a presumption , in the front of the front , that you see something that you &apos;re seeing , sort of a big circle .
that means that we just appreciate what we see before we see it , and then bring it back to the back of our sehedevice to say , okay .
i put it in the cognitive retaliation , and you &apos;ve got a , you know what you want .
so , then that comes back again .
then it goes back , because it doesn &apos;t last the back in the front of the front , and it says , well , so , well , i &apos;m going to go back , surely , you know if you see what you &apos;re seeing what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually seen .
so a whole , very exciting process of the process , like certain things happen in what &apos;s going on for millilinear areas of these things .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
it &apos;s exactly the same thing is happening to happen .
now everybody &apos;s trying to try to see something .
i don &apos;t know who knows what .
anybody see a particular ?
a dalmacker , right .
and once i &apos;ve seen this , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a daltoman , you know this .
you &apos;ll never forget it more , because i &apos;ll show you where the bike is .
now you see the dalmatier .
and keep going now , look at him now .
so , i &apos;ve actually spotted them at all the time that you don &apos;t recognize patterns inside , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short term , you know , again , see this dog in this dog .
and this is the projection of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know it and now i &apos;m sketching at the front , which i see the daltolic .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , surprisingly , exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray is not actually not , but here in this rosanal crowd , it &apos;s happening .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , it &apos;s three seconds , until i think of the present for the present , i &apos;ll also stretch a very good list of bridges , and i &apos;m going to do it by three years of three seconds i &apos;m involved with three seconds .
it just has to process it as a present .
and then it moves into the past , and so i can stretch very elegant wait for example of the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s going to 20 milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period when you fall in love .
that means to be aware , if you know this now , look at who look like a long time , because i don &apos;t take a tag from what &apos;s going on .
and six milliseconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the length of most perceptions we have .
that &apos;s the first impression that happens in a rapidly &apos;s fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we sort of leverage our environment against our environment so we can also address that .
of course , designers are not only dealing with the issue of perceptions and neural entuses or cognitive ngonomia , but primarily involving the issue of human-object relationship .
so , as a human person is dealing with certain things .
there &apos;s a product of product that &apos;s available practical functions , which is the formal things , or physical aesthetic ones .
there &apos;s a visual functions where i know exactly where i need to do .
it also , there are symbolic functions , why do you have a little bit of stuff like that , where you don &apos;t have any kind of fit in money , although it &apos;s not so practical ?
so we &apos;re more on the imagery , which is , of course , we think , of course , as designers , of course .
back to my actual theme of natural interface , and the theme , which is , of course , is , is , omam .
useen means , as a result , how can i achieve a certain goal , or how can we do it in a certain way in a certain way , effectively effectively , efficiently , efficient and happy foundations .
that &apos;s the way to tell the norm .
how can i make something like this ?
can i use that directly , or i need the n manual or i need for training school .
and less of it , or use , is it .
that i &apos;m just doing that very different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better handable .
you have to understand that .
and if you look at the software we &apos;ve seen , you also understand why understand why nine percent of our modern software today is a little bit of intuitively , or not usable , which is , that &apos;s a dish , although it &apos;s already more intuitive than classical software .
it &apos;s surprisingly , intuitive practice hasn &apos;t only since a fundamental economic factor in terms of fundamental economic factor , crucial success , if i want to harness technology .
why ?
because it turns out of this new kind of fits , so the natural user juvenation is , for example , are five times faster in the average .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of classical socale , you need five hours , and you need to have an hour with this new type of energy .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you probably be able to go home four hours of course , but your employer , or somebody , is going to take a little bit like he &apos;s busy with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s naturally for us , of course , for us , is a certain amount of capacity to get things .
and then , if we went back to the software again , this is the first day interface that was very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next , which is now going to be done with the digital brain model , or mental model like the software o-gonists , because you &apos;ve had an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer .
so not more shorter , you know , or cryptic code , but it &apos;s a metaphor .
so that made the whole thing made a lot of forms , but it also goes much better .
the next generation of graphical high spaces has been working a lot more with behavior .
so i &apos;m very much more often the way i think of behavior as a creator .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that i &apos;m going to leave you that this is always more important for success for success , which is going to be a prescription .
and then , if i step into these natural user interfaces , where i use by voice , by language , by touch , by the gesture and not more per mouse , and i have to control things , then i &apos;m still quicker .
but that brings me to the point again , when do things get more intuitive ?
when you become more intuitive , and then i have to sit back to my little friend here , and look at what &apos;s going on a view of cognition , when is it &apos;s intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always something for us to be doing something , always , if i need to think about it .
so clearly , he doesn &apos;t like to think about it , but they just do it quite well .
the less i &apos;m thinking about this , the more intuitive thing is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means , if we look at the fact that we can transmit existing measures models from one on the one on something else , for example , the metaphor , i can do as a creator .
that means that i can put an intuitive human action model on a piece of software and make the software to use a lot of user .
if , of course , of course , what &apos;s the intuitive conclusion of people , and now i &apos;ve already heard .
this is called the artificial model .
it uses each of us and odars is an acronym , and we have an inillusionment , and you can choose , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
it &apos;s all of all the time , but it does it , but it makes power and it &apos;s sort of a generosity , or partly instinctively .
now the model is based on in the womb , and it &apos;s intercultural , so it works at young and old , and it &apos;s used by all the time without realizing that most time that most people knew that this model is present .
oafois , about 50 to 17 thousand times of us , so you &apos;ve noticed that it will be less ambitious than the day .
and i can take this mental model now , you can see , you can see , you know , you see , you know , you know , you can get rid of a behavioral system on a behavioral system .
and by this kind of transmission , sort of like the metaphor of the desktop buttons , but not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a nerve agent , a handable pattern .
and this is on a higher degree of the user kindness than the transmission of classical metaphor , which is the desktop seat .
and if i &apos;m wearing this , for example , for example , for example as overdefinition , selected as a choice , inform it up , it &apos;s going to be big at me , and i can look at it in the details of it , and it &apos;s going , i can throw it somewhere or to send someone .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to have a few examples .
and yet , everyone has paid cake .
exaggeration : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , right now , can zoom out and zoom in .
i &apos;ll get the whole track , can now get here on here and say , show me all the things with chocolate .
and in once a computer interface , which is a lot more intuitive and very much natural .
because , the things that i can get things like the bits , can be touch , and you get to me , is a lot more natural than if if over the thermal websites or other mechanisms to make it accessible .
imagination is more more nuanced , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close , a , and again , designers have to think differently to get to new solutions , and i thank you right now , and i thank you very heart for your attention .
so i want to give you to a certain aspect of curiosity .
the first thing that you &apos;re going to be as a child is , as a baby , is that you care about it , you have , right ? and depending on , if your parents may have allowed them to play more or less , the more or more or less , sort of course , your curiosity , of course , your curiosity , of course .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why everybody who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;ve been to me , this whole environmental debate , to me , is the world of world , four years of triangness , to implement quality .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
it &apos;s based on phosphorus .
give pee a opportunity .
every day you spend on one gram of phosphorus from about two grams , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you cannot store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only run in the global ocean , we could only .
if we didn &apos;t pick up phosphorus and make it out .
remarkably , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re thinking about something that would be a little bit more innate , but it &apos;s not really that .
because all talks about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus issue is far critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only been phosphorus for two years now , and already now , through the phosphorus forest , there &apos;s a lot more uranium in the world that &apos;s being used in the environment than all .
in the last 20 years alone , five-10,000 tons of dinosaurs have been distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
it makes leukemia at children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , take less car .
the environment , make less waste .
environment , the environment requires less energy .
but that is not protection .
that &apos;s like , if i would say , i would say , your child , it &apos;s only three times , instead of five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about the way to the bathing , then our whole earth is going to be used to be the old and later .
that &apos;s why the way to think about .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as a result .
in the soil , over six percent of the carbon .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and we lose 11 tons of 30 tons per hectare , and we &apos;re also retreating the square meter .
that means we lose five times more than five times more than new .
of course , we can see a problem with the waste of waste .
and everything is skydiving or content .
for example , there , for example , there &apos;s 20 percent of the waste of the waste of garbage now .
and because we &apos;re older , the wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s actually all in the foreground phase .
yes ?
one woman needs about the six half of the wind .
so , of course , of course , to reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is being balanced in china in china .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with those wind ?
here &apos;s the evidence that evidence that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is thrown out of the phosphorus down to the thickness of the solid components .
in humans , over the urine .
yes .
so that &apos;s not the men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is because it shows , right ?
traditionally , we think in environmental discussion , we &apos;re too many to the world .
and if you put the people when you start talking to people , if you say , it would be better , you &apos;re not warm there , then there , they become hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than the human population .
in israel you say , when you follow a human life , you make the earth .
here it tells you , the more you get around , the better .
yes .
the first question is , is we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of ants on earth , then the ants are about four times more than we do .
i could use termites , but in the united states , no one might be termites , as far as they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that ants are less more than us .
and because they physically work a lot harder than we and because it &apos;s only three to six months in their weight , it &apos;s about 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you can see how far we could do what we really wanted to do and could , and how sad is we &apos;re at the earth , you can see that , that for example , a program a program , then you want to be carbon-carbon , right ?
you can just be carbon-neutral if you &apos;re not existing , yes ?
the only thing .
have you ever seen a neutral tree ?
yes ?
one one ?
that means , our whole intelligence means that we want to be a flug as a tree , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon-neutral .
well , lucky , yes ?
there is no population of populations of trees .
there are still six billion of trees alone in the amazon .
have you heard about overpopulation problems of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be as a tree as a tree .
and where you see , even like the meters of demeter bioconsumption , agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolism back .
every year we lose about three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in roundspace .
and so we &apos;re too many .
by this .
that &apos;s why we feel guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no bioland , no philanthropic and , we don &apos;t have a promotion street , any of all of you , who allow all of us go back to our own species .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
it &apos;s too many of us .
it &apos;s safe to be very damaging , less damaging what oil uses .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , is the highest , not there , yes ?
lg : lemissions , yes ?
you can only have nullemissions if you &apos;re not there .
even if they went down now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can regain the nutrients .
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture , where we &apos;re going back the nutrients .
right now , we can get out of that kind of nutrients in agriculture .
for example , we &apos;re doing it in china , for example , where we take right to the distance .
in china , a proxy now is called honeybees again , for example , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always stupid to bring our nutrition back .
so , the whole western civilization-story is characterized by showing the city forever , but never given the farmers a little bit .
by doing the cities grow more , because the farmers went to the city , and cities had to continue to bring their nutrients .
and so all the western are now expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re imploded .
yes ?
in china was different .
you did compressed civilization from five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you expect them to stay as long as you go to the toilet .
because it &apos;s uncomfortable to go and increase the nutrients .
you had them invited them to eat for food , not for nutrient .
that means you can see the internet as you get to win nutrients .
it &apos;s nice thing is , if you do this , so , agriculture power , biogas , on a ccc60s , with five people in favelas , with a farmer , so a thousand-five hundred dollars , and a thousand dollars , and the dollar , five-dollar dollars and vegetables grow and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables grow .
and the great thing about this is that the monsoon rate in the favelas around over the 99 percent decrease over the favelas .
so we don &apos;t have to control people who are going to be very bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is natural tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed , by design , which is a farmer that can easily make them out .
this is , again , go back the gangsters .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve been built over 100 five years now in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been born .
you could just throw it in a liter of alpopol , and then it would be ruined over years .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people who are going to be very bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what , you write on , you know , in germany , at the best , is the best of the things , that is in the ones in france .
unfortunately , not in handstream , but maybe you can help the france a little bit .
because the dutch plant could be the best to win the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see this that phosphorus really is truly critical .
and we see that it &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;ve been deployed in holland now over three years .
the dutch government explains , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world will win the phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that are saving almost 17 percent of the phosphorus in the world .
there &apos;s an opec a bunch of orphes .
that &apos;s six countries in six percent of the oil supply oil .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace is through other energy carriers .
but you cannot replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s particularly questioning what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in fact , in the netherlands , of course , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the land is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine for example , for example , if your wife is sad , if you &apos;ve missed them , and you come with 50 roels .
entirely inefficient .
but it &apos;s true , yes ?
or take a lib pen .
a woman in germany eats about six comma three pounds during their lifetime .
around .
it &apos;s not a science that doesn &apos;t equate , because we don &apos;t know how much away kissing .
but if you see a lib , even at that lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s so effective , yes ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
that &apos;s why not resources efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn down to burn up a little bit better , and put it out and lose it into a waste plant that lose all the materials for roundcircuits , but first , first you ask questions , how do you add chunks ?
so think about mozart efficiently .
yes ?
if i invite them to dinner and say , well there &apos;s a tablet , a bag of open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
if you fall in love , somebody &apos;s efficiently ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not to be able to save , to reduce .
whole environmental discussion .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have environmental consciousness in the south .
no , that throw it is exactly the right , yes ?
in every point , where you take away , you know , yes , you create life .
but the wrong thing .
when you put the wrong stuff away , you have a waste problem .
so we think of north .
there &apos;s anybody &apos;s footprint .
when they run , yes , everybody &apos;s going to destroy the soil .
because the soil is going to die down , and the wind and the water hits the soil .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is going to be longer in the woods .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint that &apos;s going to be a wetarea .
not schoolmanagement .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how do you do with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , heart of spades , yes ?
that &apos;s the cutting down .
so don &apos;t save , avoid .
each waste is food .
and it &apos;s a lust if you see in italy like the people in the high bow , and you throw out of the car , and so on .
because you know , it &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s a form of refour behavior , yes ?
you can show you , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for example , for example , developed a protein packaging , which is fluid temperature .
you can kick them out where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re going everywhere .
and it includes seeds of rare plants , so that they &apos;re contributing through the throw of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so , there are two strands coming out .
not all about natural to be done .
a television or a washing machine , which is just using you who don &apos;t use them .
only the things that are veiling , like a shoe , like the brake , like the brake , like the car belt , they need to be like they &apos;re in biological systems .
the things that are used just being used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , he said , yes ?
it &apos;s a direct ad , not for a company &apos;s company , but for this company , they &apos;re going to help them make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things that matters .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to eat and say , that &apos;s free , then you don &apos;t help it at all .
no , we recognize what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all about what &apos;s inside is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the castable start off on the footprints and go the rubber into biological circles , yes ?
all of it is compositional .
and if we do , of course , we need to be able to use ourselves for nike , for nike , for hennisy and all the textile industry .
and this is half of all of all the waterproblems around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
so help you help , ask for the people .
hey , puma , are you serious ?
because they &apos;ve moved twice the foreface right now .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really stay at me .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been presented .
this .
we can do things like this now , when they &apos;re going to pick up , if they &apos;re going to get broken , they can be in biological sites .
technical roundsites are the same .
there &apos;s one for a direct renamcy system .
this is the first green backpack , in fact , which is done to go back into the cycle .
so , you know , in every store , you can get the things back .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the windmill ?
when it &apos;s the waste right now .
it &apos;s everywhere , almost .
in the countries that people get to money .
on the end of depoper , but it &apos;s also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water memory , the ones that they can go back to the price of cells , then they can plant a baby in israel , in tunisia 100 fifty trees of them .
yes ?
if you , if you take these darley , they crelze , vasecer , and take the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s carbon-positive for the whole life , from beginning .
so , we &apos;re not going to need carbon neutral , we can be climate .
it &apos;s sort of like a fly operation .
yes , it was .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can also re-invent everything else .
i started an institute .
there are a lot of people working there work , and you can all engage .
there is extra prome , crad-to-bradpost , where everybody can join .
so no more saving , encouragement , not reduce , no school management , but intelligent waste .
do you think of that curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreting .
music as a language .
so in the way , in the description of my talk , i wrote that i &apos;m interpreting as a translator , so in english wortsinn , understand .
the informed music is the written response to the written music .
that , as a translator , you &apos;re not just expressing the text for the text in a different language , but also the deeper point of words and woresuslibias has to understand a sense of the way to do an meaningful translation , knows it .
in fact , in the german in english , to translate in the english , it can be more likely to know if you go to diet or at love .
but critically , it &apos;s foreign , but we have the musicians dealing with our music language .
as an identity of a musical piece , i first have the written notes .
you know , in fact , the theme is that the composer is written in the notes exactly what he was thinking about .
in reality , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
these grades are about the same or unaccurate , like a resilient , seemingly seemingly magical , sign of a landscape .
because in this communal landscape description , the scoth of flowers is not to smell , the degree of the green is just to fool , the teapot of the wind not to feel .
that means , the role of the interpreters needs to be the fake description of the musical language in one other , which is goble , concrete , non-verbal music language .
today , i want to leave you what i &apos;m going to translate in love with musical music , so interpretations , even in a domain language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to take it all the way to do this in german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be really relevant to me with translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the lyrics have the role of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not enough to learn just to read the notes , and to press the keys on the piano , or the right place on a violin .
that would be just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
you can see the answer that the letters can see when you can do the language .
so , for the educational process of music , playing music language requires at least as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also more comfortable , whether you learn how to learn for the hfuses , or you can also get active , to be able to the musical mother language .
the work of interpreters begins like the director of a theater .
so after you &apos;ve chosen to play one piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re talking about what &apos;s going on to the emergence of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of the literature .
you read in the letters , you know , strip notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from themselves .
you study the works that he had presented before and afterwards .
you start to compare .
the motor reasons to write it .
how and what did he entore ?
how were its living places that were the society and politics ?
this is all about me .
you think in this time by looking at contemporary pictures or reading .
however , over time , you have a role of the interpretations around the composers that you &apos;re playing , and it will always easier to think about it and feel in it .
the composer is increasingly for the friend you live together .
to write , writing the play is becoming more and more to my personal cause to play it .
now , the notes are different than a bricking observer of the composer , but only a framework , i now turn this framework to make sense of meaning and meaning it .
so i &apos;m going to tell my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i want to play what these sound might have to mean .
now for me and for the composers , and what they might do now for him today .
every sound , every speaker gets a sense of sense because i feel it because i feel it in my own personal way .
it has to be consistent for me , and i can &apos;t convince my audience to realize that this is my cause .
it &apos;s still a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve learned so long in advance , to experience how long .
as you first experienced a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , to work , i still make the same piece of the same time .
i &apos;ve become a day , over again , shifting seasons , my pulse goes down at night than the morning , in a concert hall will take more longer that the sound comes back than home .
i &apos;ll i feel true , consciously or unconsciously .
all of this impacts me and all of it affected my experience of composition .
it &apos;s wonderful is when i &apos;m standing with a ducky mate on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
so the same thing happens in a good , deliberate dialogue .
you get a new idea in it and you &apos;ll experience this answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we don &apos;t have so procured and what you can &apos;t get samples like that .
it &apos;s a great thing for fun to make music in this way , and then when audiences have experienced the music is communicating alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like that in that moment .
i can &apos;t play today like in 20 years today .
there i am going to have more life experience today , and that &apos;s why my baseline of music sounds like much more color , emotions and sentiments .
sure , i &apos;m sure , i &apos;m going to wipe out some color pots but get new .
there &apos;s got a very simple example .
it was on a piano assessment for music students at my beloved old teachers , professor jbegen , a well-known illutee , concert tpianist and late school professor of the music school in kenya .
sadly , i was a lot too young , so that he had been emtened when i finally started studying .
but i was fortunate enough to meet him very early for three years , and so i was already at my school days .
i was 17 at the time , when i took up on one of his courses again , and i played the last one of the four balshop of chopin , you know , the last .
he asked me what the introduction of these balils were for me .
it &apos;s such a trained part .
and in my adolescence , i said , &quot; expectation . &quot;
and there was he chep , and he said , so ?
that must be the difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he was about six .
well , at 7 , you have old dreams , but no major memories .
so i play today playing this piece every few years , and it &apos;s always changed for me , although not only has a single note .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because i &apos;ll read something new .
an example of it , a very different area , monet has painted the seerotic x .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in many parts of day , different light .
he translated the seirly shifting apart , so as he saw it , as they did it in this moment .
his personal impressions of the fyx .
the x-rocket interpretation of one piece is the same .
and i also am older than chopin with two-and-a-half years when he wrote this piece .
he has been just nine years old .
and i think it &apos;s important to look back in the notes , even if i can memorize them .
to keep maintaining esks right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially when he died has .
well , how do you start talking about talking about music ?
i &apos;ve said you know , it takes about the spoken language for this .
a lot of course is that you learn only to read the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning about reading , before you &apos;re just talking about a word .
you learn to find the sounds on the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right as it moves into the notes , then they come out of sound that sound like music .
when that error gets out of error , the students gets the next hard piece .
it &apos;s not talking about interpretation in the early school .
all right , then is a presto , which is a fast piece .
poto , slow .
according to the light , f and b , etc .
most of you know .
but even when you turn this information , it still stays slightly technical .
yet , it &apos;s not always interpretation .
i wonder myself .
and i wonder that there &apos;s often a very basic difference .
because , to make music on the instrument , to make their own musical care and feel already before .
and that &apos;s singing .
a child who doesn &apos;t have learned to chant because they don &apos;t have parents &apos; parents will not do it .
it &apos;s like talking about speech .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , then , over a more way , to bring up an instrument .
people who have never unify have never felt immediately with their own bodies , as it is to form a tone .
and a statement with its own breath .
that &apos;s the music is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to chant singing our hands and feet to dance .
so the hamtia in the piano &apos;s pursuit of my fingers .
the tune comes from in terms of freedom and the rhythm from the dance .
the continental berilation nowadays with music is not profitable there .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself feel more authority if it gets boring .
not need to whistle , hunting or singing .
every single music is going out when you get the outside of the outside .
sure there are safe , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i don &apos;t like it ?
the question i know , can you not sing , is because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to chant .
either , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out if you can &apos;t yet , or to learn how to use these little muscles that use the vocal chores the right .
you can actually train this .
or c , because you have to admit that they &apos;re untailable .
i ask , how do i think about competent ?
have you ever gotten a second -- or third opinion , as you say it well ?
or d , you don &apos;t like a music , and therefore you want to have a nix to do it .
so what i would probably regret is because music is a beautiful , democratized thing .
but maybe you can also balance them yet .
well , so you see , none of all cases don &apos;t have a point candidate .
but don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so i say , but surely you can tell you whether or not it .
because i don &apos;t think somebody , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m taste is because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t give up for food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t have to admit in classical music because they don &apos;t play instrument .
listen consciously and tell you whether it tastes you or not .
whether the music is too pepper or too sweet .
tell that what you &apos;re feeling .
while time , you get stressed , and you want to have a little bit more playful or taste even nice differences .
so why am i asking for my audience , that it &apos;s also contributing to play ?
because the music is a language , and language is about communicating .
a piece of art that you never look at is not to make power .
the food that has been cooking from a chef or a chef , is not going to be eaten , and not only come up or replicate or for recipes .
so listen , please , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice piece of noise .
if in a neighborhood where adults are doing music , or at least active music , gets active , becomes a child , it &apos;s a very easy for a musical teacher , wondering , which color does the color ?
can you just play it in blue ?
and the child &apos;s playing , after a memorial , instead of a red one , is now a blue flower .
and this sounds quite different than before .
this was then the first beginning of a personal musical expression .
so the first step to your interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re going to play a piece today , which was done in front of a hundred , two-hundred years ago ?
now the instruments have continued to evolve .
there was a time creek in time when there &apos;s no keyboard .
it wasn &apos;t yet invented yet .
and i think that bach would have been thrilled if he had a reasonable possibility of the technology of modern prosthetic .
i can also have the idea of the sound that the stream had had to sound on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be cemjbalo .
also , from beethoven , you know that it had heard of something that he had ever heard of .
today , modern orchestras is able to play all of the things that an orchestra has turned down as unposible before .
so the composers rely on us are reinventing the songs again .
so they &apos;re going to hear what they &apos;ve seen in the spirit .
and also , what you think in the spirit today .
or this is what i &apos;m thinking about today is because what they might be thinking about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
are you even done ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend , which is a passerati .
and then i come , with my little v pianist , and i get it wrong , this feeling came up .
i &apos;ll shoot something through my head .
i say , triple , what are you going to have a big car ?
it &apos;s got half of its value for the first year .
and at all , you work a lot less than me .
why do i need to afford this little car ?
and then immediately , it falls , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , this is the awkward feeling path .
our organism has invented a great way to get these unpleasant feelings like envy .
they can try it with words like rache or profit-based .
i &apos;d like to explain to you with this mechanism today or something very quickly , which is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from a lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie as you may have heard , if people say , no one has a wall .
and then wipe down the door so that he hits them .
one such a lie , you see the liars not believe what he says .
it suggests that it has to realize is that it has different in the sense .
he doesn &apos;t deceive it and not herself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is to do so that you fake themselves .
you need this lie to get a life lie to maintain a self-delusion .
they can put them less easily , yes , sign or down .
you need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter , the guy &apos;s seat , is an wife .
the woman then did it , the portrait wouldn &apos;t even see her .
picasso says , &quot; you just wait .
they &apos;re always going to become more similar .
at this point , if you &apos;re laughing , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something , what artists can tell us .
because artist has a broken relationship to lie .
and the artist gives you something with you , and particularly this lady , which you can &apos;t see when they just look only into the mirror .
and the artist is part of something like this kind of portrait that you &apos;re only going to be familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this artwork .
and then this sort of uncomfortable feeling , it doesn &apos;t seem to be similar to them , and it &apos;s always going to get more .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lives .
and not only in art , including sms , in the mythology , it comes back in stories .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked into the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the whole country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beauty .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you know , like a lot of hostility from this true , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , out of this true conclusion .
but we should just see ourselves that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a good amount of beauty .
this is necessary to bring that to what we understand under .
we need this point at this point of lie that holds us with deception without not alive .
we don &apos;t just have art in terms of the writers , but in science , we have such great lies in science .
and there is this story of the woman &apos;s brachole of worchester .
she heard about the book of charles darwin , who &apos;s part of the species and the reviving of people .
that human beings were supposed to be out of the monkeys and , yes , there was at least a common ancestor between humans .
and then she ran , she ran to her man and said that &apos;s probably not true what charles was writing .
man should have to come from the monkeys or have a common ancestor .
no , no , that won &apos;t .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to stop the people to understand .
why do we need to prevent people make knowledge of something that &apos;s true if it &apos;s true ?
because without that we can &apos;t live without this live lie .
because we &apos;re this self-deception , this sense of being , it &apos;s great from the highest creature , not by one of those things that exists from such a organism that kind of an organism that exists , a rock resemblance and other things that matter .
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
we need to stop that people get knowledge of things , especially when they are true .
so what you can see how slowly this mechanism dissolves and how the implications look at it , which it leaves to something else , than on this magnificent picture of ourselves , i want to bring you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told her .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her student .
one autistic student .
and she likes to be particularly though , because he has a propenation of tielessness .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , &quot; well , i am on fire . &quot;
and because i am on fire department , i &apos;m interested in paroic technology .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re a flood of that point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral mood manufacturing , we should use it , we should be trying to replace it .
so , take a little bit and learn the sentence .
even though i &apos;m fire department , i &apos;m interested in paroic technology .
you feel that feel the truth behind the survey .
that &apos;s a little bub , which is not interested in fire .
it &apos;s the interest for fire .
but there &apos;s no way we can look at where you learn how to make fire .
there are only second best is the fire brigades .
that &apos;s where it .
and this is all of your teacher doesn &apos;t say that you like to put up in a time somewhere , and i &apos;m glad to be upside down .
no , it &apos;s it , it just looks a lot better than we show that we &apos;re in charge , to remove the risks that make others only do when they put fire .
so here you have these little mechanism .
so these evidence of that , in the halls of the book already knew that it &apos;s related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t tell that loud .
here you have a hint between the unconscious and conscious , which jumps right away without having something about it , and the things you know is that you might look very different , so designed that you can sound much better for you and others .
so , just like these words that we &apos;re going to use in the language of the politically centric speech .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know , we know , when we talk about it , social is extremely sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present those things in a society that should work .
now , i &apos;d like to realize what we found in my institute .
now , what logic of this deception , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality that we actually actually know in unconscious knowledge is that it &apos;s valid to spread .
i want to present to you , maybe in three minutes .
the first example of what many of you are familiar with , and some of you appreciate them don &apos;t need very few altogether .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is something more intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something which is not silent , materially , materially .
and if you have people who have a reasonable belief that you own up with a soul , or you can also say , the belief that you have a soul to life , that it &apos;s about the soul like something like , not like a spiritual frame about them , not like a spiritual and a spiritual , in terms on the heart of course , like a little bit , and the blood , missible ,
and from this soul , you think that it &apos;s kind of like this in this cloud-shaped nature , in this bunker , anima is in latin , the bass , in latin , the air , is present .
and if that wind line was added over people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit , with nature , with nature , who can only live , yes .
and then it can run away .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul does .
so she &apos;s supposed to get from the outside of people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that is necessary for our lives .
and if you have that epiphany of eyes , then you understand the logic that we experience that happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now you can use a three-sentence .
thirty : you know from school .
this is this is a three-sentence here that defines a logic .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk .
here &apos;s here , you need something logic , but the willingness to lie .
and , to lie that you can use these logic just false .
in this three-year-old comes in three sentences .
the first sentence , the first sentence , cla&apos;t have a soul .
so the second sentence is , when clones is , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
there &apos;s a third sentence .
so i picked it in particular .
third one third of the third sentence , which comes across with people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead and cannot claim anything .
and here &apos;s a feel .
here comes this is this logic in this , yes , in this prosthetic talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re very conscious .
i can therefore can tell everything .
the analytics don &apos;t talk about the reality .
i can say that kanzian is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the canadian boy is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , then the canzni is not a man .
the analytics don &apos;t tell you about what &apos;s true .
i can tell everything .
it &apos;s an important , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when it says clicks , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logical right .
and now our fake consciousness is shining immediately , so you can do something .
it &apos;s based on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence would have proven and predicted .
because we have to prove to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with these logic , it just uses that two sentences are logical , and it depends on a third thing that looks like it would have to do with it , so that we can save our lives lie .
so , we pretend it as if it &apos;s not impossible without having a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we &apos;re going to continue these things to different examples .
in the present , we have a whole modern example , filling up the day newspaper .
you have to think about , again , another philosophical theme , you &apos;ve got to think of your philosophy from philosophy .
this is to do that to do that we go back into the 42 century .
there were there , there that was named johannes buridanus , and after that &apos;s the buridanc esel .
the buridane esel is an esel that &apos;s made from pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
that &apos;s a natural thing .
and if you place the exact end of the middle between two or two degrees of these harbor harbor , frogs .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to do you first .
it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how natural things are demonstrated .
there &apos;s forces , with opposite profigurations of each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just when you take another example , so if you get a lot of times bigger , it doesn &apos;t take a lot of reason , and none of it takes .
he &apos;s automated at the right idea .
so when you know , in nature , you &apos;re kind of forced to be somewhat driven , and so that &apos;s what the bigger pile you put up right now , then you &apos;ve got a little bit of feeling that it needs to be a free will .
and if we have we already have the primary ones here in france , then i remember the max institute for brain research .
there is there an scholars , there &apos;s a scholars called the wolf , and you sometimes say , there , there are no careless sex .
now , we can form the second sentence again , and you can tell you , if the wolf is , it &apos;s not welcome to be free .
and these are completely logical and accurate sentences .
and so , what we can read is almost daily in the day newspaper , they find them in this third sentence .
it looks something like that , who don &apos;t have to be free , can &apos;t be pulled for their actions and the claims of the responsibility , and so that &apos;s unsustainable .
so here you have again again .
in fact , one thing had to show out whether there &apos;s something like welcome to sleep .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as well as if the first sentence was wrong with granted you have to consider the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do , if you want to make anything yourselves , if you want to test , and especially when you want to make people happy , to practice that fortune to lie .
so , for example , practice that , if you look at a person that you can then say , there &apos;s no previous sergeant .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the previous deadline , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t allowed you to call it , that would be a little bit politically incorrect again .
tell you , there &apos;s no previous sergeant .
so , you &apos;ll see , for example , to know the previous sergeant , you know , that you don &apos;t know .
and they have a problem .
because as you know , while they &apos;re busy trying to realize that they cannot prove that there &apos;s no previous sergeant , the guy is happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has led them to a ride that he doesn &apos;t hang on .
because in fact , in the point is not interested in case .
it &apos;s just interested in itself that prevents itself from the need to prove that there are preceded to the need .
so , in the way , in the context of the evidence , you experience the brilliance of lie .
and if you once have a way to feel this three-sentence at other people , you do it because you &apos;re going to be happy happy if you remember it in your self-lie .
i thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to tell you lilly , if i &apos;ll say it .
she &apos;s one of the campaign in this magnificent event , and asked me if i wanted to take a talk here and give my idea out .
i have to say , honestly , you &apos;ve got it in my mind , so it was hard to talk about my idea .
and maybe i may imagine my island project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , of course , the sum is very , very many different ideas .
i &apos;m probably listening , both of the great girls still , i &apos;m probably listening to the generation , for this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve begun to study a nine-hundred nine-nine-year-old district in karlsquiet , tech college , technological school , today , i think , gadgets .
and i went to the middle of the eighteenth years after berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t leave that in karls.
there was the nuclear research plant in this room .
they were all the ph.d. in the late days , including the jewish .
this is where we call us project .
because a good engineer either made a great car or nuclear power plants .
but the thing that did , like , the n solar pendel , which was sort of a hundred watts out of the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering tool .
i &apos;m grateful to the prime minister , grateful that he made the word again again , because after the mouth , you couldn &apos;t use the word worse because everything on the left was bad .
however , it wasn &apos;t that in the alb70s .
and it was so much of it was self-sufficiic businesses , and one of them was sitting there in crusth , where you suspected the evil .
the terrorist mush place , but it was called gectronics , and it made wind , and sun energy , and then i started in the middle of the eighth axis .
and yes , a lot of what i said today was , i feel very , because many , many beautiful expressions i &apos;ve lived through .
i worked on 11 years , i &apos;ve been working for the collective , which was a grassroots society .
we were 20 people .
if one thing , if you &apos;ve said no , the matriopriner , i &apos;ve been very hard to screw up for ten years , i &apos;m not really bothered by whether i &apos;ve got to have a lot of 10 years , and all the colleagues of my father always chatted to talk about me , you know , you &apos;d sneak up with your kid the window out of your father .
it &apos;s all about flails .
and that was really , really , really , very bitter , and then you get into this point , and it showed that picture , where i asked myself , after 10 years , a thousand star mark , that was at the time back at the collective of course whether that really should be the great .
and i went out to six times to six nights , and then we got together with friends , i became the founder of the company , and then in the spoff the spout of the largest nucleus of one of the largest cell manufacturer in the world .
now , a great story , but also , of course , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing company , and we then have two thousand thousand , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going back to the next to go back and our next theme of the future is , again , again , again , that &apos;s right again , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s not what &apos;s going
and i brought a project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
and the title of the presentation was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just start thinking about a fairly simplistic history story , where one might make a sense of memory now .
on this island , this is the island graciosa on the azgers .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s a four-and-a-half thousand people .
they have been about five percent of them today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
that &apos;s just incredibly technological .
if you build more wind and more , the system starts to fail .
i also , i always tell the politicians when they &apos;re going into berlin-adin our facility .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
well , we have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem yet .
but not , in europe , we have seven percent europe , and our network is physically the european one .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , measuring it , number two , a half 2006 , have the first store along the island , and it just did it .
as big as big be a battery , so that one island in 20 , four , four , five , maybe even 17 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll just keep a slide again .
the conventional system looks like everywhere around the world .
by the way , a hundred gigawatt watts of electrical electrical power are built on the world .
that &apos;s because of a hundred nuclear power power performance , because it &apos;s all over everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world , it &apos;s being deleted with diesel , because you don &apos;t need to use it .
so this is quick .
you put it up here .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
three of the things going on , two will always be ready and waited .
yes , so that &apos;s the weight down there .
we also got very accurate data .
and the wind plant or the solar plant , or whatever it is also , is in the rule , is in the rule , is a brick system like a system like a system , in a system , can make only in small quantities .
we were going to just say it , okay .
the el gets up to the wind and the wind , controlling the load so that they can take the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance right now , then you have to turn this mouse off .
so , right now , in the moment , you &apos;ve got to worry about the energy in terms of generating the web .
so , of course that in any way they &apos;re managed to .
that &apos;s not done in the world yet .
there &apos;s a little bit in the small scale , so you can use your shaves on the car over a little bit of judges .
people always ask me , what are the research of you , right ?
this is already happening .
but if you want to combine several of these complexities together and to build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to nine-seven percent renewable renewable , and then there is still this rest of the last decade , 20 percent renewable , which is going to become very , very expensive doesn &apos;t work , and not work with batteries .
that &apos;s going to be a more energetic , you know , hydrogen , methane , power , power , power , you know , it will be familiar .
they also have a longer have to go to a seasonal store and winter summer and no night .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , stinky electric chemical battery .
how far , how far do you get at all ?
and then a whole bunch of simulation being done .
and the wind and the sun and the burden burst and came to the result , a very exciting result that you need to have over the conventional system of about 50 years , which is required to about 50 cents per pound hour , about at about 50 cents per kilowatt-hour .
that was the first story of calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , like the virus system , if the net price price is going up five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the senior fishing .
what would be done ?
have been looking at investors with profit , i looked at a new drilling .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society .
and here again , this shows .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
and that our system , our system has a leaf , is that we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with this daisy , and not waste a price on the other things .
and the power supply , which is what the electrification utility companies on the island , it meant that we find great .
and also want to support support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can do the technological problem .
and so we decided to build in berlin in berlin , where we can put electricity in the order of magnitude at scale in order to form one very closely .
so , we &apos;ve been looking for finding the biggest battery of the world .
here she is .
it comes from natural from asia , in the event from japan .
and funny interestingly , in the &apos; 70s , she &apos;s at the &apos; 70s at the bbc crew , and now abb was developed , and then he was licensed to the japanese .
and you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of watts , and can bring it six hours long for six hours , and this is the battery that we &apos;ve got to have a little bit of simulation digitization .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these genetic ones in the same size , where it says in the hall , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this network , so it looks like this , in the front of the front of the big battery is the big battery , here is the big battery , and here is the whole thing that we simulate the net .
over here , we simulate all the transcendent manual system , the miles physics of cables to put the vibrational behavior in the net .
and here you see the whole thing .
we can also turn to two-thirds of a hundred kilowatt photovoltaics on the net .
here we see again here , and again , this one , again , again , a couple of times .
and what we &apos;ve done since two-thousand-nine was finished , until two thousands of 12 , all of which is between the single system of electronics to software , we did .
so we &apos;re not batting makers , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject of battery and the theme of the network and everything in between .
you need to communicate with , of course , to the battery , you have to communicate into the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about the subject is that , on this island , we &apos;re basically going to be able to do everything about problems that we &apos;re going to get , if we want to increase our advantage of renewables .
so , this whole discussion that &apos;s going to happen right now is , right now , is moving back to the moment , energy turn , like , for example , for example , we &apos;ve got about five to 30 percent of intimately , so we have 30 percent of the wind , and the wind .
and then light pattern is smart grid .
so , sandc , a huge topic everywhere .
we can we now start to integrate electrical mobility on the island , because you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at seven percent renewable , you &apos;re not going to do it without memory .
you can do with n grid , you can do it by building nets , yes , you should be able to do it in any case , but you &apos;re never going to dispense your memory altogether .
and that &apos;s a little bit the message .
so many people come , and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn onto this el , you don &apos;t have any of these roticular mass that causes certain inertia in the network .
and our european processing system is basically just a noisy mass of large power plants , where the wave is made everywhere around europe .
we look into this web , we see 50 hertz , and if there &apos;s nine dimensions of comma nine hertz , we &apos;re starting to make a little bit again , again , a little bit of merh dam , then we &apos;ll get up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that is incredibly haustible .
if you tear it down somewhere , it takes a while .
the right now cures reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and at the time , you can react to other people .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , these roeline mass , then you can replace that with the power of power and electrochemicals .
and we can actually switch with this great battery two milliseconds once .
well , you know , there are enormous things there are .
and the message is now , we have to dispense onto these roses if we sort of get 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach at all .
then we need to break off our must-run capacity .
must-run is just called the power plant running around the frequency .
yes , it &apos;s a huge debate right now in the moment , from coal fuel plants , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gastorm binders , because that &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can break the capacity , the must-run rate , using electrochemical memory into the network .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and to that &apos;s what people would come and look at our trial , sort of like our island test .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take a little bit of the future there .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were like the discussion i had over the last 30 years , for the issue of photovoltaics .
don &apos;t go , it &apos;s low-meaning , child play stuff , we expect , don &apos;t matter .
we &apos;ve got 30 gigagigawatts of hydrogen in germany .
this is forething .
and i &apos;ll i leave that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of electrochemical store around the world .
it just , it will come .
it &apos;s where it comes to a whole bunch of contradictions and curve .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve actually experienced in the last two years , that the scientists are asking themselves .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million programs now , we &apos;ve now got to the one-10,000 megawatt-dollar battery now to the german net .
this will happen in april next to april .
so , from that point , you can see that there &apos;s a change there , and only from that point of defense to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable renewable , then that &apos;s like an autarp system .
so far , in arguments , this sort of thing is trying to do this kind of course , the tratark , they have a very small net , which has been to do with our processed and nothing .
the question is , just simply , if you &apos;re completely independent of any of these fossil fuels or ancient energy , there &apos;s going to be drilled somewhere in the world , and then they &apos;re a island .
then you only use what the sun and wind is there , where you live .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a fulfunctional energy supply , and i also admire the cradapple to cradle , that they said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s in consuring , and the talk of m.1 is about m.a , that you &apos;ll be able to use a collective and use solar energy here a little bit .
and so , i just want to encourage you to encourage you , in the sense that you can feel a little bit crazy , and also to have a vision .
and you really have to stick really hard , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
now , as steve lopez , columnman , the los angeles times he went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathetic , rau , homeless , who was playing on a ghost , who had two saders .
many of you will know the story , because there was a book about this , again , a book that was confused by robert 4 ney junior by steve parapez and jamie mrx as nathaniel abxia , who launched the double arber , and whose poster &apos;s career was finished until his paranents .
nathaniel left up , nathaniel left juilliard , suffered an instrument breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless on the streets of scid row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend to look at reading or to look at the film , so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection between these two men , but also how the music helped this connection , and how it was the instrument that allows this word game , to get photos of the decision from the street .
i met mr. ayers in the years of 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney line hall .
he just heard a talk about the name of beethoven &apos;s first day and fourthony , came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking to a very thorough and co-rescue sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers are never going to get into the baseball part of the first end of the first line on the first sentence in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came up with music for the subject , and a few days later , i got an email that was that disney was interested in favor of teaching .
i need to mention , again , nathaniel did a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electroshocks and copiism and handschism and hand-charged , a trauma that has been tracking his entire life .
as a consequence , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases now , and they are so bad , and it disappears around in the streets of scid row , all the horror and the folder of his mind .
and in fact , a lovely stage was nathaniel when we began with our first curriculum at walt disney line hall , and he had lost this insane flute in his eyes .
he was talking about invisible damons and smoke and things like anybody wanted to poison him in their sleep .
and i was afraid , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could break him into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , when i started to talk about clay and aros and chief and other exciting forms of the didaic arts .
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven violin propaganda .
and as i played , in my head , i realized that in nathanels , a complete difference was a complete change .
it was like though , underneath the impact of an invisible medical nei , a chemical reaction that was catalyzing my game .
nathanik manic anger turned in understanding in a quiet curiosity and the courage .
and like a miracle , he took his spirit and started to play for hearing some clips of violintv , and then asked me to play them : menhusson , teykoski , siverlium .
so we started talking about music , starting by bach about beethoven , brams , brubling , and all the other bs , from bark k to toa-pekka salons .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a forum &apos;s law knowledge about music , but also connected her personal personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i could only know about my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
by playing music , and talking about music , was from this paranoids , confused man who moved to the streets of los angeles , a loving , well-educated , educated , in juilliard , in juilliard , an educational musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for the scenes for nathaniel , music is physical health .
because music allows him to really change its thoughts and delusions with help their imagination and creativity into something real true .
and he went up with his agonizing condition .
i understood that that &apos;s the nature of art .
this is that &apos;s why we make music : so that we can do something that is in all of us , deep inside ourselves , through our artistic lens , through our artistic lens , through our creative lens , can actually forms .
and the reality of that kind of expression is all done all of us , and moves , inspired and united .
what nathaniel anchor was going on , he took him back into a community of friends .
the power force for music brought him back into a family of musicians who recognized him who knew his talent and roller .
and i &apos;m always going to get nathaniel music again , whether whether in the walt disney line , or in scid row , he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
oh bruno gizhabi : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;m untrained to stolen the celliist .
i hope you forgive me .
so i cleaned up a fish in my life .
i just loved two .
so the first one , which was more like a passionate agent .
it was a beautiful fish , well-touched , good consistent , intricate , the best seller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was born in aquakules after the highest standards of sustainability .
so , you could feel like to sell him .
i had an relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the head of the company called the company asked whether i could pay for a event about the sustainability of the farm .
of course , i said .
here was a company trying to solve what had become the unimaginable problem for our chefs : how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we have fished the oceans as we beat forests .
it &apos;s hard to overgrade the destruction .
ninety percent of the great fish we love , the tuna , the cures , the cures , the severe , severe fish , they &apos;re broken together .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , think bad &quot; aakullocks , fisformation , a part of our future . &quot;
a lot of it : well , fishing lanes around the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , you take tuna , you take a big deal .
he has taken a bundle from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are required for a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
taste is not taste very well .
so here was finally a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to encourage them .
the day before the event , i called the head of public relations for the company .
let &apos;s call .
don &apos;t , &quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far outside in the sea that you don &apos;t polluted the environment . &quot;
that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we basically are a whole world .
this feed two and a half and a half , it said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
two , two , one , great .
&quot; a half one thing : what do you feed ?
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and at that evening , i was in bed and thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , quickly before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t we do sustainable proteins for example ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask .
so , with a telephone with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a stable answer , until i finally hired with the propulsion biologist .
let &apos;s call him .
don &apos;t i say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins for example ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish , and then he said hello chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken clars . &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , grains , skin , bone flars , dry and growing together . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , how much percent are expensive food is chicken ? &quot;
you might see two percent in response .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable to have chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved my fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-articulate and good person .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i actually love to love this fish because , i swear to god , the fish that &apos;s been swallowed after that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you learn to know your fish , you love the fish .
i was eating him in a restaurant in southern spain .
a few friends friend had been talking about for a long time of this fish .
she &apos;s got us in a way .
he came up on the table with a bright , almost wet white color paint .
the chef had to cook it .
hold twice .
it was surprisingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so good after he was cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he hasn &apos;t cooked the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at the way you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at pesa la palma .
this is a fish filled in the southwest of western england .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river gustervivir .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the head of argentiniders .
they were running meat cattle on the , which was basically wetlands .
they were doing that by using the land of the land .
they built this complicated sequence of channels , and they promises the water out of the land , and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that this was working , not economically economically .
and environmental was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around this place are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
you have the flow of the water .
it literally , they used the lever .
instead of taking the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back again .
they curated the channels .
they created a $ 11,000 acre fish -- barky , marine , hisnische , aal , aal -- and then , miguel , and his company ecologically .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they &apos;re staring out at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and it &apos;s all they see , cursed channels and the density , abundant march .
i was not a long time with miguel .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of a snl .
ok ? there was us to go and fought through the wetlands and i swear , and i sweated , mam to my knees , and miguel is a biology .
here , here , he lifts a rare fac .
now it mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , he sees a pattern of bundles that reminds him to the tanzian giraffe .
it turns out that miguel has spent the biggest part of his career in midori national africa .
i asked him how he had become such a fish experts .
he said , &quot; did fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i am an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then it goes , and it rains more and more alien from rare birds and algae and odd water plants .
and understand me not wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unwarged , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i fell in love .
and my head became weak about this vorent piece of solid fish that i had on the front evening .
so i interrupted him . i said , &quot; miguel , what &apos;s your fish feel good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eating their fish ?
how is the risks ? &quot;
now , he &apos;s going on to tell me that it is such a wealthy system that the fish were eating , what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , this is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-serious .
there &apos;s no food .
the ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later the day later day , i went around with miguel around the day , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place , which seems to be different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
in the moment it was as if a film director would have to change a section .
and we filed around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of flaminies , an literally mind-blowing the eye so far enough .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your hand , pink .
she rides it . &quot;
worse ? floating ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , are you not floating your fish ? &quot;
it said , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing eggs to the birds .
well last year , in this site , 600,000 birds , more than 250 species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private birds in total europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is a good thing to get a long person to get up on a fish you want ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build plastic , not too much .
this is an environmental network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton exchange .
so the creators of the belly is better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s look at this : a farm that doesn &apos;t drive their animals and a farm that measure their success on the health .
flowing fishing , also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , this flamingos is not going to be there in the 1900s .
they breed from a town of 240 miles , where the soil feed nature is better for nest maintenance .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night , they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the sun &apos;s white line of land street .
seriously .
i &apos;d put a sort of trip of the penguins , so i looked at the guel .
i said , &quot; miguel , flies 240 miles to the farm and then fly back to the night ?
do you do that for children ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was a song of whitney &apos;s song .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i mentioned it &apos;s not mentioned the skin of my beloved , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s that cendless taste .
i almost never cooked with it .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in southern spain , they didn &apos;t mess until fishing skin .
and she ated and in fact , as if you take a bite off the ocean .
i mentioned about the miguel and he was .
he said , &quot; the skin feels like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last resort before something in the body .
it &apos;s been developing over the evolution of breaking undiscrimination . &quot;
and then he added them , &quot; but our water has no non-qualities . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that &apos;s worth their success &apos;s success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no non-pollination , it protects huge , because the water goes through this farm from this farm from the stream guescvivir in .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to lead all of the things that rivers today , today tend to lead them to lead to chemical pollutants from skull reduction .
and when it was fought by the system , and that &apos;s leaving the water clean than how it came .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that is measuring your success on the health , but a farm that &apos;s literally a faucting your fish , not only for those fish , but for you .
because when the water flows out , it locks in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should also do , because this love story , like romantic is romantic , is also telling .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barky or meat .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one , in which food is very well taste .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radically .
we &apos;re not more interested ; we &apos;re enjoying it . we &apos;re lover .
we love farmers markets . we love little family mills . we talk about local food . we eat aids .
and if you say that these things are the future of evil foods , somebody sits somewhere up and says , &quot; hey folks , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we create enough calories to feed the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are going to starve today .
one billion -- this is more than the before -- because of crashalans in the distribution , not the total production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because it has the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
fumging grain of plant crops , electroeloaded hazcultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken in fish , and the whole time , the agricultural industry simply asks , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful it could be ? &quot;
that was the volume . it was the law . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a commercial capacity , a commercial , very rapidly efficient capital that allows this production .
it &apos;s not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cornchamber is actually threatened today , not by driving off by depositing the resources .
not by the latest native arts and tractor innovations , but through fruit land , not by chains , but through frozen water water , not by climbing boats , and not through fishing boats , and not through fishing boats , and not through fishing boats , but by fish .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that empower every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural economy for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines stand at the top , and it never has something good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what comes back to two billion years of labor experience .
look at a guel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that don &apos;t have worlds for themselves , businesses , instead of mating , factories , services , the loads , instead of limited , farmers who are not just manufactured , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts in taste are also .
and if i &apos;m really honest , she &apos;s a better chef than i ever am .
you know , that &apos;s right because when the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to bring you one thing today is that the growth of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about information , i want to think about thinking about how we can use information , and we see that detect patterns that otherwise would not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical mortality diagram for age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with the gun is that i can filter for a certain cause , we say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it .
and that , because in the middle of the people , people are more active , and they &apos;re at the most places .
we can continue a step further and arrange the data , and see that morphing disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not everybody .
if we continue to go back and over age , we say 40 years or younger times we see that accidents are even the main thing that should worry about .
and who &apos;s going on in terms of research , that &apos;s true of all these days .
so what you realize is that the view of information and data is reminiscent in this way of swimming into a living information graph .
and if we can make that for raw data , why don &apos;t we do it for content itself ?
what we did here is the cover pictures of every single degree , &quot; ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can start to test it after my talk in your neighborhood .
with piming you can dive into a decade .
you can skip into a certain year .
you can jump directly to a certain sequence .
now , if i look here here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance , i &apos;m a lance , so i click here , which is mentioned to me in the lance armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a leg , i might think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all this theme ? &quot;
so i go back , and i &apos;ll explore the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that , if you look through this kind of information , you have to look at a wider , breathing , zoom out , you zoom out , you don &apos;t think of , or don &apos;t just choose .
you make something that &apos;s actually slightly different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now , i &apos;d like to leave this idea a little bit with something a little bit crazy .
what we did here is we took every single wikipedia , and we put them down on a small summary .
and the summary contains a quick exaggeration and a symbol for the area that comes out of .
i just put up the top 500 of the popular fortune in wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right now , we get a glimpse of the themes that are at the popular days .
i &apos;ll i choose the future of government .
well , after i picked up the government , i know that the wikipedia is conservative acatar , which is most likely to be at the time magazine of time magazine .
now this is really important because this is a insight that is not in a single wikipedia strip .
that &apos;s just to recognize when you sit down and look at it all .
so a certain of these summaries , i could then walk into the theme of time magazine , go to the year and see everybody else .
now , if i see all of these people , i realize that the majority of the government is experts , some coming from science . some , less , less , coming out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music .
and interestingly , it &apos;s also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump up and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re on the net at the center of the first time than whether it &apos;s a net , not just from page to side , but more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
pite , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites to look at it -- and we bring this zoom into every single website like this .
so i can go back and jump right to a specific configuration .
and so important is that &apos;s important because you can only look through websites in this way , and look at all the internet events in the same way .
so i can zoom in my course into a certain approach .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i thought i had to do .
and i can sort of look at everything that i &apos;ve been looking back now .
and , again , when i go back a step , and i look at all , i can rearrange my course , i can use my journey for my search past . here , i &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic &apos; am up here , or a live labs .
and from here , i can go to the site and get it back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to be used again , and every time it &apos;s going to make the size larger than the sum of the data .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a fluch .
we talk about the fluch of information .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning &quot; in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on your head , so that instead of going beyond one thing to the other , start to go from many things to build many things , and see patterns which would be left ?
if we can do that &apos;s where we can do , it &apos;s going to last source data trap , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just to move just into information , we can actually get out of it .
and if we learn knowledge , we can probably even pull away from it .
so thank me , thank you very much .
i grew up with a deaf society of science fiction .
in my school days , i went to school with high school every hour every day .
and my nose always put my nose in a book , a science fiction book , which led my mind to other worlds , and in the narrative , my deep , unsatied curiosity .
so this curiosity , though , if i was not in school , i used to go through the forests of the forests , the retreat and snakes and snakes and broochwater and broochwater , all looked at the microscope .
i was thrilled , really , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and render the boundaries of possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to hang down in my neighborhood , because at the time , in the late 60s , we flew to the moon and the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his amazing shows that we have found animals and places and the world of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
so , that seems very good to look at the science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i was able to draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video games yet had this transcendent collection with computer-generated investigating the whole narrative in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we were what we had to read that at the time , if we read a book , we took the description of the oysters , and we put it on canvas in our heads .
my response was to draw was drawing and painting by aliens , alien worlds , robots , space vessels and all of it .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , and i was hiding by the teacher .
the creativity had to go out .
and something interesting happened , something interesting , which was interesting to me at jacques coustefrom shows , which was the thought of an unknown universe here on our earth itself .
i am i never going to never reach a spaceship world with a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was just more interesting and exotic like all that i had imagined when i read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i decided to become a bee .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me with that .
i was being my father , until finally he &apos;d done a dive in buffalo in buffalo , new york , all over the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool of the charca in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , i have a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since 40 years since 40 , i spent about three hours of water , 500 hours in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the shallow seas , is so rich at amazing life , as we can &apos;t imagine it .
nature doesn &apos;t know no boundaries , as opposed to our own , maximum human imagination .
until today , i believe today , i feel deep awe for what i &apos;m seeing on my submersible .
and my love to the ocean continues , with the same intensity as ever and ever .
and when i was looking for an adult profession , it was the photographer to do it .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner commitment , to tell stories , with my need to create pictures .
as a child , i drew comic books all the time .
so , the films of the way were to bring pictures of pictures and stories . that was combined .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , from the science fiction show , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the abyss . &quot;
at &quot; the shock , &quot; i could connect my preloved word for the underwater world , and we connect with the client .
so basically my family experiences like my two passions .
something interesting happened at &quot; the abyss : in order to solve a narrative problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to create such a kind of liquid water , which we did on computer-generated animation , cg , back .
so what came out was the first computer-generated soft-in-surinterface that ever had to see in a film .
now , the film doesn &apos;t bring money , right now it was a production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience has been mesdened by the magic that went from it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , the law is known to be advanced technology and magic less than others .
so , something was something magical .
and that struck me incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that must be involved in film art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , still further .
together with ilm , we created the guys out of liquid metal , and the success depended on how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magically designed , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve already played a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences of experience , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , combined with my good friend stan stan , who was the best living upstairs , and i think it was a digital domain . &quot;
the idea of this company was it , the phase analogy of spreading processes with visual printers and begin in the same with digital product .
we then did that , and we managed to create a competitive advantage .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that in the folding field of design , we know , we know , we know , we know , we &apos;ve actually formed the company , we &apos;ve actually formed the company .
i wrote this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which should be a measure of visual effects and computer-generated effects in a new way of new heights , a realistic human , expressive characters that had been produced using cg , and the main figures should be built by cg , and the world should be cg .
but the cutting line pretty much back , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do that .
so , so i reshifted , and made this other film over the big ship that goes down .
the film studio , i sold the book romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became a love film , a passionate film .
but i wanted to just jump to the end of the titanic .
that &apos;s what i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced them , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to the wreckline . we &apos;ll film the real wreck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good open for marketing . &quot;
and i was talking to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy , it sounds crazy , but it goes back to that that your imagination can create reality .
we then created a reality at actually six months later , in which i found back to a russian submersible , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the actual titanic through a motorcycle .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no stone , that was real .
so , that blew my mind .
and the preparation of that were enormous . we had to build cameras and light lights and all sorts of things .
and i fell out of how much this deep-sea dives , a space mission .
yes , they were also advanced and they were able to become more sophisticated planning .
you go up into the capsule , then you &apos;re floating in this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope in rescue , if you can &apos;t go back .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same way i would be in a science fiction .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was so obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , from the part of doing curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure ; it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood to me .
because , you know , i could think i could make a creature that we could build a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the world expeditions of expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal vents , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes none of the times that no one had seen before the science of the time we saw them saw no words .
so that blew me right , and i wanted more .
and then i went up with an unusual decision .
after the success of the titanic , i told myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my job as a filmmaker in hollywood to ice , and for a long day explorer . &quot;
and then we started , we came out to the bismarck , and we were studying robots witness .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
we took little robots we built , which was a fiberbone cable .
our intent was to dive in and see the inside of the desert , which was never been done before .
nobody explored the inside of the wrecks , and you didn &apos;t have any funding . so we evolved the technology .
and i &apos;m going to sit on the deck of the titanic , in a dip , and see the graph that i &apos;m looking at here are pretty similar , and i know that once the band played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robotic stuff through the passage of the ship .
i actually , i am not , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was going to be present within the shipping wreck of the titanic .
this was the most common form form of a déjivu that i ever experienced . because before i had a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light cookie of the vehicle , because i went through a monthly set of film , when we took the film .
and the set of set was a very accurate copy of the tree plans .
so this was a very strange experience .
they were aware of this telereview experience that you use robotic notation and such your conscious mind in the vehicle , into this other forms of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a smaller look at which might happen in a couple decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore something or other things , in all sorts of post-human rights review that i can imagine science fiction fiction .
after these expeditions , we started learning what we saw at the bottom , for example , for example , like this deep level jellyfish , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with autosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunbased system like we do that .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degree centigrade , you can survive there .
and at the same time , i was interested in my space science , which was again the science fiction act from my childhood .
and so , i ended up to the people who are interested in , and they &apos;ve been doing the space with nasa , and at the nasa &apos;s memorizing and right space missions . they go through the mission of the mission of the biomedical protocol , and then they &apos;re going on the mission of the biomedical protocol , and then fly to the international space station , and take our 3d camerasweaving
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was because i took the space scientist with us in the deep sea .
and i took them up with sheep access to the world at the bottom : astrobiologist , planetary scientists , people who were interested in their extreme situations , and i took them on their sources so they were taking samples and test and test and make instruments .
i made documentary films , but actually , science , frankly , said , &quot; space science . &quot;
so the circle of a circle between my existence as science fiction , then as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of this discovery journey , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re certainly thinking , a director of a director , a leader of being a leader like ship capital or something .
and i don &apos;t understand much of leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why am i doing that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
this stupid thing doesn &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing a production costs right now . we don &apos;t trace a mistake .
everybody thinks i was running out of the titanic and &quot; avatar ran off , and there would be a champion of a towel in the beach somewhere .
i have all these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
no clouds , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to make it around the task of the challenge -- and the ocean is challenging , the most original environment that exists . you make it make it take it from the discovery of discovery , and because of strange connection link , that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked uninterrupted for years , and sometimes we were here to be central to the three months .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the ultimate thing that you have before each other is because you overcome a task that you cannot explain any other .
if you go to shore and says , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the full line , the whole technology , and the trouble that make human performance , &quot; then you can &apos;t explain the others . that &apos;s like a policeman or soldiers , you , you know that you , and know .
there &apos;s a link , mutual respect .
so when i went back to turn my next film to turn my avatar , i tried to employ the same leadership style , which is that you could respect his team and herself in the train of self .
it really , it really changed the dynamic .
so , again , i stood with a small team on unfamiliar terrain , and we were called &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t yet before .
exciting , exciting .
tremendous challenge .
and we became a five-family period of a very family period of time .
it changed my way of making films , completely .
there were people who thought we meant we had done these ocean creatures quite well and transported on the planet of the planet .
for me , it was more of principle to do my job , the actual process that was changed in the outcome .
so , what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think the first one is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the defining your team is more important than all the chickens in the world .
to me get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice like me . &quot;
and i say , &quot; ignoring you . &quot;
it &apos;s a lot of you for you . don &apos;t worry about yourself ; don &apos;t pay for yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a favorite sentence , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and in the investigation of exploration , it &apos;s got to be an alternative , because there is a guarantee of trust .
no important endeavor that involved in innovation , the risk of risk .
you have to be willing to take their risks like this .
that &apos;s the thought that i &apos;d like to leave you with to the path , is not an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i am talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something that is surprising , because my full-time occupation at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and the seed , to the things that we &apos;ve got to invent and provide to bring to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , even more important than others on the planet .
climate change means that their ads are not going to grow over many years , and it &apos;s too less flooding . the things are going to change their fragile environment .
that leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for them .
and also , the energy is very important for them .
in fact , if you know , if you could reduce the price of price , the poverty reduction is electricity from the most effective .
well , energy power of energy fell down over time .
in fact , the progression is based on energy progress .
the cooperative evolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very rapid case in electrical impact , and so we have refrigerators , climate care systems , climate , we make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we &apos;re going to the price -- let &apos;s get the price of the price -- we get to a new barrier , and this is a barrier of co2 combined .
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they planted 180 to the co2 , which leads to temperature increases , and these temperature increases , some very negative implications , impact on the weather , and maybe worse , according to indirectly , the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the rapid changes of such a rapid change systems .
now , the exrupt between a co2 increase and the resulting temperature change and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some unknown qualities , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certain strange things about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top times , i asked the top scientists , &quot; have we really got to go down near zero ?
isn &apos;t the half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than to say , we have to have a four-foot truck that has to get under a three-foot bridge , and then you can squeeze underneath underneath .
this must be on top , down to zero .
now , we &apos;re going a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american tons about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that beat it down to zero .
it &apos;s just a constant .
only different economic changes have been affected at all , and we need to go down from a rapid increase in size , and into a reduction down to zero .
this equation has four factors . there &apos;s a little bit more multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s dependent on the number of people , from the service that any human uses in the average , the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is being made the energy .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of a factor and think about how we get that at zero .
it probably has to get one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is rocket algebra , but we &apos;re going through .
first , we have the population .
today &apos;s 6.8 billion people .
and it works on nine billion . it &apos;s going to move to the nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccine , the health care of health care , we could probably reduce that for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time , we see a store in 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that includes everything that we eat , clothing , automobiles , heating .
these are very good things , and poverty reduction means to make these services accessible to each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make use and use less use , but in the average , that number every year , every year and more than double than doubled the number of the service per person .
so here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there &apos;s home light , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their school assignments under the street .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , gives it good news .
we have something that isn &apos;t rising .
because of a variety of different successes in the light sector , through other halls of total , through new methods , there are many services to reduce energy levels by 90 percent .
in other service , like the manufacturing of fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 56,000 : r &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; / 5 : 55 p.m. or air traffic or air traffic , the toys for improvement is much smaller .
all of course , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by a factor of a factor of three or maybe even about a factor of a factor 6 .
but in the first three factors , now we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to be the least 13 billion tons . and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this becomes a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s produced by co2 per unit of energy .
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get that on zero .
if you &apos;re burning coal : no .
when you &apos;re burning gas : no .
almost any manufacturing method for electricity today is co2 , except renewables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy miracle .
now , if i use the word wonder , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
normally , there &apos;s no silver that you need a miracle to a certain date .
it usually says that way , it &apos;s pretty soon , and some people get .
in this case , we need to get full of fresh gas , and get a miracle in a very short time .
well , i asked myself , how do i really bring this up ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration which is the idea of people built here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitoes and some people liked this .
the idea was really very physical , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
for energy , this is what i noticed .
and i decided that was going to be the free thing of fireflies in my natural year will be the environment of the environment .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
you realize , you don &apos;t bite , you probably won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get all a lot .
we need solutions , either one or several that have an incredible scaling and unimaginable regularity , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i really see five , which can afford those big demands .
i have been dropping out of time , gecing fusion and biofuels .
you might spend a modern contribution , and if you score more than i expect , that &apos;s great , but my core statement here is that we need to do none of all the five work , and we can &apos;t give up from them because all of all have a significant problems .
let &apos;s see first look at the burning fossil fuels , either coal , either coal , or gas .
what you have to do there is maybe easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that comes after burning out of the chimx , capture under pressure , and you go somewhere and hoping that there is .
there &apos;s a couple of pilot projects that make that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent accuracy , but it &apos;s going to be very hard on 100 percent , and it &apos;s a big challenge for the waste of co2 , but the biggest issue here is a big challenge , but the biggest issue .
who &apos;s going to make it up ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billions times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so , this is a tough kiss .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s like three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , the question of security that you really feel that nothing can be done wrong , despite the human profession that the fuel cannot be used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so , three very hard problems that might be solvable , and that &apos;s how to work .
the last three of five have summarized .
it &apos;s renewable rates as they &apos;re often called .
and the ones who have -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have a few postparts .
one is the energy requirement that make these technologies are generating dramatically less than the power plants .
these are energy fuel , you &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , a thousand times more land than a normal power station .
and also , subversive sources of crime .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , and it doesn &apos;t seem like every day , and the wind isn &apos;t the wind .
that &apos;s why you know , if you depend on these sources , have a way to get the energy in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there &apos;s great price challenges here . there are challenges in the transmission of transmission , if we say , for example , the energy source outside of the country is , it doesn &apos;t take not just the technology , and you need to avoid the risk of the risk where the energy from .
and there are congestion problems .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve been built all sorts of batteries , looking at cars , computer , mobile phone cells , for everything , and that i &apos;ve used to the amount of electronic energy , which i found is that all the batteries that we produce now , less than 10 minutes of the transformation .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to tell this subbrofusive sources of say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the use .
if you want to encourage you about 100 percent , you need an incredible silver battery .
well , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
one of the manhattan project ? how do we get to target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of companies .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
many people are going to say they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think in the ted group , i think there are many people involved in there .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , called esolar that has great solar species technologies .
vinsuffers kholic a spends in dozens of thousands of companies who make great stuff and interesting possibilities and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that might pursue a nuclear approach to me .
there are a couple of innovations in the nuclear scale , modular , liquid .
well , we stopped in this industry in front of a while , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are going around .
the terramation concept means that instead of one part of the urater , which is one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , in fact , you &apos;d think about it for a long time , but you couldn &apos;t figure out whether it &apos;s going to work , but since then modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and seeing it , and you see , yes , with the right materialistic approach , it looks like it &apos;s going to work .
and because you burn this 99 percent , cost of cost is much better .
and in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of current reactors as a propulsion .
instead of break over the head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the urinference , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often known as &quot; the rise wave reactor . &quot;
this really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that gets burned today , so it &apos;s called the brightly uranium .
the u.s. for the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you get rid of ocean water , and you just put it up , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what would we look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the interward .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , and it &apos;s still being done with agriculture , and hopefully it &apos;s going to be clean and cement .
so to reach this 80 percent , industrialized nations , including countries like china , their electrigeneration generation altogether .
the other note says whether we use the $ zero emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way , getting them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
that becomes a key element of that unity .
if we go back there , what about the 2020 of that 2020 ?
and it should contain it again .
we should use it to use more effective , to bring reductions into the path , and the less we get a price of animals , the smaller it will be the co2 sum , and the temperature .
but actually , this grade is the things that we do for companies that are not entirely done to the large reductions , just the same , or even something less than the other who is the speed of innovation to innovation .
we need to track these breakthroughs , and we can measure that , in corporate trials , in pilo-projects and regulation changes .
there are many great books on this subject .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays &quot; sustainable energy from hot air . &quot;
they really walk it up and create a frame where this can be discussed , because we need help from all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very simple wish is that we invent this technology .
if you have a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and the love i choose , or i could choose this wish , which is , you know , halved energy without co2 without co2 . this wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish to get rid of the long term and short-term objects , between the united states , between the united states and china , between arms and rich , and we &apos;re going to be very worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for what do what do you do ?
we need to put in more research money .
when countries meet themselves in places like coping down , they shouldn &apos;t talk about co2 .
they should talk about these innovation strategy , and they would be shocked by the kind of small way they were going to spend for these innovative approaches .
we need market ators , tax gas tax , cap &amp; amp ; nike is something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to make dialogue and refreshing dialogue , and the things that are happening by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand terrapower something better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to make the simulation on a supercomputer , get all big scientists that we &apos;ve done , we just need a few tens of millions , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , that it works that it &apos;s only in a couple of millions .
the hard step is building the first thing we can build , to find more billions of galaxies , the standard ages and the first one .
once the first thing is done , if it &apos;s going to work like this , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic , energy is so different than nuclear power as we know it .
so to understand to understand , to build deep into the ground , almost like a vertical nuclear spider nuclear fuel , that compated uranium , and then the process starts up and works further ?
bg : right . now you have to put the reactor up , so there &apos;s a lot of people , and many people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing is opening and that &apos;s not good .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a pillar -- that you &apos;re buried , without all the intrities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it burns 60 years long , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor that offers a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what happens on the garbage : you can leave him seats -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with this method -- then you take it and you put it into the next one and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already there , which is in these refrigerates or dry beds of reactors . that &apos;s our starting fuel .
so , what is a problem has been a problem for these reactors , which is what we put in our combined and it &apos;s dramatically reduces the waste volume as this process .
but while you &apos;ve chatted with different people around the world .
where &apos;s the greatest interest , what is really about making ?
bg : now we don &apos;t add us on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting sensorial rules for all the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there were big interest and the company were in russia , india , and i was here , and we &apos;ve talked about energy .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know the french and the japanese did something in the direction .
this is one is a thing that was done .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and a few countries built this , so everyone has done a quick reactor , a candidate for our first .
in your imagination : sobering and probability of being able to make life in life ?
bg : now we need one of these scaling , carbon-generating things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got to reinvent 20 years and then use 20 years .
that &apos;s kind of the deadline that we saw the environmental models that we need to put .
and , you know , terrapower , if all goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , that could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , the ones that work can work for their investment for their pilots to offer .
and it would be best if it &apos;s multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
on each case , we need a solution .
what &apos;s the biggest breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing that you know ?
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important breakthrough .
it would have been challenged , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in a nuclear sector are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the biological method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems a little bit hard , but maybe you tell us about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about this is that an initial molecule has a million times as much energy , so we say , a coal molecule , and so if you can deal with the problems , the footprint , the energy , the potential , it , the impact on the country and other things , almost in a own liga .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we need to lead an emergency care to keep trying to keep the temperature stable ?
bg : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like if you were eating too much , and it &apos;s a heart attack . what do you do ? maybe you need a heart operation or something .
there is there a research called geoengineering , which is associated with different techniques to delay warming so we would be given 20 or 30 years longer to get us together .
that &apos;s just one insurance method .
you hope we hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t only work at insurance because you might be lazy , so you continue to eat , because you know that one of the heart surgery is saving .
i don &apos;t know if you do the importance of seeing the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discentric course in geoengineering about whether you should have that available , if things can get faster or innovation anymore than we expect .
climate rikeptics : do they have one or two sentences to convince you might possibly persuade ?
bg : well , unfortunately the skeptics in very different camps lives .
those who make the scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell you , that there &apos;s a chance of a million .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
you now you doing the mistakes , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s the idea , right now , if you have all kinds of experimental problems , invest in something you &apos;ve only done before -- and is that the investment isn &apos;t so clear , necessarily the ipcc report not necessarily the worst assumption , and there are people in the rich world , and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should be worried about us .
but my dream here is , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 is removed , again , according to the skeptics , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t really care that it doesn &apos;t be carbon , i wish it &apos;s more about it , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the bjn lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy around the co2 , all the other targets of preventing poverty , the poverty reduction , and so on that it &apos;s that it &apos;s a dumb waste of resources to invest , while there are better things we can do .
bg : well , the actual cost of research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- it &apos;s not so dramatic .
there shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get to get too big money , and here &apos;s a reasonable thing that can contradict a reasonable person if you have something that have something that &apos;s not economic , and tries to fund that .
it &apos;s , you know , there &apos;s a very brief breakthrough , funded only the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very expensive .
if the bottom you get , you &apos;re a very high energy supply , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing your lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even you know , even , you know .
and his new mabes now is , &quot; why is the research not shared anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going , because of his former stories , with the skepit-camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s now bringing the research argument now .
and that &apos;s an thought that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just nuts , it &apos;s just fun .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all the people , if i say , i hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter scillman wrote a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . four teams have to build the biggest possible liquid structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about 1m tape , built about 1m tape and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and , although it really seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard because people tie very quickly working .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , developers , and architects , even with ctos of the fortune of money , and there &apos;s something about this task , which allows deep sensations in nature , and i want to share some of them with them .
normally , most people start to orient themselves to the task .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about what &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re making power .
then you put a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they scriprint it and put spaghetti out .
they &apos;re investing in a lot of their time in the wider structures .
and finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , somebody pulls the marshmallow up , and they sit down the tip , they &apos;re going back , and they &apos;re a step back and &quot; admire your work .
so , anyway , it &apos;s almost always , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; is &quot; oh , because the weight of the marshmallow does that the whole thing to bend .
there &apos;s a series of people who have &quot; uh-uh-uh-oh moments , than others , and among the worst ones are fresh bwl graduates .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re really empowering constructing .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; ta-da shapes , and among the best are fresh students &apos; toilets .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us not only make them the highest towers , but also the most interesting structure of all .
what you might be asking is : how is this ? why ? what about those ?
and peter told peter : &quot; none of the children in the head is going to spend the head of spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in power struggle .
there is another reason though .
namely , that bwl students were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and then it was that .
so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what &apos;s going to do the child &apos;s homes is that they start with the marshmallow and prototyping , successful prototypes , always on the marshmallow on the top , so that they have the possibility to fix the opportunity to repair prototypes .
so constructively recognize these kinds of collaboration as a core disexplored .
and with each attempt , children get immediate feedback in what works and whatnot .
so the performance , with prototypes , is very important -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operating .
most of the average of the inch , bwl students create half of them , lawyers but not much , children &apos;s homes are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
1m is the highest what i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and accountability sources of the geometric pattern are key to build stable structures .
ceos lie on average . but here it is interesting .
if you think of an exectile administrator in the team , they become significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see yourself and recognize that team will win .
you can predict this . why is that ?
because they have special skills of processor .
they &apos;re running the process , you know .
and this team , that team , the mood , and on the work , it gets the potential of the team better .
specialized skills and process skills and their combination leads to success .
if you get 10 teams , you &apos;ll get about six , you get a stable structure .
so i tried something interesting .
i thought we &apos;ll bring the poop up right .
so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize for software for the winner .
what do you think about this design student ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a two-inch construction construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high accidents have a strong effect ?
we talked about these exercise with the same students .
so , what happened now ?
now , you understand the prototype .
so , for the same , bad team was among the best .
it produced the highest construction in the very time .
there &apos;s there are a lessons for us , about nature and success .
you might ask , why , why would anybody actually invest for creating a marshmallow ?
the reason is , i need to make digital tools and processes processes to help team , save cars , video games and the visual .
and what &apos;s happening the marshmallow challenge is they &apos;re helping to identify them false .
because , frankly , every project has his marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a shared language , a common language , or the rule of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , you can visit the marshmallow .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a step-by-step guide there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , how people are refining the system and refining .
there also also be a revolution .
and the present lesson , i think , actually , the apparatus is actually a commitment .
it demands that we all make our senses in the task , and we use our thinking of how our feelings and our work , in the challenge that we do is doing .
and sometimes a small prototype of that experience is what needs to bring us from one &quot; name &quot; -- to a &quot; taop &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s pretend a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to get in .
and you can go to the past , you can walk into the future ; you can &apos;t sit here and now .
and i wonder what they would pick , because i &apos;ve asked this question last time , and they wanted to all go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back before there was cars or twitter . &quot; america searches . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that somehow you &apos;ve got to be a nostalgic , to wig you .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of the group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurer .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet doesn &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that has ever existed on this planet , whether it &apos;s scaling it : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , wise disease rates .
there never had a time than this .
my great-grandparents died all of them as they were 60 .
my grandparents got the number at 70 .
my parents are the 80 to the heel .
so there should be better than nine at the beginning of my death .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that is born today in new delhi is expected to be as long as the richest man in the world in 100 years .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . smallpox had killed billions of people on this planet .
you &apos;ve got to reinvent the demographics of the earth into a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we conforced them . puff .
in the rich world there are diseases that only have been threatened by a generation , not yet .
dipha , you know , mothers .
anyone else know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions , these are successes of science .
and from my perspective , the scientific way of trying to test things , see if it works , it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole good news is , there are a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world walk every day to sleep .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s getting very quick , and that &apos;s really embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to devaend this world .
drinking water , ancient land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t make us out of the chaos , we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land that they live , to rape .
i think we can supply this world with energy that doesn &apos;t obey .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a wisty thinking .
but this is still waking up at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night , and we &apos;ve never had science progress yet as well as well .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it accountable , as we can today .
we &apos;re very amazing , we have amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds of millions of years , 300 years ago , to find a period of progress we have to fight progress in which we &apos;ve got over these things that we have more broadly down .
people are overweight in their belief , so tightly so that you can &apos;t get them free .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right thing in his opinion ; even a right to the progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right with their own facts . i don &apos;t have it .
and i needed a while to figure out this .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to emulate resistance towards what was the most effective activity in health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what was going to do , so i just did what i always do , i was writing an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic technology , and i wrote an article about genetic food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing nuts .
so i wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules on a certain way of a random way a random approach to the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the paper , i continued .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type we type , we &apos;re rich , we go food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and then i found it .
and it &apos;s because these fanatics who were nuts at all of me were no doubt .
these were surrounded people , including people , separate people .
they were exactly like people in this room .
and that brought me so confused ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio for progress as we used to .
we talk about beetic .
we talk about it , with little sign marks , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there is no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call a few name and people will understand .
cherute , , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are problems and problems with the people that we believed that they &apos;ve always been right , so they &apos;re skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
take nothing for granted no .
but now , if you get the evidence , you &apos;ve got to accept that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can tell that from the reason that now we &apos;ve never seen it in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and i &apos;ve never seen again .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that brought a autism epidemic with the masker , mugested aluminum , and roman vaccine in connection .
very scary .
so studies of studies were done to see if that was true .
high-performing studies should be done ; it &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came from the u.s. from the united states , from the u.k. , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no way .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we think we see what we see , what we think is that we feel really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a pool of documents from a government that &apos;s available to us , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating .
superman is one of the fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which they fall down for scarcity is falling down .
this is scandans , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i understand that .
because one have somebody else ?
have a single one in the audience ever come to dying ?
didn &apos;t happen very often .
at that happens in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the last year .
these are many deaths from mases , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can actually measure it , and people like electromccarthy can be walking around and humor about fear and liberal king live and larry king live .
and you can do that because it doesn &apos;t connect the cause of it .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salad .
he was liberating us from one of the worst spirit of humankind .
no fear , no open children , hairh , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
it &apos;s called paul confusion .
he &apos;s developed with a couple of other people a few other people who develop the rotavirus vaccine .
it can save the lives of 480 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
now , that &apos;s good , besides the fact that paul is walking around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and they want to stop people .
and this is what he says .
so paul is a terrorist liberation .
when paul is speaking in a public voice , he can &apos;t be a chemist without armed guards .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are unusable .
take it out , return the diseases back , terrible disease , and that &apos;s what happens .
we now have in this country now .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die in scarcity .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a funny piece of comedy wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and said , i think i &apos;m a little bit of hyperbole .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her kid against the children of egypt .
thank you .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any child paralysis . and you know what ?
we had no family in this country in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe , in the lagos , somebody in lagos is sitting in a plane , flies , and fly to los angeles , right now , in ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he ends up and wore a car , and he comes out of long beach , and he &apos;ll visit one of those fantastic tedtalk dinner tonight tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a limb of disease , and we don &apos;t know it , because it works the world .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as it doesn &apos;t .
we love to keep overagreements . we love that .
have you ever taken your vitamins tonight ?
echinacea , a small antioxidantium that helps you to help them .
i know that you &apos;ve done this because half of the americans do this everyday .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
data is the data on all the data .
they &apos;re dark their urine . more more , they never ever .
that &apos;s okay , you like to pay about 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why are we doing this ?
well , i think i understand that we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have any trust into the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and open to ourselves that can afford it .
so we &apos;re running out of that , and where do we go ?
we run into the arms of the placebo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
but , you know , this is a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;ll give billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little proclaws here .
ka one of these -- reko , cheating , echinacea , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re going to get billions of dollars , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream in and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do what they want .
that &apos;s what they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because i don &apos;t care about whether it &apos;s the health minister , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to tell the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any carcins-squoves that treat your patients want to caffle assessment . &quot;
if you get out of this path , where believe and magic evidence are replacing science , you &apos;ll get to a place that you don &apos;t want to be .
they go to thabo mabki in south africa .
he took 400,000 of his people around , because it insisted that red controls , bone and lemon oil are much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of malnutrition in a country that will be worse than any other of that disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
now , the brain of the original epidemic that we &apos;re seeing now is this corrupt struggle between the support of the support of genetic foods and bio-elite .
that &apos;s an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single bescorn , every branch of parley , each , every roddess , has changed by the people .
you know , there were no clients in paradise .
there were no canhood of melts .
there was no christmas trees . we did this all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them doesn &apos;t work and don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of it doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely , and of course , there &apos;s risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff that can help millions of people , millions of people , increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we countertechnology changed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m going to hear is : many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have a huge field of fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want firms to be oppressed .
we don &apos;t want firms to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge nutrient problem , but that &apos;s not rocket science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know , the science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we fear it &apos;s a dead end , and it holds millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than the next 50 years , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame , embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? genetic technologies changed .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this malignant stuff like maniam ok .
yes is something that you eat half a half billion people .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a sack of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all that right now .
and then people could eat that and would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starze , and they know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be a gun , but it would be nice .
and all i can tell you is , why do we struggle this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why are we fighting this ?
because we don &apos;t want to attract genes around ?
it &apos;s not about cutting genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about your ridiculous passion for hormones , our behares on larger food , better nutrition , unique food .
it &apos;s not about a rice crisis , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s becoming the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do that as usual , we do something that we do something that we think , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s self-addictive , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not our way , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
definitely . that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , in the present tense , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we will move where we want .
we &apos;ve got to think these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine and we &apos;ll go into the future we will be happy to do that .
i know that we can do it , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to me , that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some times , i &apos;m interested for the placebo effect , and it may seem strangely to be a magician , because , in fact , they look like me as a delusion , as a deception that &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s going to be overwhelmed enough . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have demonstrated a measurable effect , the placebo effect , only because the person thinks what happens to her was a pharmaceutical or a pharmaceutical management , for example , because if the patient is overwhelmed enough to believe in the body that is a messer in the body that &apos;s the placebo effect .
one delusion becomes something secret , because somebody is so aware .
so we understand each other , i want to show you a radical , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every magical book for children .
i myself learned him from the cub scout of magical paths in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll explain it for you and explain him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife that you can study , is my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife like that .
i &apos;m going to leave my slecker back .
and to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my miserable way , or out of him , i &apos;ll just push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time moves anything , as long as i get into press , nothing can &apos;t walk out in my slelt .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i &apos;m hoping , if anything &apos;s going well , the knife will absorb by my bare physical magnetism .
it actually sits like this place that i can shake without the knife .
nothing walks in my sleeve or comes out , not a speaker , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , that &apos;s a trick that i often take a lot of kids interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you know , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably a lot of you know here in the room .
this is what it works .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my miserable will disappear or hits , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i &apos;m very old my wrist is that it &apos;s the secret to the illusion .
because right now , where i turn my hand out of you , you can see it from the back of the back , this finger , and my time , just from where it was , in a position that he &apos;s so extended .
great trick ?
there is somebody in the back there that no childhood had .
so , here it is here . right .
and when i turn around , the fingers changes the position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t notice that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it works information , one , one , two , three , but three , it sees a group .
but that &apos;s not about that now . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s being held in there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my pitch , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing that i turn back , is tucked through this movement that it moves back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s a knife .
this trick can show you with friends and neighbors . thank you .
well , what has this got to do with the placebo effect ?
a year a year or so , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
it turns out is , if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form of an aspirinpill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain trend effect .
but if you make the shape that you give the free clothing , for example , into a smaller pill , and color that blue color and a letter that you see , it &apos;s actually measurable more efficient .
and that , although none of these pharmaceuticals is -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really broke me out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a rat , it &apos;s more effective than it &apos;s more effective than it &apos;s not incremental .
a colored capsule that is at a very yellow one and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the domation also plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember exactly the statistics . sorry .
and the key thing is ...
... that &apos;s the way the memes play too .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with an effective piece -- a few milliliters of an effective substance that you injected to a patient .
that creates a very strong picture in head , and that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
this graph is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time when we put a projector .
so , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as well as the blue pill , not as well as a capsule that does not work as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really pharmaceutical property , it &apos;s only our belief in us that make a stronger impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magician .
i &apos;ll take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and i &apos;ll leave you look real .
we know from the study that you need to reach a needle when it should go .
this is an 18-by-inch needle . it &apos;s very , very , very big , and i &apos;m going to make it a little bit of structure .
this is actually my meat . it &apos;s not a fast picture special meat .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not an special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick up this needle into my skin and drive it through it , until you &apos;re touching the other side .
in case , if you &apos;re bad -- if you drop a little bit of it -- i &apos;ve taken a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and became a woman almost become a woman .
so i &apos;m going to suggest about , if you &apos;re going to make quickly miserable , look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first climb in the back .
you can see it right now , but you can see , even as you want .
so , it &apos;s going on , right here , where my meat starts , at the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to cut down .
i &apos;m really sorry . does you crazy this ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had the knife .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
so , let me show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
you say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and avoiding the skin , just to talk a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show it to you .
so what about this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people would say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen it right . &quot;
the people in the room come in now .
so let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not an special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn around .
sorry . i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re bad , you look away , don &apos;t look .
people in the back or the ones that later see the video later , &quot; well , &quot; well , this is a pretty scary thing , but if it would be real , it would be a hole , and if it really would be really true , it would be tall . &quot;
okay , let me squeeze a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
and usually would take the needle now .
i would clean up my arm and show them that there are no wothers .
but i think in this frame here and with intent , from a deception , to make a difference , i &apos;m just going to make the needle right from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have some people who count the number of books that have been published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 to about 40 , and there was much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there are a lot of fun coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all these landings of work , there are multiple cognitive ones that actually make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be mainly about that cognitive fall .
it &apos;s true of laughter , and it &apos;s very lucky about their own happiness , and it &apos;s fair to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so confused as anybody else .
the first one of these fall is a contradiction , which admit , to admit .
it turns out the word happiness is not a useful word , because we &apos;re applying it into many different things .
i think there is there a certain meaning that we might reduce it , but in a large space , that &apos;s something we need to be given up , and we &apos;re going to have to take complicated perspective of what well-being is well-being .
the second trap is a diverse process of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happiness in its life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both packed in the notion of happiness .
and the third one of the marketing illusion illusion , and this is the happy fact that we don &apos;t think about the way we think of a situation that affects well-being without damage , without damage .
i mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who was asking a questionwriter session after one of my lectures , who wrote a story . &#91; unclear &#93; said he had said he &apos;d heard a tester , and it was absolutely glorious music , and on the end of the recording there .
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was feeling about memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he got to keep .
what we really tell us is saying that we might think about us and about other people in terms of two types of self .
there &apos;s one of self that lives in the present , and the present one is capable of experiencing the past , but it &apos;s basically the present .
it &apos;s the living self that &apos;s the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt you ? &quot;
and then there is a sense of self , and the self is reminised , and it &apos;s reflecting the story , and it &apos;s because of course , the physician is talking about asking the question , by saying , &quot; how did you feel you feel lately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey were in albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living self and the memory self , and the two is part is part of the progress of happiness from happiness .
now , remember self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts right now .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , if we &apos;re going to tell us stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to keep ourselves from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients in patients who are attracted to a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not more painful nowadays , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more , and his gut reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how very these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient &apos;s a much worse reminder had a lot more worse than a patient .
the stories of the stories were different , and because a very important part of history is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very sophisticated or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse it was where the pain was at the end of his height , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their gut mirror , and a lot later later , &quot; how bad was all the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the memory .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory self .
from a living self , b was clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with a patient , and we actually do clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually increase the darmreflection of the patient , just putting the letbiting the hose without hitting it .
this is going to lead the patient , but only a little less and much less than before .
and if you do that a couple of minutes , you realize that the living itself of the patient is worse , and you &apos;ve managed to figure out that the patient a lot , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story about his experience .
what is a story is going on ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that makes memory us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
as a story of a story of origins , meaningful eyes and ends up .
witness are very , very , very important , and in this case , branched the end .
well , living self lives his life continuously .
it &apos;s eye &apos;s eye view , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most halls of our lives -- and i &apos;ve convinced that -- you know , the psychological presence is true than about three seconds , which means , in a lifetime , there are about 600 million of them . in a month is about 600,000 , most of them don &apos;t leave you .
most of you are completely ignored by the memory self .
and yet , somehow get the impression that you should count , that what happens during this eye &apos;s mind is going to happen .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use when we are in the world .
and as we get them be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory itself .
so we have the self &apos;s memory and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about the time .
from the spirit itself , if you have a holiday and the second week is as good as the first one , then the two week is twice the week vacation is twice as a week .
it doesn &apos;t work at all .
for remembering itself , a weekly week is hardly even better than a week vacation is because there is no new memories that are going to be added .
you haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a reminiscent of self in a living self , very little impact on this story .
now , the self is getting more powerful than remembering and storytelling .
it &apos;s the thing that matters the decisions , because if you have a patient who had a patient , you know , we have two gut reflection at two different surgeons , and decide of course , what he &apos;s going to vote , who is choosing , that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s chosen .
the living self doesn &apos;t have any voice in that election .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between wisdom , we vote between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future usually .
we think about our future as false memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a flash of the memory of the memory self , and you can remember the self as well as one , which is sort of like the living self that you don &apos;t get to experience that , living itself .
i have the impression that when we make a holiday that &apos;s very often the case , that means that we make holiincidents in the service of the memory self .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how do we buy our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance of memory itself .
and if i think about it , i think about a holiday we &apos;ve done a couple of years ago in antarctica , which was clearly vacation i had ever had , and i think pretty often in the relationship of how often , i think of other vacation .
and i &apos;ve probably entered my memories of this three-week trip , and i would say , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures i had spent a more hour .
well , this is three weeks , and that &apos;s only about a year and a half hours .
there seems to be an indiscrimination .
now , i like a little bit extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the tens of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question : why do we make memories so many memories on the weight that we experience ?
so i want you to think about an thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation , you have wiped out all your pictures , and you get a amnestic drug that you &apos;ll never remember .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you ask a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self , and you &apos;ve got to think about how you decide this conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you can think about the sense , and if you know , if you in the senses , and if you think in the senses of memories , and if you think in the senses of memories
why we pick up the vacation that we choose is a problem that provides a choice between the two kinds of self .
well , the two types of self is taking two words in happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the eyes of life in life ?
and you &apos;re all -- happiness for eye is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a fairly good idea of happiness &apos;s happiness about the time .
if you ask for the happiness of the memory self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not what a person lives .
it &apos;s like pleasure or pleasure that person is when that person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anybody who doesn &apos;t mix these terms is the research of happiness , and i &apos;ve been listening to a lot of researchers about well-being in terms that have been focused on a long time of happiness .
so the distinction between happiness itself , and the happiness of the memory self , has been recognized in the last few years , and now that you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a global survey for a worldwide survey where there were more than half a million people wondering what they think about their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning the happiness of both of self .
and the main lesson we think , learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how to be satisfied with your life , and it doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of visualizing the correlation , the correlation between five is five .
what that means is that if you were able to meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a two-meter , how much would you know about his greatness ?
well , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has lived as eight on a number of 10 , they have a lot of insecurity about how happy it is with its living self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what &apos;s going on happiness .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly meant to be satisfied with people we like to spend time with people that we like to .
there are other pleasure , but this is a dominant one .
so if you want to encourage the happiness of your self , you &apos;ll be able to do very different things .
so the implication of what i said here is that we don &apos;t really think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we don &apos;t know about happiness is that we don &apos;t care about the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california are not going to get the correct answer .
so if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier if they say , they &apos;re in italy .
and what &apos;s happening is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , let &apos;s say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the ultimate self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the foreself is responsible , you can turn at the end -- some people might jump to california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are moving to california in hope to become happier .
well , their lifestydness is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re thinking about it , you &apos;re going to be remembered how awful the weather district in ohio , and you feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about comfort , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we shoot a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of the gallup survey .
is this something that can allow us to be , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahne: sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup with the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t think about .
we found it in terms of happiness itself .
when we looked at how feelings are variability .
and it turns out , under 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , under the year from 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly happier , the poorer people will be .
and we get a completely flat line on this .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money feed you no experience of happiness , but that lack of money releases is certainly misery , and we can measure this miserable , very clear .
in the spirit of the other self , the memory self , they get a different story .
the more money you deserve the happiness is you .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , the whole american bequest is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
so when people take advantage seriously , i mean , it seems to be able to put it all on the head , all we think , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians can actually take advantage of the country , generally , would be able to take the seriously and based on politics based on it ?
dk : you know , i think that there is evidence for the role of happiness in politics .
the success will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries you &apos;re going on .
people are deciding that they should be thinking about happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether you want to explore happiness , or whether you think about life review , so we need to lead this discussion pretty quickly .
how do you get lucky to become very different depending on how you think about it and whether you think about remembering yourself or whether or whether you think about the living self .
this is affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re struggling to measure the experience of happiness in the united states .
this is , i think , in the next decade or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , or at least at least the most interesting policy debate , it seems to pursue the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahne.
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i call video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to save the world in the reality , as it &apos;s in online .
i have a plan for it . i &apos;d like to convince more people , including all of them , more time with playing more time with play more and more honest games .
right now , we spend three billion hours a week with online games .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time , if you think about how many problems we really need to solve in the real world .
well , in fact , my research researcher in the future , is exactly the opposite is moving .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world .
in fact , i am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time dramatically .
i calculated that it estimated that this is a week in 21 billion hours per week .
this may seem like a little bit more distant , so i &apos;m going to make it work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture is pretty much about why i believe that games are so vital for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portoman &apos;s sister toledano photographer .
he wanted to capture the feelings , so he &apos;s built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic acts of games .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you want to rely on a few other times in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also at first concentration , to a very difficult problem .
if you play play , you see a few more , you see here after the top of the top eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrow hiner .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of one of the book of a book .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have a couple of players here .
one epic victory is a result , which is so very positive that they didn &apos;t even know it was possible at all .
it was beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to be able to do something like that . that &apos;s a epic victory .
this player is very short victory .
and this is what we need to see on the millions of problems of problem-solving in the world , if we take the obstacles from the nearest century , the face of whom are the opposite of all the most wotitudes on the edge of a epic .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in the real life when we encounter hard problems .
i call it as the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me how i &apos;m the &quot; in life i am bad .
this is a graffiti in my former school in berkeley , california , where i studied in my thesis interview why we &apos;re better in playing with playing lives than the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think that we &apos;re not as good in games .
and i don &apos;t mean only less , even though that .
we &apos;re doing more in playing worlds . i mean , with motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired by collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a toy , i believe that many of us will turn into our best version , anytime and immediately , are willing to help solve the problem , so long as necessary and try to make it again again .
and in reality , if we fail to the obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel we beat us . we feel threatened ; we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynically .
we never have these feelings if we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d .
why is it possible to think in games , to think , you couldn &apos;t just reach anything ?
how can we translate these feelings into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft that offers ideals to solve the collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed a few things that are going to be the epical doodling in online worlds .
so , first of all , if you get in one of these online games , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to trust you a world mission to trust .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level , right ?
so bring this .
they never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their ability , so you have to get a little bit , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn out . there &apos;s always a big way to do .
and there are hisseways .
where you can you go , hundreds of thousands of people working together with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in real life , that feeling that if you have a fingershard employee .
there are this epic story , this inspirational story , which is why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve described by &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 starer &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have one + 1 + and + 1 mad idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
so , the issue of race online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at the edge of a epic past , that we prefer to spend our whole time in these toys .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of warshock player , 5.93 million years combined with the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it might sound nasty .
but in order to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , we started walking out our first primate ancestors .
so the first popular thing .
ok , so , if we &apos;re talking about how much time we &apos;re spending with games right now , that only sense , when you keep time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate , because it turns out that by using these whole times , we actually change the change of how people are capable of .
we develop environments to collaborative , we build .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
if you look at the interesting statistics , which was published by a researcher at carnegie university , the average young man of today in a country with big play culture has spent 10,000 hours of 10,000 to the 21st of life .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 hours of hiv who are spending them in school , by grade high school , at the fifth school degree -- if you never have to .
so we have a complete parallel initiative here , where young people learn the same way , what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overloaded . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success for 10,000 hours of success .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the arduous literature at the time of a thlike to the 21st of life , we &apos;ll be the head .
we &apos;re going to do that as well as to do what the most important people in the world are doing .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people , the masterpieces .
so the big question is , &quot; well , what exactly is player champiologically good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we actually had never had an unprecedented human potential .
so many people in the world are now in the world that spend at least one hour a day with online games .
these are our master-player : 500 million people , the extraordinarily good ones in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade , we have another billion players , which is extraordinary as well as well .
don &apos;t have it yet .
the play industry developed blindness that save energy and work on mobile phones , instead of the ultra-band internet , so the players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil , or brazil play online online .
you &apos;d expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so , so i started thinking about what it is , what &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do is to master .
so here are the four things that i thought : first : test optimism .
ok , think about the extreme self-motivated .
the optimism optimism optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to master , to believe that we have a proven hope for success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth to try and make it right .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the plants of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like to think of people more than we &apos;ve been playing with them , even though they cried ourselves .
the reason for that is that there requires a lot of trust with someone to play a game .
we &apos;re we trust that somebody &apos;s spends time with us , that the rules will be counted , that we have the same goal , until the player end .
so , it allows them to grow , and trust , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relations .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the average word of baseball players are playing 22 hours per week , as opposed to a part-time job .
the reason is that when we play play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings work seriously , if we do hard , significant work done .
and the players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , inical meaning .
the players love to become part of the romantic missions of art replication .
here &apos;s a quick dinal formation to break this in the right side . you know all wikipedia , the world &apos;s biggest nightmare .
the second largest headline in the world , with nearly 80,000 , is the world of warcraft of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have combined information about the world of warcraft of warcraft in the internet than any other theme in any other headline in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one result . players are super powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single .
and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward cavering ova is a medical scientist .
his work is genius . he explores why humans spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a core record of mass integration in virtual worlds and online toys . &quot;
and this from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me , i develop play , i &apos;m a little bit more porky .
so , so he says , it really makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life .
they can make more social directives than in real life -- you get more feedback and reward in games than in the real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that the player is more time in the virtual world than in the real .
i &apos;m just agree with , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
we need to start transforming the physical world into a game .
my inspiration comes back by an event that &apos;s back 2,500 years ago .
there &apos;s these ancient sizes out of sheep , you know ?
before these fantastic games , they stole sheep .
and these were the first of people developed toys .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek greek antheootus , you might know this story . the story about how and why play is invented .
according to theootakus , games became a serious griddler in the kingdom of famine .
well , what had such great famine , the king of lyonman decided to be a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extraordinary situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the herandic otus , the box game , and they wrote a national strategy , and they would eat a day . the next day you would play .
and they would be able to get so much in the field of the field , where games are so fascinating , and with us conflicted , happier productivity surrounded that they would forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day , you would eat food .
and according to viviotus , they were living so 18 years old , and they were born in a day and playing the next .
just like , i think we &apos;re going to play a play today .
we &apos;re play games to escape the real world suffering .
we &apos;re playing games play in order primarily that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially that &apos;s not satisfying in the real life , and we &apos;ll bring us what we need to play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to odorotus didn &apos;t get the famine for 18 years , so the king decided to be a final craft .
they divided the uk two .
they were playing a bile-play , and the apartheid had allowed to break into an epic adventure .
they were leaving lyonas and went to the search for a new home , and they just let them go back so many people who were eating food for surviving and looking at the rest of a neighborhood that they could flourish .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence shows is that the right is the &quot; usists , the later who taught the roman empire , the same dna as the old anlycles .
so scientists recently come to the idea that ancient ototus is actually true .
and geologists found a global temperature that took almost 20 years to explain the famine .
so this crazy story might be true .
maybe they were actually saved their people by play , by putting 18 years in games , and then they had the environment , and then learned so much about it , so that they saved all the civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 .
this was the first strategy in real time world of warduct . that was 16 years ago .
they were born in 18 years for labor , we &apos;ve been doing warcraft for 16 years .
i say , we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half their civilization , looking for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion hours per week .
we should redesign it that the half of us spend an hour a day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problem of the physical world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask questions , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that question i &apos;ve devoted my work on the future for the last few years .
we have this client in our office in palo alto , it suggests how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to introduce the best best outcome , and then we make people to make this idea into reality .
we &apos;re we asking ourselves in the victories and giving people the opportunities to reach them .
so i &apos;m going to show you briefly three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and get people in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to get out of oil scarcity .
oil kscarcity is invented , but we have enough online content , so it &apos;s realistic for them , and you can see your real lives without oil , if you know , when they &apos;re living , and then they get news films in real time , whether care of food , whether they &apos;re closed care , and they need to figure out their real life , and we need to figure out how to do ,
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve taken it since over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
no one wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epish adventures and said , &quot; we &apos;re out of oil . &quot;
that &apos;s an amazing adventure to go to .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have to keep the authority in the game pool .
so for the next world , we have added a bigger face , bigger target , which is just called oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superinstruments &quot; at the institute for the future .
so what happens is the computation of a supercomputer , that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global conmortal systems : &quot; of course , of course .
the call of the player , to sign on , we &apos;ve made almost like a jerry-flusty .
you know , jerry &apos;s wecknest characters , where there &apos;s the astronauts . you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-maker ring , and only together you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , each one is at the vam-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , politics , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read for , if they &apos;re tonstruct .
and the last game we bring at march 3nd : it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you &apos;ll get the world bank award by the global accounting , trending 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in a total sub-saharan africa , and i invite you to learn social retrochange .
we have a comic book about it . we have &quot; level high for local , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to share all of you to share this game with young people , everywhere in the world , especially in development areas that benefit them to imagine their own social enterprise to save the world .
so i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
so , what do you think happens next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use for work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we &apos;ve we have all these super forces , happy productivity , the ability to create tight social networks , require optimism bias and desire to lie .
i really hope that we &apos;re going to play significant games to survive on this planet around the planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me this .
when i look forward to the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two ways , that we can create an conceivable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s changing games !
thank you .
so , i &apos;d like to tell you something that a couple of months ago , i &apos;ve seen an article for an article for a turnwired article .
i always wrote my synonyn dictionary , but i &apos;ve been ready with the interconnection , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been beaten in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled . &quot;
i &apos;ll read you the post .
disabled , adalust , helpless , useless , destroyed , abplenished , abired , abplenished , abplenished , abpotent , ominous , abpotent , convamt , conductive , he passed away from the traffic , he passed up , he lived , he ate , meaning , damage , meaning , no , useless and weak and weak .
antonyme : healthy , strong , sustainable .
i read this list of a friend of mine loud , and he had to laugh , and it seemed like ridiculous , but i was only going to talk and couldn &apos;t talk , and i had to stop reading , and i had to get together and get me on top of these vectors , connection .
of course , the beloved , old synonyist dictionary , i just thought that was going to be quite old .
but in fact , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s , when i started working with elementary school , and i began to build my self-portrait of my family to build and form , in relation to other children and around the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i haven &apos;t used an synony-dictionary then .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that teaches me as a person who could perceive their lives in any way of nothing positive , but today , i &apos;ll be celebrated for opportunities and adventure .
so i immediately put up the online copy of 2009 , and i expected that to be an antagonists of the contribution here .
so here &apos;s the state-of-the-art version of this .
it &apos;s a lot of time , not much better .
especially , particularly the last two words , the last two words , under near antony , &quot; completely &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we &apos;re thinking about the people we describe to these words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we build these values .
our language is affecting our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of ancient societies , including the greeks and the romanmer , have really believed that the excise language has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about is looking at it .
so , what do we want to see is the evidence of a disability or a force people ?
already , for example , to be eight , if you call a child , you might remove it , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re overloaded them .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open your door ?
a human being opened for me for my door , my pediatrician at the a.com dupont institute in wilmington in dolphin .
it &apos;s called dr. pizere condom . a italo-american , whose name you could think about , most americans cannot speak correctly correctly , so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always flying very colorful , and it was just created for kids .
i found myself that i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my physics therapy .
i had to develop a bunch of times , infinite times with these thick , elastie bchanges -- in different colors -- that you know , i hate my leg muscles more than anything else , i hated it . i hated .
and imagine , i even had a five-year-old girl with dr. p. , and it was trying to stop this practice , natural luck .
and he was watching me at one of my practice , this exercise was just tiring and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one day of one of those tapes .
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , of course , it was just a simple trick from dr. p. , so that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that i didn &apos;t get to see the richest five-year-old girl in the hospital . but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes , and so it became a new and promising experience .
and i asked myself today how much his vision of me as strong and power young girls built my self-image , and i could imagine , as one of nature from powerful and breathing female person .
this is just one example of a lot of how adults can make the imagination of a child .
but , as examples of the evolution of synonyn dictionaries prove , our language doesn &apos;t make any room to imagine what we would all want to wish : to see each individual , to see himself as powerful people .
our language unleashes of the social changes that have been triggered in many cases by technological change .
and of course of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , in the medical standpoint , of course , you can tell me that my legs , the laser prize for detecting tunes from titanency from titanium for ancient bodies for ancient bodies , to use people to really enable people to natural networking platforms , to develop their own people , at their own than
so , perhaps this technological change is clear , because the fact that it &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human society can have something special and powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , is our biggest plus .
the human ability -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me about me , as i walk with widrities and i &apos;m going to tell you something : that sentence for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with people to answer people , and i believe i understand why .
this is this sentence from dealing with a wisteature of the idea that success or happiness depends on , a challenge to master , to become a challenge , without being fulfilled , because i could be so successful because i could be able to collapse of an prosthetic , or how people with my disability .
but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course , we are shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally or even both of them .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
widities are no obstacle that we need to conserve towards the curves to get our lives .
it &apos;s dities to our lives .
and i tend to see widrities as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he , i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes it hasn &apos;t easy to see , but it &apos;s always in me .
and i want to be taking the impact , or for the heavy of the fight for human beings .
there &apos;s there in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just intimately in real , and every person is going to be different , but the question is not whether or not come out with widridities or not , but how we get out of that .
so we &apos;re not only just responsible for it , the people we love to love to save the audacity , but also ready to get so clear .
and we didn &apos;t know our children , if we give them feel , they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things out : to one of the medical fact , to be a poster , and to the other people who think that i am impaired or not .
and to be honest , the only real and weunt disability that i have to face is that the world is always alive , and you could describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are at the heart and to tell you the cold , hard truth about their medical projections or even an animated to the quality of life that they , we must be careful that we don &apos;t have to pay attention to someone who somebody is impaired .
maybe the concept of course , is the present concept , which is just paying attention to what it is in a broken broken , and how we fix it for every single individual a bigger disability than the pathology .
if we don &apos;t treat a human cian , and don &apos;t recognize all its powers and options , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you might need to lead , one more disease .
we &apos;ve planted one person who has value to our society .
so we have to look at the patology and the focus of the human possibilities .
the most importantly , though , it &apos;s between perception of our disagreement and our great experience , there is a connection .
we should not be able to deny that challenging times or disrupt , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid it under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing the widridities opportunity .
it might be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t have to overcome , but that we &apos;re open to tackle it , the poor , you know , to use of course , you know , to use the shopf , to be able to use a lottery expression .
and maybe we create it , wisteties than something natural and perceiving and useful and feeling that by their presence , it doesn &apos;t be so profitable .
in this year we celebrate the 200 , and the last birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , darwin , in my eyes , to something very true in human nature .
i would write it be that : not the most powerful of its species survives , and also not the most intelligent of its way , but the change that can adapt to change the best .
there is a conflicts .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive , to thrive , is driven by the struggle of the human mind is to transform themselves to transform conflicts .
so again , change and adaptability are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what we know is we &apos;ve been cutting out of the wood when we really get tested .
perhaps , in fact that the sense of widrities , a perception of which is a feeling for our own force .
we can give ourselves a little bit .
we can make a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see widities as change .
we have a change for a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
am it honest -- who &apos;s normal ?
there is no ordinary .
there are the usual . that &apos;s the typical thing . but not the normal one , and would you want to learn these arms , gray person , if you &apos;ve really ?
i think , i don &apos;t .
it would be great if we think of this paradigm of normality against a different possibility , or the strength , to make it even a little bit more dangerous to engineer , and then we can unleash the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
it &apos;s ilhergene sacks have found that we have always given people from the participants of our society , to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals that neanderthals 60,000 years ago , older people and people have carried with severe physical injuries , and that may have happened because the life experience in survival in the battle of the society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the town that i grew up into a food market in the red zone in the boston zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a flexible el tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had taken in .
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , don &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s .
and of course , then it &apos;s got a click .
this was dr. keam , a man i knew from my mother &apos;s stories about this day , because of course , in my birthday to my birthday .
the doctor for prenatese mandk was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born with no legs , and my feet turned to them , and i just had a couple of my toes on this and a couple of toes on the other leg was the hyber , which had to spread the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never want to walk , and never move away like other children , like other children , or not having never ever an independent life , and they &apos;ve just been lying me . &quot;
actually , i found him was that he was collected the newspaper reports of my entire total childhood , no matter whether i had won at a passionate contest in the second grade , whether i had the obstacles , or one of my athletic victories , and he uses these programs to teach his students , medical students from the hazed medical school .
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can just can &apos;t emphasize enough as the importance of this factor for quality of life &apos;s quality of life .
and dr. keat once said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if you &apos;re not going to get something else , and you can only get a bit of a little bit , if you &apos;re going to get kids around yourself , then kids can achieve very much . &quot;
you see , dr. clubs has changed his thinking .
he understood that he understood that the medical diagnosis , and the way someone could deal with it is two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking of time , if they asked me in the age of 15 years , whether i had had my prostheses against air and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second .
i really , i was doing normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , not despite that experience .
and maybe this transition could happen to happen , because i am seeing so many people who have opened my doors , rather than seeing people who stopped me or want to have a hint of me .
you see , it takes only one person to tell you how to manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow it to someone , your own , internal forces , the human mind is so comfortable -- if you create that , and for somebody in a critical moment open a door , they &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they bring them to open up their neighbors .
the importance the meaning of the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; in the word &quot; the word &quot; &quot;
it means that means something that &apos;s inside is the potential out of tickle .
so , what are the potential would we want to call ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , we were doing a case of case in the united states , in the time , publishing asia in total schools .
they call this the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students are separated by grades .
and the a student gets harder harder , and they get better teachers and so on .
they then had over a three-month period of students with a three-month period , and they said they were very good , they were told them they were very clever , and after the three months they were smart .
and of course , it cracks to hear a heart that is inverted to students , they &apos;re just sufficient .
and the three months was now , too .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had their school .
the key to the study was that the teachers were not biased .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that are the one-student student , and that &apos;s how the students are enough and they have to teach them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which is broken , doesn &apos;t have any hope anymore . it finds more beautiful . it &apos;s missing our natural intellectual interest , and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we manage it to support the human spirit in the process , to hope itself and other people around themselves to be beautiful , and we have to be very curious and then forronizing our powers .
if a mind has a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new generosity .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persifiz called hafiz in the 14th century , and my friend of bois told me , and the god is called the god who knows four words , not the god of the name , but the god who knows four words , but the god that seems like four words , but only the only says , he says , come on
come on dance . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
assuming , i said that with a few changes of their genes , one might have a better memory -- more , more , more , more and faster .
or you want to be more hard , stronger , more force .
would you like to be more attractive and more confident ?
what would it be to live for good health ?
or maybe one of them are always tainted with more creativity .
which would you like that ?
what would you like to want to have to , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably more like there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose a good memory ?
a few more .
what about employment ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the number i like to see as a doctor .
if you could have one of these , it would be a whole different world .
is it all all sorts of education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been ongoing conversation in the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s point .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , star pobzma sky , who was also a communist poet in russian orthodoxen church , once wrote an insentence , &quot; none of biology , &quot; no sense in biology , except in the sound of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re in one of those who are not accepting the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to the audio machine , and i &apos;ll give your personal communications -- and maybe you can still get a glimpse of kathryn schultz &apos;s book , which is it &apos;s going to be about it in the more sense of this speech is going to make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about that , it &apos;s just about the past , or is it also about the future ?
is it for other people , or is it about us ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of interdependence , because if you look at the margins of the tree of the tree of life , all the parts of these branches have been successful in evolutionary terms : they survived : they survive ; it survive ; it shows its environment and strength .
the human part of this book , far at the end , is , of course , is what we &apos;re interested in .
we have two years of modern ancestors to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period period , maybe maybe 20 or 25 different kinds of hominids .
some are gone .
we &apos;ve been here for about 35 years .
it seems like we &apos;re a smooth of the other parts of the building life , but actually the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite equal .
is you clear that we can take advantage of it , and you can see the mechanisms of a common bacteria , and then you can produce by the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat the diabegers ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically inproportionate diversity from what comes out of the panse .
and while we talk about bacteria , are you aware that each of us in our gut is more bacteria in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think , if antonio damasio is asking for your self-picture , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful performing environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to get all nutrients on them , and you couldn &apos;t provide any effort on their own .
it &apos;s really a bit easier way for bacteria with occasional complexities of unintended , spouse , forced defeating .
but otherwise , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help use the digestive of essential , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
are we in a sort of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we to become something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s go back to the time of the lhc for 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- maybe three to four billion organisms on earth -- the first majority of species , three to four billion organisms in the planet -- the first of the first several million organisms , maybe as much than 80 years -- and then the human species , the human
in this enormous epic tower of the universe , life on earth is only very short ; the animal kingdom , the reality of a single stroke , and human life , a small property .
this is us .
now , this is the entertainment issue of this talk , so i hope , d maids .
now , when i was a nevering at college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the counter and beauty of biology .
and i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i hired something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue in both in two thousand cells .
but at the time , as multiple organisms emerged , things began to change things .
it &apos;s a picture of sexual reproduction .
and really important : with the precursor of sexual reproduction , which is dependent on the genome , the rest of the body is essential .
in fact , you could say that the inevitable ability of death in our bodies is going to happen in evolution as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , well , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable to the time , but by every year , came to my own experience .
i came to see the feelings of george burns , which in las vegas , he read his show in the 1990s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel room door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , a beautiful shitdeed artist .
she looks at him , and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the conclusion as a doctor , that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflictive , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to make the health for a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the continuing of the genome to the next generation , adaptability and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , it &apos;s like , and i develop the dawn rockets to send the genetic action into the next stage of orbit in order to drop into the sea .
i think we would all be able to understand the irdy books of all the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get through my work .
i want to reach it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t inevitably affect the biggest , the most common or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution informed evolution is affecting the creatures that relate to their environment .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are therophil , and by doing the hot steam for otherwise , if fish were there , there , there would be a vacuum fish for a series of times , yet they make it managed to make a habitable environments .
so , what does , if we look at this , as we look at what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and particularly as we consider the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we have reached a physical balance .
and the reason that would have is , first of medicine , it &apos;s been able to get a lot of genes that would have been chosen and removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a speculia , so we &apos;ve made our environment so versatile , that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to ourselves exactly , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander , and we mix up and mix it so much that they can &apos;t tell longer that isolation is necessary for the evolution to find locally .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be an evolution of traditional art , of course , judging by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution slow down , but they &apos;re unsafe .
and so far as though , if we colonize as a species of distant planets , it will provide insulation and the changes of the environment that might produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third option , a very tempted , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just of course , but led to us , and we decided , as an individual that we do .
so how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s what we &apos;re the reality of the people today in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family will decide .
so , think , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of their own child , but also to use genetic adaptation , healing and prevent .
what if you could make the genetic changes , to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or to eliminate it reduce rates of cancer or command ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make it to make these changes in their genes ?
when we look forward , these kinds of changes are becoming increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
the following year when it was done in 2004 , they were able to do the same thing for 20 million dollars to four months .
today , you can see a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 , and in the room of about one week .
it won &apos;t take more long until the reality is that there will be the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it &apos;s increasingly going to be available for everybody .
in front of a week ago , the national academy of engineering and wil-for-francis arnold , wilsty steuss , two scientists who were inspired by improving the natural process of improving the natural process of evolution , working faster and desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- which frances arnold is &quot; honevolution evolution .
a few years ago , the laser price of the scientist shinya yamanaka study took his research in which he took an adult skin , fibroblasts , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell conducctive from an agent of a stem stem cells -- a cell potential to become a cell to be any cell in your body .
these changes are in coming .
the same technology that produces the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection before itself , but also immune to the genetic viruses .
whether it doesn &apos;t believe or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang of vaccine against influenza , which was built in the cells of tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good out of tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and the future is going to be possible .
so think about two other small changes then .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in their tracks ?
what if they could change the sperm and iron cells or they could change the cracks to provide their kids a better chance for a healthier person -- eliminating the risk of diabetes , the heopopene , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be a healthier child ?
and then the analytic technique , the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , could enable us to enable super-potent super-abilities , hyper-capacity -- the better memory .
why did not have the outrage of a ken jennings , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the watha machine ?
why don &apos;t have fast muscle fiber that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
they &apos;re going to be undisgusting .
and if we &apos;re at one place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can have the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by the alcentric style evolution to the evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires us 100,000 years , and we can compress it in a thousand years , and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be done .
are we using a society to form a society that &apos;s better , the more successful that &apos;s friendly ?
or are we going to be selective disparate , who we want for some of us , not for other of us ?
are we going to become a society of farming is more productive and unified , or robust and low-cost and more potent ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to look at .
and the deepest of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make in order to make these decisions ?
in good terms of evil , and sooner as you might think , these decisions will be about us .
thank you .
so i want you to think of it now , a tragic robot that gives you a human skills , or another , your wheelchair , to get up and go back .
we at berkeley bionics , we call these robots inskeletons .
they &apos;re not different as something that you put up in the morning , and that gives you extra strength and it &apos;s going to continue to increase their velocity and help their balance .
this is indeed the true emanating of human and machine .
but not only that -- to merge , and connect with the universe and other accidents out there .
this isn &apos;t just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers who wore average of about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s asking that they should carry more gear .
of course , this leads to some major complication -- spinal cord injury , 30 percent of it -- chronic spinal cord injuries .
so we thought we were that we would take this challenge and create an exotic skeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me show you to the hulc -- or the human universal , top-down prorier .
soldier : with the hulc exotic , i can carry 200 pounds of different continents for many hours .
the flexible design enables it allows it to be deep down deep , to be able to get rid and highly consistent movement .
it feels that i want to do where i want to go and grow my strength and all over .
we &apos;re far to imagine with our industrial partner of this device , this new average skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s going to run our view on the wheelle driver , something that i &apos;m in particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people sitting in the world in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the total population .
and this is indeed an conservative estimate .
we &apos;ve been talking about very young people here with spinal cord injury , which is in their waters of their lives -- in &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 60s , 23 -- the wheelchair and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , the number of times .
and so pretty much as the only option -- if it comes to a brain , it &apos;s a wheelchair -- it &apos;s a wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been around for 500 years since it has been , in the way , i have to say very successful .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
so let me to imagine elegang , which is used by amanda boxum , who suffered a spinal cord injury , which has been that she could not walk for 19 years , until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda wearing our elegangs .
it has sensors .
its fully his non-invasive sensors in the crutches , sending back to our onuc-computer computer that &apos;s attached to you on your back .
here &apos;s a battery-pack packaging , the engine is rotating on its knees , and so like their carddler , which you move forward into this very rough and very natural cab species .
i was 24 years old , and i was in the shape as a monbal tree , while a ski ride asleep .
in a fraction of a second , every feeling , every movement underneath my sebasin .
not long after a while , a doctor sitting in my hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never get back . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
so , he ate each five minutes of hope from my consciousness .
adaptability of adaptile technologies since i &apos;ve been able to learn to ride again and climb and even drive with the hands .
but nothing was invented that would leave me again until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential potential to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldier , or amanda here , and all of the wheelers , for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a director of prototype organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t care of poverty , i &apos;m fighting as a fireman &apos;s product in a volunteer lion wearing the fire .
now , in our town where volunteers sponsored a high-qualified professional defense , you have to be pretty early at branding to train .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer to the branding , so i was a pretty good opportunity to put in .
but it was still a condition for the other volunteers to reach the people who were going to do and figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the chief man , he just had a very serious conversation with the domestic service , which certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and they stood up in the dork train and bark under a screen outside the stream , while their house was in fire .
the other volunteers that was done in front of me -- we call him lex -- the main man as first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the home .
the dog ! i was a choreographer .
there was any lawyer , a wealth path , which is now for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he went into a burning of the house to save a living creature , except because he was faster than five seconds faster than me .
well i was next .
the main man beats to me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
you &apos;ve got to go up to the fire , and bring you a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i was hoping , but i went down -- the trems , the flur , on the real firemen who were out of this point of the right whale , which was so pretty much done into the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i am not a hero .
i wore my prey back down where i met my door to my erenemy and the beloved dog .
we got our guesses out of the outside , where , not surprisingly , got a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the fire guard received a letter of the house in which they were able to put herself for the taddle program at the rescue of rescue .
one thing that was primarily conducted was a little bit of devastating kindness : someone even brought her even a few shoes .
in my profession at robin hood , as well as a volunteer fireman , i am witness of generosity and kindness in a large scale , but i &apos;m also seeing the interest of interest , love , and the aftert .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i look around this room and people see people who can either have been there , or on their way , i want to offer out at the following .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in a different life until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give , it &apos;ll give it right now .
if you have a company in a soup , rooms in your neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save a human life , but every day offers us to change one .
so watch ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the continuation of humanity .
a place where women lead the statistical lead , &quot; hello &quot; hi &quot; hi , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not about you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world &apos;s wild bonobos in the old-forest of congo .
bonobos are together , bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living lives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their generosity .
but unfortunately , we have emphasized this aspect into the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the memes .
as a lot of people from great , frightening bribs is led to the female community of empowerment female .
they &apos;ve actually come up there , because this leads to a very severe tolerant society , which has not been observed in deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under the primates .
they live into the depths of the congolese urinders , and they &apos;re just very hard to observe .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the hub of a violent argument that has been holled to decades and naughty as many lives as world war ii .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that those destruction also survive the survival of the bonobos .
meat and the collapse of the trees are going to take it that you couldn &apos;t have a stadium with the killing bonobos -- and even there we aren &apos;t safe to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a ridiculous laugh that the trees galvanized .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have commongene , even excessive sex , with interacting partners , and rules so conflicts and social qualities .
now i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the population is more than the cama sutra .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children .
for us and it &apos;s a play for the engagement of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity for diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human latitude , dance and rituals .
play is the tickle holding us up .
now , i don &apos;t know how you &apos;re playing , but i want to show you a few unique footage out of the wild .
first of all , a balloon plays for epilepsy -- and i don &apos;t think about soccer ball .
so here is a young female and male in a chase player .
look at what she does .
that could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; you pack it at the eggs . &quot;
except i think it &apos;s more likely , not true .
yeah .
so sexual games are common , both the bonobos , too .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the technological wealth that you get new elements into the game -- like the testicles -- and also , how the game is both confidence -- while it doesn &apos;t having tremendous fun at the same time .
but the game is a formal agent .
a game is a formal , and it can adopt many forms of which some of them are quiet , arrogant , curious -- maybe to discover the amazness again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think , just as you &apos;re playing sometimes , sometimes we play each other , and we &apos;re falling away from the inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected connections that we build are the true nutrients of creativity .
so this is just a taste of insight , the bonobos giving us to our past and present .
but it also also a secret to our future , a future that we have to adapt to the transformational challenges , through bigger creativity and robotic cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the keys is to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptive joker .
in order to adapt successful world , we need to play .
but will we make the best way to do from our toy ?
play is not silly .
it certainly .
for bonobos and , for other people , life is not available from teeth and claws alone .
and just if it doesn &apos;t seem to look at play , it might be game .
and so my classic mate , let &apos;s leave this gift of the evolution of evolution and together while we discover the creativity of the camera and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , right at exactly the same time , every one is a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each one is a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time to imagine , because , if you think about the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the bullet is a y chomoan piece that hits the x chromosome of the egg cell .
and in the other case , the number is a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the ice cell .
both of them are allies , both fire .
and we come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hats .
under a hat i &apos;m interested in with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m an undercover historian , historian , and in this case i study how people were doing anatomy -- the human body , animal bodies -- how they went with body fluids , with the physical level , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i &apos;ve carried in with my work is the activist , as a patient in lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , are an impatient lawyer -- of people who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have the body types , asking social norms in question .
so for example , i worked with people who are siamesian twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with zwarf grew -- so people who were smaller than conventional people .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexual people whose gender is atilic -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and generally , we can we use the word of well-being .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of the potential types of gender that &apos;s not the male or female standards .
in a case , you might have someone with a mini chromosome base , and sry &apos;s tail chomock is going to provide the seed tag that we &apos;ve all got used to testicles .
and that &apos;s why the testates in the coping levels of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptor to detect the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called androgenaling belts .
so much testosterone , no reaction for that .
as a result , the body evolves more to the typical female path .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s trained as girls .
but it &apos;s usually until they reached puberty , and they grow their breasts and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until somebody comes out there .
and you make a couple of tests , and find out , rather than being ogs and the uterle , in reality , in reality , and that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of that person for the male , but they &apos;re not really .
women like men , have something in our bodies that they call adrenalinscopes .
it &apos;s in the back part of our body .
and the side of these kidneys make androgens , which are vital hormones .
most of course , most women , like me -- i believe a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome , but i think that i probably have the typical -- most talking about androgens .
we create androgens , and we &apos;re talking about androgens .
the consequence is that somebody like i actually have a brain is that more androgens , when a woman who was born with testicles , and a androgenaling recepaling .
so , gender sex is really complicated ; conventional sexual ones are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , they can be spread over the whole range .
another example ago : a couple of years ago , i received the call a 19 year-old man who was born as a young boy , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had figured out that he had a flaver and a uterer .
he had an extraordinary head of an innate mancatdenic beach .
he &apos;s got xx chromosome , and in the womb , his chief owner were so active that they essentially created a black surround .
and as a consequence , his genal-men in italy were changed , his brain was exposed to the most abundant male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody liked something .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was in the menstock that the doctors realize that he was in the inner capacity .
okay , just a quick example of intersexuality .
some people with xx chromosomes develop something called the oabfish , where ovariis is called ovarial tissue , with ovarids .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
so , gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it grew up or siamesian twins , it &apos;s more interesting -- that surgeons are adapted to the norm , is not because that would be their physical for their physical health .
in many cases , people are totally healthy .
and the reason why is why many species of surgical interventions is , because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical is related to certain identity .
so what we have is the concept of being a woman is being a female identity , which is to be a black person , is supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of your history .
so we have this horrifying idea .
and if we are confronted with a body , for us , for us , we have something very different for us , and we put it in terms of these categoricies .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation actually based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can you imagine how amazing it is when children are born , the two people are in a body .
where recently , in the last time , had seen the most exciting time , the south bronx troster sester semenya last year , whose gender was asked by the pediatrician palestinian championship in berlin .
a lot of journalists were calling me the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who tells us whether if caster semenya &apos;s mortal or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that it didn &apos;t exist .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature is not going to attract us between men and poor , or gender and more expensive , touch , we &apos;re not paying attention to us , of course , that separation .
so we &apos;ve got a situation like this , where , the continued of our science , we need to think about it , that these categories that we were given for severe anatomic categories , which are very simple to create permanent justice deatatminority , lots of skatoriums than , a lot .
and that &apos;s not only about gender equality .
it also applies also in terms of race , which it turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology would be .
and in all of view , in our way , we came into all sorts of acceptable spaces .
so , for example , for the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we should start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from a few nuclear spacing ?
as we move our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly entering a domain of comfort , where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories we had probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of human life .
one of the areas that we see for the board , in our culture today , in the united states , is the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
we have a difficult conversation about what &apos;s going to become a body for people , so that he has a different right than the adult life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- not as public as in medicine -- about the question that somebody is dead .
our ancestors had never had the hard question of fighting when someone was dead .
you have someone who cleaned up to a feather , and if you moved around , you haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if they were not moved anymore , it has buried it .
but today , we are in a situation where we take people to take vital organs and we want to have other people to breed .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to catch ourselves in the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really hard situation where we don &apos;t have simple categories such .
now you assume that might assume that the entire collapse of atoms would make me feel happy .
i &apos;m politically , politically , disabled , defending people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories really are much more insecure than we thought , seemingly excited .
and it makes me excited about thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to really know that i am a big fan of green fathers .
i know that know that ravalued , i know they were sexists , but they were great .
i think they were so tailed and strong , and radically , in which what they were doing for all the years that i &apos;m going to mal-to-sleep in 1719 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is completely forgotten .
it &apos;s about what &apos;s happened in 1776 .
the green fathers were in my view were the original anatomic activist , so that was why .
what they were published was an anatomical concept , and they put it through another , which was radically different and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember , our greener brothers were the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy took on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the first of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the perception that idea that people who had political power had to have this political power , because of the shock of blood , on the father , to the father and so on .
the green fathers meadows this idea , and they put it through a new anatomic concept , and this concept said that all humans were being created equally .
it was a macro , she decided that anatomically , anatomically , the differences , not the differences , and it was very radical .
now , they made that part , because they were part of an educational system that grew up together .
democracy was growing up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the history of the green fathers , that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world .
they went away from the natural supernatural way , and meadows things , like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission on a very vap is based on birth of birth .
they were moving into a natural concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they talk about nature to tell us who we are .
and in part of that , we managed to make us an idea that was universally common .
and so they have a wonderful to the future of future rights movement .
they weren &apos;t thinking about it was , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after years ?
for example , women who were women who tortured the election &apos;s law , the concept of the green fathers , who says that anatomically wealthy is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; we should have a uterper and protein that we shouldn &apos;t have to be the vote on the right to own the full state of citizen , to own , etc . , etc . , etc . ,
and women argued this successfully .
the next , the successful civil rights movement came out , where we see people like soverer , who spelled over it , &quot; am i no woman ? &quot;
we find men in the march mountain in the hills , saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color , which have mutual common similarities in anatomical differences , again , again , successful .
we see the same thing with the disability movement .
of course , the problem is that , and we &apos;re starting to look at all the commonalities , we need to start thinking about why we sustain certain separate talents .
now , so , as i want to keep living with certain reciprocies , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to get the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-old will have the right thing to make their commitment or to marry .
so there are some anatomic remains that make sense for me , and that we think i should be able to keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep it , and whether you care about it .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that have been shown to the beginning of the speech .
we &apos;ve got two creatures , both the middle of 1979 , that &apos;s the same day .
suppose one of one of you , maria , three months old astonished , so she was born at the one june of 1980 .
the heinrich , on the other hand , is born to the &apos; 50s , so he was born at the third march of 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born early three months old , they were going to get all sorts of rights three months before henry -- to have the right to vote in listening to drink the right .
the heinrich has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological biological age , except by the time of birth .
we &apos;re still finding other more strange things about what their rights are .
henry , because it takes male &apos;s -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s at the cutting -- because you just think that he &apos;s male , he can now be drawn to what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
now , maria , no one , can &apos;t perceive the same right , the heinest in all states in all states , and to marry that right .
heinrich can marry a woman but maria can &apos;t marry a woman today in a few states today .
so we have these permanent anatomic categories that are in many ways of challenging and fragments .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is going to make progress like this in the field of anatomy , that we have to get a point where we need to admit that a democracy that is based on anatomy , could it ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , it also feels like science itself is going overhead .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a more pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll move it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people went into a very strange position .
so for example , texas , at a point decided to marry a man that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and he said to marry a woman that &apos;s a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested for their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very strange , because of the story that i started with at the beginning of the androgenaling controller .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his , &quot; i have a dream of a solution .
he says we should not be doing people , &quot; their skin color , but after the quality of your character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their characters ?
and i want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be so sure we &apos;re going to people in relation to people , because i have to say that i am a series of golden retrieverever know who are likely to make a likely to make social than some people i know .
i want to predict that , i probably know a couple of light gardens dogs , the more serious , more serious , more intelligent and raising decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40 of years i know .
so how should we address the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be difficult .
and part of me wondering what if the content could be something that could be something that could be a player , that would be made in the future machine -- using an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go in this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where to go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is challenging question of making democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing properly , and i think we &apos;d be good things in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like it is in iran , where a man who feel sexually fought to other men , being punished with death , because he &apos;s ready to be ready for gender equality in which he may remain alive .
i don &apos;t have the conditions of that kind of state .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon who spoke a few years ago that brought a couple of siamese twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i hired him with him , and he asked him why he did this surgeries -- there were high operations -- his response to his country , these country , these children would be treated badly , and so he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot; well , you know , &quot; well , do a political asco is going to take an opinion of a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states is offering incredible opportunities to allow people to be , without that they &apos;re changing around the hive .
that &apos;s why i think we &apos;re going to be leading .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of thinking about democracy , or looked at how we had mothers involved more .
and i want to say something that is a feminist piece of something radical , and i think there could be different kinds of insights that govern from different kinds of information that are anatomy , especially when people think of group thinking .
since years , because i was interested in intersexuality , i &apos;ve been interested in education in gender equality .
and one of the things that i learned really interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , in the average -- not any , but at the average , is more complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable within the group of vulnerable , very much attention .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation before us .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my graduate advisism , who knew my interest in feminism -- i considered myself a feminist , really .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
the feminism , it &apos;s about blunt about gender , so that feminism is not female .
but the more i was thinking about his question , the more i thought it could be something female in feminism .
this is to say that there might be something , in the average , which is the female brains of male matter to make us feedback for highly complex social relations , and more accurate for the protective needs .
so , where the green fathers were extremely noble to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it can be possible if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more likely to protect , not just how to protect it , but how we care for each other .
and maybe it is where we need to go into the future if we take democracy from anatomy -- less than thinking about the individual body , to think about identity and thinking more about connection .
so , if we &apos;re trying to do a people trying to make a perfect connection , we think about what can we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public table , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to love it , with every chance of finding another colorful , nament outfit , and i &apos;ve got to photograph in the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all get my clothes out of a second hand , and i get floating in their skin .
ooh , thank you .
it allows the way that i call the state of their bones allows me to reduce the impact of my garage to the environment , and also that on my purse .
i meet all sorts of great people , for example , for example , in addition to a good achievement ; i look pretty unique , and it &apos;s making my own personal backbone .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers yes yes , i feel like if i won .
so i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i put on for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what do you do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very precisely what i brought with .
i brought out with seven pieces of underwear , and that &apos;s all .
casual pants for exactly one week are all that i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
and i got a gun all the things i wanted to wear is if i was going to get to palm springs .
and since i &apos;m not heard of myself as the woman who &apos;s running around at ted in your underwear , that means i &apos;ve found a couple of things .
and i want to show you my outfits this week .
does that sound ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i think it or not , of these adventures , learned nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the beam tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including it , it took me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried on this whole week .
monday : color is a powerful force .
it &apos;s almost more responsible to be bad judges when you &apos;re wearing the light red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you start to add other happy people .
tuesday : adapt are totally covered .
i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time of my life trying to be myself , and adapt to the same time .
be just who you are .
if you relate to the right people , it will not only understand it , you &apos;re going to estimate it .
wednesday , wednesday : the poor you are in charge .
sometimes , people tell me , i would say , as if i am playing the games or i remember her seven-year-old .
and i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is key .
if you think you see something good in something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just conclude that for a minute .
if you think you &apos;re inside and the outside is a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so , there &apos;s no excuse for anybody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : one universal truth -- five words : golden pailleans adapt to everything .
and finally , saturday : an individual , unique , personal style to develop , is a great way to tell the world more about without saying a word .
it was always been proven to me and over the week that week came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversation .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to separate these things , because the right thing is going to be the right thing , it &apos;s always a different frosts , removing the outfit that i am waiting for me when i love a little hearts and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as an example , as a visual section .
this is what we call in our lab , the perception design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m an ancient italian , and every boy in italy grows to this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something that happened in the past decade .
a couple of time ago , it was that if you wanted a formula a race , they took their money and put her money on your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the rider were good enough , they won the race .
now today , if you want to win a race , that &apos;s actually something like this -- something that drives the car in real time , some thousands of sensors , the information from the information from the data , that information , and then you &apos;re going to bring them back to that car decisions and things in real time .
they would call it in engineering teams , a real-time control control system .
and essentially , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- it &apos;s a conscious part and responding to a conscious .
what &apos;s interesting today is that today is real-time control systems begin to emerge in our lives .
our cities were becoming , for the last few years , now with networks and electronics .
they become a computer in the free .
and as a computer in a free , they start reacting to the other way , and it &apos;s been shaped and driven .
when we measure cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
and by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the global population are living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- output to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so when we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense , pulls into objects of everyday life .
this is from a show called paola antonelli for moma , later in the year during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; iron with me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atoms is out to both , a sensor and a driver is .
and this changes radically the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as miangelo , she formed the moses , he &apos;s like he took his hammer and he threw him on moses and he can still see a little point to see , and said , said , &quot; wore a parry , why don &apos;t you remember ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins to the very first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again with the idea of perceiving our environment .
let &apos;s start with the perception .
so the first project i &apos;d like to imagine is one of the first of our lab .
it was built for four and a half and a half years ago .
and what we did was actually using a new type of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone web , and anonyquisites , and modification of the network that &apos;s going to be collected by the operators as the way the city .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was like italy won the footblind world championship .
some of you will remember it was playing with italy against france , and then at the end , the headpress .
and anyway , italy has won the end .
now , look at what happened on this day , only when the activity is happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the thick , the fluidisters .
on the morning , the game before .
you see the timeline right up .
you know , afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and moving .
the game starts off -- silence .
france is making a gateway . in italy , a gateway .
half time , people make a quick call , go on a toilet .
second half times . end of normal time .
first extension , second .
cidane , in a moment of headshock .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big barrier .
the next day , everybody went to the center of the harbor team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of plato , circo bulley , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the outline at the end of day .
well , this is just one example , as we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t have a few years ago .
just a different examples of feel : this is not about people , but for things that we use and consume .
well , today , we know everything about where we come from .
this is a map that is showing you all of the chips , showing a mac computer how they came together .
but we just know very little about where things go .
so we actually , in this project , we actually designed a couple of little markers to track the waste as it goes through the system .
so we started with a few volunteers who helped us a year ago , more than a year in seattle , set up the things that they throw away -- different kinds of things , as they can see -- things that they might throw away .
then we have the little chip , the little brands , put on the trash , and started tracking it .
so here are the results that we &apos;ve got right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with that information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
we can do the same thing in terms of less energy .
the data had not been available before .
but it &apos;s going to happen a lot of unuseful trucks and more complicated things .
but the other thing about that is that we believe that when we see every day , that &apos;s the cup that we throw out , not simply disappears , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we leave every day will keep there .
and if we show that human beings , we can reach behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf beaderman could still take a lot more about this , and the many other wonderful things you can do with a sense , tell me , but i like to talk to the second part that we published at the beginning and that we &apos;re discussing and that is the environment of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in volagoza , in spain .
and it started with a question of the civil fundamentals of what came to us and said that spain and south is a nice tradition , beautiful tradition , to apply to the public .
and the question was : how could you combine technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that have been tracked with in a labor of labor , was , imagine these thumbones , valves , magnetic valves , the ones that open and close .
they &apos;re going to be causing a water inbreather with an image of water .
if you drop points down , they can write on it , they can put patterns , images , images .
and they can close him up , and it &apos;ll open up to allow them out , so , as you can see on this picture .
well , we presented the mayor .
he was very comfortable .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the expo .
we called it the digital water called pagal lion .
the whole building was out of water .
there are no door or windows , but if you &apos;re just close to it , you will open up and leave it in .
the roofs was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s wanching if you &apos;re going to reduce these syringes , you can even let the ceiling .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this days , if you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building ; it &apos;s just so that the architecture almost disappears .
and you see how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
and what i see here when i tried to test the test of sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all of sensors were listening to .
but in that night , it was a even bigger fun .
all the kids from tenagoza came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make it open , but a building that still had stopped and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we &apos;re always thinking about how people are the people who use things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used to interact and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical image , the imagery of water and the projection .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve got to think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that image of imaging could actually start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter coins that fly through the air , and each of you with a little bit of a visual item with altering light -- almost like a cloud that can move through space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter when you saw earlier that moves with others completely , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
they can have a more flexible screen or display , like these -- horizontal formation in two dimensions .
or unregular , in three dimensions , where that &apos;s what changes light , not the position of the image .
you can play with different kinds of species .
imagine that screen could easily appear in different forms or sizes , different solutions .
but then , the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud out of the visual cloud that you can go to , and they &apos;re moving from many , many directions .
and you see here a real flyfire-controlling control , which is deposited down to shape as well as previously an incredibly potent .
when you turn the light on , it looks like this . so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people being driven .
it could have a pulse of every single image of people coming from people , of the movements of people or something .
and i want to show you first first .
we &apos;ve worked with robert to bolle , one of the best balbrian dancers in our time -- the éashle at new york and the scala in milala -- we recorded his movements in 3d for the fluyfire .
and here you see robert to dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the imagery , the different tutoring sensations .
it &apos;s simultaneously a real-time 3-gram and a movement display .
so you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then once we get all the image points , you can play with it , and play color gravity , gesture .
we want to use that as a momentum for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re starting to engage people to do something and change the environment -- radically changing the environment -- almost as something that we call it to build the cloud as you move , but , but with a cloud .
imagine that anybody can give you a little donation for an image .
and i think that &apos;s the remarkable part of the history of history last years , the last decade , is that we &apos;ve inherited from a physics to a digital world .
that has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it available through the internet .
now , the first time we can do -- and the campaign obamas has shown that -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can do to put up the future challenges -- think about the climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physics .
so the idea is , the idea is , we actually put people into it , in which they &apos;re doing things together , collective .
the cloud is again , and again , a cloud of representation , in the same way , a cloud of protein .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of imagery .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it covers up with imagery .
you can move inside different kinds of experiences .
you can actually see it in the bottom , to share the most important moments of the olympic 2012 of 2012 , and use it as a kind of connection to community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something you can go to see on the top of london &apos;s new mountain summit .
can you walk inside .
and a kind of digital leuchtower in the night -- but more important , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important in the context .
by my work , i strive to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time ago , i was in the antarctic 10 years ago , where i saw my first ice mountains .
my commitment .
my heart raste , my heart was stristy me while i was trying to believe what was going on front of me .
the ice mountains around the water was 60 feet out of the water , and i was only amazed that this was a snowflake on another snake , year around year .
ice mountains are born as a calb of a glacier or by breaking ice sheets .
each iceice has its own individual personality .
they interact with explicit ways with their environment and experience .
some of course , some people would give up and they sit down to the bitter end , whereas others don &apos;t take themselves , and they break down in a recipient passion .
if you look at a ice mountain , you think it &apos;s easy to be isolated , separate and on , just as we humans often see us .
but the truth is far away .
as a ice ice melts , i breathe , on the time of time .
as the ice ice melts oxytocin , mineral drinking water , which feeds many forms .
i go to my photographs of that ice mountains so when i was making portraits of my ancestors , in the conscious mind that they &apos;re in these individual moments of the same way , and never get back in that .
it &apos;s not a death , if it &apos;s melting ; it &apos;s not a end , it &apos;s an ongoing gesture of the cycle of life .
part of the ice in the ice mountains that i photographed is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is to show a ice mountain that i photographed in kekerm in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re going to see a witness of a wheeler iceberg .
here you see here .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg , and where it is on the water line .
you can see here , he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat moves around the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of an ice iceberg .
it &apos;s about 600 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , showing you the ice mountain a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but at the coolest part of what i ever worked , it was about this guy .
his name is shart .
temple was one of the leading graffiti artist in the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walks , and he said , &quot; paps , my legs get upset . &quot;
and this was the savanna accident .
temple is fully paralyzed now paralyzed .
it can only use its eyes .
i was against him .
i have a company that &apos;s design and animation , so clearly is a complex part of what we admire in the art world and we see .
so we decided to support -- curing -- and to support his thing .
i met his father and his father , and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him , and i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about the higher society of society and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
people are not available to these machines . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie the film &quot; dune &quot; and &quot; kerlate ceiling . &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they walk along .
i marveled : &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to make just a check just , and instead , i made a check from which i didn &apos;t know the chief knew how to fix it .
i was a credit for me to celebrate his brother , and his father and father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is to talk about , tony &apos;s going to talk about him , and find a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make him back his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who is wearing it is not going to communicate . &quot;
so i spoke for a few months later at a conference .
and i met these people from atrol , cnn research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every surface , and then draw with a laser beam that is going to the negative surface .
so they go around and make art installations like this .
they say that all the things that will be presented up there , follow a life cycle .
it starts with the sex station , then the scunt words , after the bush &apos;s moving , and finally , people actually make art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and i was eating my wife at night , and we said , &quot; well , well , and we thought , well , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to steer things , then we should find a laser that he could make a laser , that would be awesome .
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of things , and from things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the insurance workers in the doors , and actually have a device that can be able to communicate with -- a stephen hawkh-machine .
that was amazing .
and he &apos;s really beautiful -- i call him yoda because you talk to him , or gets an email , and thinks , &quot; i think , &quot; i am so inconvenient , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we flew seven programmers around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and spoerations have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and that we would come back , and all the pictures on the walls would be banitis .
but for over two weeks , we have programmed , we went to caltech in venice , my children were involved , and we were able to get this one .
it &apos;s called casual writer , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sungover we bought on the ship of venice , some copper wire and some things out of the building market and electronics .
we took a rocky 3-3-camera , and you put them up on an led light , and now we have a device of it , and now we can build it ourselves , we can make the code for free , the software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can make a mobile .
not a hospital either .
and every paralyzed can actually communicate with its eyes or draw them .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all of this retreat from the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming labor , nudelparties and a bust , tony drew tony for seven years .
and that &apos;s a stunning picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks about his life support system .
we &apos;ve suggested his bed so that he can see outside .
we set a projector based against a wall of the parking park .
and he drew back to the first time , sitting in his own family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
so , funnious , we had to break into parking goods , so we also felt like part of the spray scene .
at the end of the end , he gave us an email by the following , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel this , i was punched under water , and i finally pulled someone down , and i pulled up my head so that i can breathe .
isn &apos;t amazing ?
that &apos;s something like our combat !
that keeps us to continue to evolve and continue to continue .
and we need to improve a lot more on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic board right now .
and somebody who has such artistic potential deserve so much more .
so we &apos;re at finding out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since for that time , we have all of the kinds of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a couple of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves to .
it comes all from our own pockets .
so the outsiders were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong frustrated us and then in december , meeting magazine when one of the 50 best innovations of 2010 , which was really cool .
the coolest thing about it -- and it includes the whole circle -- that this summer , when you know , in the lander molanca , in the city of los angeles , a show , it &apos;s called &quot; kind of the streets of the streets . &quot;
and you &apos;re going to be there so pretty much the hardest poets of the streetart scene , bankers , shepard , rey , -- all these guys will be there .
temple will be part of the show of what &apos;s pretty much .
so basically , i think , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this piece , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;d never had anything to do with the general physical technology , but i just captured something and around amazing people , so that we were able to put on the legs together .
and that question should be , every one of you , and at every single day where something noticed something that needs to be done , if not now , when do i ? and if not i do who ?
thank you .
so , i &apos;m writing for children , and probably america &apos;s most common children &apos;s book .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come out like a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but no one ever voted farmer .
today , i want to tell you about circles and disagreements .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find is because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as a revelation .
that &apos;s a picture of a circle .
one of my friends had done it -- richard bolling.
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;d like to share with you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school in waw , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was wandering every week in the drodrodroids of green and blue , with a teacher to rescue my life .
she was saving my life by using me the toilet in the teacher &apos;s room .
they did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it interested in a work of aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a call at the night a call from this teacher , woman amis saying , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned as adults .
you could you come to ohio , and please come together with the man who i know you &apos;ve found it .
and i should say that i have built cancer , and i want you to make a ride .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we were crying , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we were looking around them , and we gave them for them , and we got eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know as adults , i met met , she transformed into a box full ash and became my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of the revelation that i talked about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i made yours .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned here today .
it takes the same -- it would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about us to give these things .
thank you .
think of course , imagine a great explosion , as you &apos;re going to go to 1,000 meters .
think about a airplane full of smoke .
imagine a wave engine , the cracking , shouting , clack , clack , shack , clack , beack , gunack , clack .
that sounds scary .
now , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat at 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplane .
so i looked at it right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been attacking the machine , and we weren &apos;t doing so far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened .
the pilot made the machine from the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns off the power on .
just imagine a soundless airplane .
and then he said three words -- the bad one words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; make it free . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the brodcrew anymore .
i could see it in her eyes , there was crap to end the life .
i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned over this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this lifeplan , we &apos;d like to make these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people that i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to escape , all the experiences that i wanted to do .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad bad . &quot;
because if the wine is there , and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to make a difference in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we failed the george washington bridge , so pretty much about hair -- i thought , &quot; boy , there &apos;s one thing that i really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my failures , i was going to do better in everything that i packaged .
but in my mind , i &apos;ve given my ego room .
and i took the time that i &apos;m wasting useless things for meaningful things , with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and afterwards , when i was thinking about it , i decided to put negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t tattoo two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have some right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned , and in fact , while the inner watch is beginning , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , five , ... &quot; down .
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 pieces , as you know it from a documentary .
as we break down , i had this feeling of people dying , not terribly terrifying .
almost like , we would prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really in a thought , which is i just heard one thing .
i just wish i could grow up my children grow .
so , about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- the first graders , not a lot of artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m asleep , i &apos;m a little kid .
and in the world , everything had a sense for me .
i realized , at the time , by connecting the dots that it was only going to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my single goal in life , a good father .
i was not part of dying in this day .
i got another gift to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call about everybody who &apos;s flying now is : imagine that the same thing is happening on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would they do it to push them up , because they think they would be there forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy ?
and more than anything else , you &apos;re the best parents that you can possibly be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the student computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want to build iran &apos;s bomb .
the most important survey there for the development of nuclear weapons is the ultimate incentives in lebanon .
the gray boxes you see here , these are real-time control systems .
if we have to get the systems of composing , which govern and valves control , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with centrifuge .
these gray boxes go not with windows software ; it &apos;s based on a completely different technology .
but if we manage it to be an effective window virus on a laptop , which is used by a crash engineer , to make this gray box into configurations , then .
and that &apos;s behind pxnet .
so we start with a window of windows .
the benefit in the gray box transsy , damaged the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear energy program -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s a child game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we began to put our research six months ago six months ago , it was completely unknown , what was the purpose of the design .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what we knew about windows -- part of using the drone -- part , made up by tens of thousands of neiloscopes .
and it seemed to seem to have something about these gray boxes , that real-time control systems .
and the gene gave our attention , and we started a network lab -- project that we grew up with an interxnet , and we looked at this built .
and then something weird happened .
so hannah complained like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like the cheese -- sniff , but don &apos;t want him to eat .
this didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a goal attack .
all right on a certain goal .
the drband activation on the gray box , when it &apos;s discovered a special configuration , even though the special framework that it takes to infect on this goal .
and if not , don &apos;t do anything .
so , that &apos;s really struck my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
for example , let &apos;s say , for example , an us-american power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should try to figure out what the goal is .
so we extracted and decompite the attacks -- and found that it &apos;s made in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we realized they noticed that they were very professional , from people who had all the insiders -- they were available from them .
they knew every bits and byses that they had to attack .
it probably knew it even knew the shoe size of the machine operator .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got to admit that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , you let me tell you that data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
so here &apos;s a clip from this attack , code .
here &apos;s talking about here -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks like very much like old-fashioned pollution .
and i want to tell you how we could be able to do from this code .
so after what we were looking for as first as we did , we were making systems -- we know what we know .
and then we were looking for tiques and data structures and tried to bring them into the physical world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could cause or escape .
so to make these theories , we &apos;re going to decide that it &apos;s definitely too high graphic sabototage , it has to be a high-goal goal and very likely it probably is in iran be in iran .
now , in this area there isn &apos;t several thousand goals .
it &apos;s now runs down to the book nuclear power station , and on the urges plant in georgia .
so i said to my assistant to my assistant , &quot; let me take a list of all the experts for centrifuge and power plants from our clinic . &quot;
and i called her , and i call her knowledge to compare her coverage of what we found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital warke with the khmer rouge .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and if you &apos;re manipulating the speed of this roast , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and even even letting it explode .
what we &apos;ve found that the goal of attack was actually , it was starting to make it slowly and uncanny -- obviously in this trial of engineers trying to be able to not be able to be able to get behind it .
the great digital warhead -- we got a glimpse by looking at us very similar data and data structure .
so for example , the number 164 bites out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started working with academic literature to work on how this invisibility in georgia and found out that they &apos;re structured in what &apos;s called a caskaam , and every caskade contains 164 centricentrige .
so that made sense , so it took together .
and it was better .
this centrifuge in iran are formed in 15 attacks .
and guess what we found in the attacks of attacks ?
it &apos;s particularly identical structure .
so again , that really did well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we looked at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , this didn &apos;t just go .
these results were reached several of weeks of hard work .
and often we just run in a dead way to collect .
anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads in reality , and the same target , but of different directions .
the little warke takes over a caskade , and it turns out the rotors and the big warhead pops out with six cass in interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in a large , we &apos;re very hopeful that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s natasha , it &apos;s just natasha .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by toxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- it really blew me out of the pasta .
there &apos;s the gray is the gray box , and you &apos;ll see the centrifuge .
now , what &apos;s doing this thing is that it captures the embodied capacity of sensors -- so for example , from printing sensors and vibration sensors -- and there are legitimacy code , which is still during attack , with false data .
and in fact , in fact , this false data , of course , has taken place from layers .
so it &apos;s exactly the same as in hollywood movies , it &apos;s where the result of the afterginger hunt is feeding the surveillance of surveillance video .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
clearly , this idea here is obviously not just the machine interface in the control room .
in fact , there &apos;s much more complicated and aggressive .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
we need digital security systems , where a human machine can &apos;t respond fast enough enough .
so in a plant power , for example , when the great steam turbine gets too fast , you need to open up lanes in milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so at this is where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re risk , then very bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the machine leader , nor the security system will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and that &apos;s really tell you very important .
think about it . this attack is general .
he has nothing to do in particular terms of centrifuge .
so for example , he would work so well -- in a power station or a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- if the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to use the data on a usbm trick , as we saw it at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm to spread .
you have to spread it out as far as possible .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyberweapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the targeted environments .
we need to confront the consequences and we start getting better for ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , so much of it was reported , people assume that the terrorist lity is the main organization behind .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you want to know this ?
yes . okay .
i think of the popular sad thing , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind is the cyberflu .
there &apos;s one thing and these are the united states -- happiness , for happiness .
because in other words , our problem would be bigger .
thank you mind being attached to a hug . thanks ralph .
i spent the last couple of years involved in situations , usually very difficult and actually dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard hard .
i worked on a coal mining -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been filmed in war , hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , none of the food -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career for terrible situations , and it &apos;s all about trying to study social and interesting things that are compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way that they do fun for the audience .
so when i knew that i would come here to come here to look at a tedtalk , the world of branding and sponsor , i knew i was going to make something else .
some of you might have heard of it , maybe a couple weeks ago , i turned out a post on ebay .
and i sent a couple of facebook news , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to be bathed in the 2007 .
really , some happy people and companies and non-profits , had the most unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never gets to buy the word on the talk , and not a title didn &apos;t have a title yet , and not a lot on what the theme would be .
so what you got was this name here : my tedtalk , my tedtalk , who you didn &apos;t know what was going to be the subject the subject , and the rest of the rest was going to fly around the ear , especially if i was stupid if i was stupid .
but besides it , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people see those tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the leader of labor .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the point right .
now , if you asked me this year ago , i would not have been able to tell you that with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , study the world of marketing , advertising .
now , as i said , over the course of the years , i reached a couple of pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare to prepare me , nothing could be a little bit more difficult , and dangerous to walk in a room into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about product , marketing and advertising , the whole film is being funded by product , marketing and advertising and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is called the &quot; called &quot; the &quot; called &quot; the &quot; premiere . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; was , up until the beginning to the beginning , from the beginning to the end , completely with brands is determined -- from the title of the title of the title , in the
now this is a brand , the tempo marketing stadium , the simple center .
these people are going to be connected to the film forever .
and so the movie is exploring this whole idea -- this is what ? in life , forever ?
i am i am a big person .
that was more appropriate .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to get the brand brand list , but we &apos;re sure we &apos;re going to be able to sell any possible category in the movie .
so maybe we might sell a shoe , and it becomes the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the great one thing that they ever are used from , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is called &quot; the &quot; is &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the most salient &quot; is called &quot; the most favorite , &quot; the most mind-ever &quot; of &quot; the greatest drink they &apos;ve ever used to have , &quot; the &quot; is &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing it from showing that brands are a part of life , really , to bring it to finance the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in film .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , beginning to the beginning .
and i &apos;d like to enjoy if i was going to help build this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i &apos;ve heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how to be the receiver .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because that has a negative connotation -- but you know how do you know how that &apos;s going to develop ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
one million million .
i think it &apos;s hard to make it , but i think it &apos;s worth the value of some really familiar brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a horror dye .
what do you think that &apos;s the answer ?
the answer is probably becoming no .
but is it a hard thing about the film or a hard thing about me ?
jk : both .
and so means , not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
great .
we need to think about what brands are .
yes .
if you look at people who have to do it with ...
there are a couple of places that we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean that we wanted to lead a piece of conversation .
it turns out that it really meant in reality , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with their movie . &quot;
and just so , all of these companies disappeared from the other .
no need to have something to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product as many people could be presenting , many people like possible , so many people think about .
especially in the modern world today , on this interface of new and old media and the creving environment -- it &apos;s not the idea of the new exciting endeavatory instrument that owns the devil of this text .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following .
in fact , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would be okay .
but that &apos;s what this image is , is a problem .
you see , if you look in transparency at your google search , this is one of the first pictures that seems .
i like really , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- from deception and chip , simple to explore , and see it , immediately , meaning from cognition , and access to information , and it &apos;s access to information , especially that business does -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot of transparency now .
our politicians tell it , we say our president , even our ceos , say it even .
but if you get there to be done , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is frightening -- like this strange bear that still is vibrating .
it &apos;s undefined -- like this strange landland street .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is more risky ?
a whole shot of cool boots .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father was lying in the lie -- and there &apos;s a look at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions of the story .
there &apos;s a version , there &apos;s my version , and there are the real version . &quot;
so you see this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company to help us help us -- and only because i knew john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal the middle mate , and i had to go directly with my team .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i started trying to understand -- was that , if you start talking about these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a full problem .
i have friends who make big , huge , big hollywood movies , and i have friends that make little mental movies like me .
and my friends , the great , gigantic movies , tell me that the reason their movies are so successful , is to be branded you have .
and then my friends say , the little kind of foreign foreign movies , &quot; well , how are we going to do with this big , gigantic hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the last person ever ever . &quot;
so how are we going to see the gun in the movie ?
every time i do on the way , and whenever i put the medical bags , you &apos;ll see the brizoen ant .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you all good enough for this interview ?
are you there ? you see a little bit more nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should put a little bit before the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great gluten .
either &quot; flhyfusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise wind , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be organic for men and women -- you know , wheelon , or a stick , whatever .
so this is the shortcut .
now , i can answer all your questions and give them an excessive way .
we &apos;re a smaller token .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re an agent challenging .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so things like that -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , folks at -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
how words would you describe the gun ?
briban is on top .
that &apos;s a great question .
goodbye technology .
technology isn &apos;t technology is not the way you should describe something that somebody is doing under the eighth .
talk about cool , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes something positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting odor and humidity and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you right .
how can we square it longer -- better fresh , more fresh , more fresh , three times .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million company .
what about me ? what about the monarch species ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street that are like me , otto-normal consumer .
i should tell you about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to make nice clothes .
the &apos; 80s revival on skateral , except on the bathroom day .
all right , what &apos;s the sound toasty ?
unique .
i think the gene , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of craters and such a stuff .
but usually , i have a accessory , like sunglasses , or jewelry and so on .
if dan would be a brand , probably , it &apos;s likely to be a classic merceat cabrio .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , false fly .
it &apos;s part of a partial hippie , part yogi , erin king girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the kimuseum guy .
i sell the u.s. from museum everywhere around the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
that &apos;s my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i &apos;ve been treated .
man 5 : brand blarable alcohoger write .
is that ?
lawyer : i am a lawyer .
i am tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the tom-brand , but i &apos;m often seeing myself at the interface of the dark glamour and forger .
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could get into my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call &quot; branded . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zans in a lot .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nelaver , porcane , snake mark , to explore these clay personality .
if you could do it for those , you could help me .
you brought your pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me tell me just tell you a little bit of how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who have my global vision .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the best world is the world where you live -- like people around a way , the friends , the families , the way you live your life , the work .
all of all these are and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the beautiful day of my life .
what does that context is to the mind and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s as i like to be like .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are strange . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; why are you doing ?
what &apos;s the magate ? what puppets are they right now ?
why is it important to launch in new ? what &apos;s the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , not you .
what else do they tens of have gone through ?
... it doesn &apos;t be afraid . what kind of rollterstrip they are ?
eet eee ! thank you . thank you !
thank you for celebrating .
yes . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there was a lot of crazy things happening .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that your signature witness is separated two , but inevitably pages of pages -- the naive breaker is an eight / eight .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there is almost a contradiction with that .
and i think some companies are just focused on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend -- and that &apos;s the human nature of avoiding things that they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they turn them into themselves in a little bit of course , in a bit of a skill chess .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic man , apple .
and you can also see it here , in the target , gei , mini coops and jetblue .
now , there are a lot of brands , and eight-doubt brands , these things that come and go , but one punctures , eight brand is a pretty strong thing .
it &apos;s eight , play . how is your brand ?
if anybody asked them to describe their signature identity , how would you be ?
you have a big ? are you something that the blood is bringing the blood in your wallet ?
or are they more likely more than this ?
are you something that a little bit more quiet , more mature , conservative ?
there are numerous are things that are rich , things that are playful , right as the fresh prince , of course , adventurably , adventurous , all the like erol flynn , gadgets , nicky , magically , magic and mystical as gandalf .
or are they more like a distant one ?
are you mindful and mondan as a trillion 7 ?
are it , traditionally , traditionally , serendful , protective , compassionate , right ?
are it reliable , stable , cousins , safe , born , thoughtful and more like the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies wandering up and down , and they were no , &quot; no , they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , not control about the finished product .
but it was found 17 partners who were ready to dispense on these control , who wanted to do so eight and plays how to tell us , and finally , and then the lessons that we might not have to tell -- stories that ordinarily would never support .
they forced us tell us to tell the story of neuromarketing , such as we tell the story in this film , that we use mris to promote the lustades of the brain , and make a film as well .
we went to sao paulo , where foreign ads had been banned .
in the whole city , for five years , no foreseeze , no poster , don &apos;t go .
and we went to school counsters , where companies were running out their way into frowning schools in the near america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i received most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , these are where i interact with things .
and that &apos;s what these tags have done .
because they went to the middia , they went the agencies , and said , well , they don &apos;t really have any interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate on the artist directly directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will think about thinking that our world is challenging .
and how did that for you ? what was it successful ?
now , since the film of sundan film festival , we could see this .
according to a burm was the end in january , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million views of this film .
this includes only just about two-thirds per weeks ago .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
there was not given the film yet .
there is not even happening online . no one .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
now , finally , the film has gained a very large momentum .
and this is not bad for a project where almost any commercial agency we talked to , their customers have recommended to let the fingers .
something that i find what i believe is that when you reach your chance , you think that in these risks you need to be in these risks .
i think when you keep people off , you get them closer to fail .
i think , if you think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you prepare the whole company to acquire a profit .
i feel this is feeling that we need to encourage people to take risks to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to be afraid of options that might be scared .
finally , we should be welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
&quot; you welcome the fear . you welcome the risk .
a big dismantless , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit honesty brings us a little bit .
and that , with honesty and transparency , my heiaching talk , &quot; i &apos;ve been welcome to the transparency of my good with my good friends of emc. , who paid $ 40 for the nament rights care of ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world .
emc : &quot; you welcome to transparency &quot;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency : what &apos;s now about the $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , in front of the london organization , the satt foundation -- a check in the middle of $ 40 to 100 , in order in the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i was doing something else in google , and i paraphrase to do something with museums and art , and my chenel , which is now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun papers and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the screening .
there are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i think my personal perspective is very simple with this slide and access to it .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education for me -- i didn &apos;t complain -- but i had no access to a bunch of museums , and i had no access to make these art .
when i was traveling to visit these museums , and i started learning a lot of learning .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this desire -- art to make the art , lead technology together .
and then we got a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to show you with the demonstration , and tell you a few interesting things since the launch happened .
so you &apos;re just talking to google projec.com .
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , van gogh .
i actually , in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get up to two ways -- very simple .
so click and behold , it &apos;s in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and it works around .
they want to orient to the museum ?
open the map , and jumping with a click .
it &apos;s in the end , they want to end up to the end of the end .
just keep . much fun .
they &apos;re hitting them .
thank you , but the best is coming .
now , i am in front of one of my favorite pictures , serious brems in the met .
i see this goat sign .
when the museum gave us this picture , click on it .
this is now one of the images .
so these are all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this now .
this is one of the images that we have captured with with the so-called gugapic technology .
so , for example , this picture has about 10 billion bases , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion models ? &quot;
so i &apos;ll show you that .
you can zoom in and zoom in .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unpaid .
but then you really want to go deep into it .
and so i began to play around and realized that something is happening there .
and i thought , &quot; well , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to close , and i slowly realized that these children actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit , with some known known when i met , and actually found it was to be a game called liail , where it at the poster &apos;s seat .
it seemed quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
and to really close to go , you can go to the retreat .
and just to give you out , i click out , so you see what you get .
so here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is coming in -- in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump quickly to moma again , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
in the forecase , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the pink cart ?
and the only thing that if you want to see was how van gogh was born in this master work ?
you &apos;re zooming in . you can really walk in .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite little bits of this picture , until i really am torn .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
and many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , the collections .
every one of you , anybody , whether it &apos;s rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- don &apos;t matter .
you can go back to your own museum online , and you can put out of all these pictures out of these pictures .
just just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of it -- you can zoom around .
this is the nickandans , the national bian .
you can put it out , send your friends , and you &apos;ll start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things are not from google .
it doesn &apos;t even come from the museums .
i might not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was a humility experience for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be in the same way with this digital medium of art , and it &apos;s built open online .
the biggest question that &apos;s been asked me recently is , &quot; did you make the experience of a museum ticket ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it should be connected .
that &apos;s what it is about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a diagram of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical page , and then half the rights that the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the aptite to measure any organ , we could represent your brain .
for instance , this one would be completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
well , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of course , some of us might have decided for one of these extreme , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain something like this -- with a high aptite that is in the same hemisphere .
it &apos;s not as if you &apos;re both exclusive or anything .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so , as one of the individuals , i look at most of the most advanced physics , which is a good amount of logic to bring together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuitions about the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play play and see how it responds , and then we start developing our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing that can be just at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing about two different places is , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
and i remember playing a kid on a moving threshold .
he was another kid , and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i &apos;ll bet that play with the ground threshold was a very valuable lesson , which is the great things you just don &apos;t just get over , and that they &apos;re in a position .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not overweight physicists .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because it doesn &apos;t play the soil swamp ; with these little odd particles .
and if you play your particles with your particles , you see all kinds of strange things -- how to fly directly through walls , or that you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t confess my intuition , and it might only because i don &apos;t have the particles anymore .
well , i &apos;ll play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it yet .
i mean , no one ever has seen a particle .
but my logical meaning hasn &apos;t got it too much .
because if all kinds of particles are , and all of these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t simply follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i see no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel very much better with the whole thing if we might show that everyday objects are the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical fashion .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
i &apos;m bigger here . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so , so what we look at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s shaped like a springboard , and it stands over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new silicon and raved for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last few , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of floating pool and get the thing .
this thing has the capacity to be in the quantum mechanical position , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to feel it , or , frankly , frankly .
so quantum mechanics is that unmoving objects are just right .
the drivers of unmoving objects are not just people , but the lights that seems to them , and the wind , the wind of you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of gnp was a quantum mechanically , we had to throw all of these dishes out .
and we did that .
we put out the light , put it into a vacuum , and it blew up the whole air and cooling it down to almost at the elevator , and it was filled with the piece of metal , behavior just wanted to behave .
so we measured his movement .
we found it moved really strange .
instead , instead of it , it &apos;s just silent , vibrating it , and the way it &apos;s vibrating was something like this -- sort of a sophisticated and interconnected bubble of flies .
and in which we gave him a little bit , we were able to be able to vibrate it to the same time and not vibrating -- something that &apos;s allowed only in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what is truly awesome .
what does it mean to vibrating a object at the same time and not fit ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from which the piece of metals are silent down there , and the same time are moving up the same atoms .
just too precise points points to vote .
they &apos;re dolphin &apos;s rest of time .
that means that every atom of the same time is at two different places , which is the same time , which is the same time is that the whole different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth my year for the clean room , because , you can check it , the basic difference between a single atom and that piece of metal is about just the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places in the same time , this piece of metal at two different places can be , why not yet ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page is .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at a different time with several places , what would it feel ?
how would your mind handle that your body is atrooczed ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we stood up , the light turned into and looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was going to be there in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the elevator , are actually just a open-source objects that are connected together in a small space .
you hear a lot of words about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to anything .
well , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections , all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be focused on how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that , when families think about it , where they want life and work , it &apos;s given to choose between at least between a hand full of different cities that are all in the competition for new residents .
at the moment , we have far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs them .
so we could just be able to keep the world very easily with duzons , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now that may sound absurd for you , soads you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just move out the building home against cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they already don &apos;t do it ; they don &apos;t have the other half .
you might try to expand the capacity for existing homes already .
but you know what you know , what they would have to do in these apartments and their environment forces legislation to avoid excellence and to deflect from the exploitation .
so it turns out to be very hard to get all these extended paths .
but you could go to a completely new place , building a completely new housing block , except the laws would support one such and cannot stop it .
so i suggested that governments create new surfaces that offer enough space for a city , and they gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i &apos;ve found that , about the same time , jajavio and octavio about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 honans were leaving her country around the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , and they can do exactly the same same thing in hong duras .
at this point has said , in fact four to octavivivio , &quot; what happens if we have an undefeated surface of our country , which , if we just have a message -- part of the american embassy ; one of the canadian rules or the united states , can be working there , and can on the area of this information , usually want to have to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras under a profound disfletable of the rise .
in the next planning of the elections , the call pep lobo in a turnon the recycling of the system of both new sections as well .
he asked an antavio to become a stable kiss .
so in the interview of the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through advances , try and test through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to reduce elements .
the first point , the importance of the laws , laws , determine that you cannot tolerate existing housing owners .
we pay a new technology of technology , but for the progress of progress , there requires technologies and laws , and there are certainly laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , there was a friend of a professor called octavio of a tedtalk .
again , it showed him showed him four .
the two blew me .
and they say , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we set in december in december , we met a hotel in miami in december .
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure how valuable cities are about how much more valuable they are when they cost .
and i used this graph to show you how valuable rohland is on a place like new york , think that a surface in some cases per square meter is worth of dollars of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at a place where a break had a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk , in a very simple shape , is that a charter city is a place whose beginning is more uninhabited country , a greener contract , the laws that govern the laws , and the people who are capable of deciding to live under those rules or not .
and so i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant we need to be able to do this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the path is to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to tegucigalard again at the fourth and fifth january a talk .
so i &apos;ve been obsessed with facts of facts that has taken a graph like this one has tried to show that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport , which was built in denver .
by that airport alone , a surface of 100 square miles .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hondurans if you want to build a new city , you have to start at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
we &apos;re too , we all shot .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and notice .
the director of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you heart for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop here . &quot;
so i set up , and you played the tedtalk .
and i came to the core statement that a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in hong duras , rather than hundreds of miles apart in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of honduras would be dependent on the help between partner countries , they could benefit from their partner countries , and they would support the laws for building the law for that charter , and they would be able to help the charter that the charter the charter .
and the implications of president lobo , was that the luxury of transformation that i was thinking as a way to get the foreign investors to build and build the city for all parties in hong duras , who have been depleted under many years of years of fear and mistrust suffering .
we &apos;re driven in an area .
this is from this place .
it &apos;s a thousand square miles .
and shortly after , in the 19th of january , they have voted for a change in the constitution to have a displacement act that &apos;s made for special developmental areas .
in a country which has just been a stable crisis of the crisis , in congress , was elected by a voice for a voice .
all parties , all the jobs of the society supporting this .
in order to be part of the constitution , it has to be marked twice by congress .
on the 17th , the second time it was authled with 114 to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th , a delegation of about 30 were about the two sites of the world that were most interested in the business of the city building .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban center , which is built in southern korea , big than the city of the city city .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it &apos;s taken for four years to get the approval of the approval .
the other place that was very interested in the city is singapore .
it &apos;s been built already two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so when you know , if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a building site , and they already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that fetuses are meant to be involved , and it &apos;s going to be working on an external rights system .
a country has been offered to provide its supreme court to provide as the dish for the ultimate appeal of the interstate courtship system .
the city designers are very , very interested .
they even bring money to finance .
one thing you &apos;ve already known is , there &apos;s a lot of teners .
there are a lot of units that would like to put up in america , especially in a place with a free-trade zone , and there are many people who love to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world , there are 700 million people to say that they like to continue to live on another place .
one million people are leaving america every year and migrate to the united states .
many of you are a lot of people who are forced to make their families back to their work , sometimes local mothers who have to make enough money to eat and clothing .
sadly , sometimes , sometimes kids who are trying to find their parents back in some cases have never seen for a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about thinking in hong tourism , a completely new city ?
or even building a dust of these cities , or hundreds of around the world ?
so , what is it is for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition around new residents ?
that &apos;s an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey recently , over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that messes with a typical american person in a day is 70 .
in addition , a study has done a study that they saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists just give up the different themes with whom these ceo are busy and how much time they teach decisions to hang together with the themes .
and they &apos;ve found that a typical ceo of education on the week are devoted to 139 assignments .
each one of these subjects from many , many smaller decisions .
fifty percent of their decisions have been hit by nine minutes or less met .
for about 12 percent of their decisions , they took an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of people in an hour ?
how good , you know , do you think you &apos;re able to solve the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest decision problems of our modern day , the decision surplus problem .
i want to talk about the problem , and about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , only the hand , if you &apos;re going to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask them a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the decision overworth problems ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very highly exclusive grocery store ; at least it was really exclusive .
it was a shop that was called a kite .
this business , it was almost like a fantasy factory .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and vegetables , and more than two dozen different species of water -- and that was at a time than we were actually drink water water .
i loved it into the store ; but at a time i asked myself , well , how do you ever buy something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil hit .
they had over 75 different different varieties of olive oil , including those who were locked in gosts that came from a thousand years of old olive trees .
so i decided to go to visit to one day of people , and i asked the leader , &quot; works this model , do you really have these options for all these options ? &quot;
and it showed on the bus charges of tourists every day came and usually their cameras .
we chose to do an experiment , and we chose mars for our experiment .
this is their marches up .
they had 348 different kinds of marches .
we set up a little bit of a little bit of payline right on the entrance .
we &apos;ve we have six different pressures of the marijuana or 24 different pressures of the earth , and we looked at two things : first , i &apos;d try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try there ?
it &apos;s more people left when there were 24 , about 60 percent , when there were six , about 40 percent .
and then afterwards , we saw what people bought a glass of marches .
now we saw the reversal effect .
of the people who were used to be 24 were , only three percent were actually a glass of marches .
the people who were there were when there were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mars .
now , if you put it out , people buy six times more like a glass of marijuana , who they had six to vote when they had 24 to vote .
now , you don &apos;t buy a glass of mars is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tadal -- but it turns out that the decision reduces problems in a lot of material information decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide when it comes to our own best interests .
so for the theme of the day , financial saving .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now one study of gur huberica , ei jolang , in which we were considered a million-million-american citizens of about $ replacement people in the entire united states .
and what we saw was whether the number of foundsers were able to be able to be able to get a retirement savings plan , the 404 plan that affects probability of whether more for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a connection in doing it .
so in those plans , we had about 657 plans that people offered something about about two to 59 fund fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered , that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans , the two fund , has had a split in the 1970s -- still not the high as we want it .
in the plans for nearly 60 fund , the transit budget fell on about the sixth percentage .
now turns out is that , even if you get to participate , when more of you were standing , then it has negative consequences .
so the people who are attracted to participate is more likely that the more options they were available to them , the more they were used to vote .
so the more options they were available with them , the more they were doing their whole money in pure money market .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone has recommend by people when their future financial well-being matters us .
well , in the last 10 years , in humans , we &apos;ve seen the three basic negative consequences that provide more and more choice .
they push the decision -- push them up , even when it comes against their own self-interest .
they &apos;re more rewarding decisions -- worse finance and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things to feel less happy , even when they make it more objective .
the main reason for this is we may be brilliant food to look at these huge habitats of mayonaise , mustard , oil and marters , but we can &apos;t be able to capture the comparison and disrupt and then can actually choose something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest to you today is now four simple techniques -- techniques that test us in different types of research in a variety of research -- they can just use in their business .
first of thing : reverse .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it hasn &apos;t been true than today today , that less more than today .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; reduce . &quot;
they always worry that they lose regalspace .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more and more , if you &apos;re ready to limit yourself , and you &apos;re going to get out of unimportant things like , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;ll be reduced , and there , it &apos;s cost ; there . &amp; amp .
as a proctor and gamble , the various head of the various head and a half species of 26 , they lived one increase in sales .
when the golden cat corporation sold 10 at the worst of the worst , katcensorus , they concluded that the death was going to go to 97 percent -- a result of the people who are going to pay for the rise of sales and reduce costs .
you know , the average supermacrt today offers 4,5,000 products .
so a typical of them about 100,000 products today .
but the nine-largest supermarket , who &apos;s now the nine-largest supermarket in the world is aldi , and they only offer 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now , in the world of savings , i believe one of the best examples of the market has been done on the market , about how to get the best choice , was something that david smoirason has a very strong , it &apos;s a program at harvard .
every single harvard staff is automatically taking part of a lifetime fund .
those who really want to make a choice will be 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to fix it .
it &apos;s all important options . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m asking the employee is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other .
and if their employees cannot keep them apart , their customers can &apos;t . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to provide all of the people in this audience , including to the most beautiful road to the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and asked them to clad you to clap if you &apos;re ready to take .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to adopt gary screen .
so are all that ?
well , let me show you something more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i might have heard more hands .
good .
the fact that they &apos;re looking at is a objective , when the first time was more information than the second time , but i would guess the car would be grounded it in the second time .
because the images made it aspire for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps them allocate with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s very specific .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between options , understanding what the consequences with individual possibilities are associated , and that these consequences have to be increasingly functional .
why do people spend about 15 to 30 percent more , if you use an ec-map or a credit or a credit card than they do ?
because we really don &apos;t feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it a little bit , it feels a bit more concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool so you get people to save more .
so , in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro tero , we &apos;ve done a study of people working with people who worked with people &apos;s team -- these people have worked for a gang -- and these people have been in a gang in a tribe for their participation for their rale .
and during this session , we &apos;ve seen these meetings exactly as it was always , except we added a small thing .
the small idea that we added up was we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation around 20 percent , and there was a variety of people who were willing to save or a rise to pay four percent they were willing to pay for the savings account for the savings .
third technology : categorization .
we can do better with more techniques than with more choices .
here &apos;s for instance , a study that we did in a time gang gang .
it turns out that in the monsoon level , it &apos;s centered down in the northeast range , varably , the number between 331 different kinds of magazines to be 64 papers .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and i show them in 10 categories of interest , and i show you 400 papers , and these are 20 periods of time , you believe that i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better experience than i would have given them the 400 than i have given them .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so here are two different cooking papers .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
if you think that the left display is over and the ad on the right is jazz , then you clap it in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
so if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right side is , please clap .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is , but you know what ?
this is a high-unuseful categorization unit .
the categories have to tell us a little bit , not the driver &apos;s choice .
and you see this problem often when you look at the long shots all these funds .
who would you like to find out ?
my fourth technology is the premise of complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll give you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated choice : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german car manufacturer that offers to you the possibility of making their car altogether .
you &apos;ve got to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices they provide per decision .
car color , foreign color , i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four chances .
what i do now is , i change the sequence of decisions .
half of the clients is going to be from the many possibilities , 56 car colors to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers are from low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 car color , many chances .
what am i looking at me ?
how interest as they are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choices of choice , that means you &apos;re going to be challenged , the heitest , i &apos;ll lose it .
what they find out is that the people who are going from the low risk of voting , and again , and again the default choice will be choosing .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choices too much , then you stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of options .
the only thing that i &apos;ve done is changing the order in which this information is presented .
when i start with the simple , i learn how to choose .
even though the gears vote , i don &apos;t know anything about my preferences in the inner apparatus , that i still choose to choose it .
it also gets me excited about the great product that i put together , and so i &apos;m ready to make care of it .
let me wrap it up .
and i &apos;ve been showing you about four techniques , which is the problem of making decisions overcomcomching -- limited -- get the surplus of extra alternatives ; concrete -- make it work ; we can do better deal with more categories , less opportunities .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help them support the possibility -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people that they provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re eleccere of choice .
and the more we &apos;re electing to choose , the better we &apos;re going to be able to be able to practice the compassionate art .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trend-managers at youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube video .
it &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be marketed , and then , why that &apos;s important .
we all want stars , celebrity , singer , comedians -- and when i was young , it seemed to be incredibly difficult .
but web videos allow us to be able to be all of our creative activities , in a part of the world &apos;s culture .
every single one of you might be about the internet to the nearest saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours per minute is uploaded .
again , only a tiny percentage will ever look up , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands and thousands and thousands of times .
so how does it work ?
three things : tastemaker , part-sex communities , and unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
ohhhhh , wholaww !
last year , this video was vasvquez , who shot his house in yosemite park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like when the video was finally popular for the first day .
it didn &apos;t really want to make a viral video .
he wanted to just divide a rainbow .
because you can do that as if you call the hurricane mountain mountain .
he had a lot of natural videos up .
and this video was actually captured in january .
so what happened here ?
there was hisbrush .
jimmy kimzes the tweet that made the video at the end of the end .
because tastemaker like jimmy row offers new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s a friday thing , of course . you &apos;re going to get on friday by friday . all the time go forward , right ? friday , junk . gettin &apos; on friday on friday . you don &apos;t think we &apos;d be able to lead this conversation without talking about the video .
rebecca mackel is one of the popular practitioners of the year .
it &apos;s been around 200 million times this year .
here &apos;s the picture .
it seems like &quot; double monsoon , &quot; it seems to be coming from nothing .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are open days .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , tosh.0 , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson was on the top science theater was a first person who did a joke about twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or group of tastemaker took a point of view with a large audience , and it &apos;s confusing that process .
and so this community of people who shared this big in-joke together , and started talking about it and playing around with it .
now we have 10,000 talents of youtube at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there were a memorial for every single day of day .
unlike the one-page conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is to become part of the phenomenon -- either by making it spreading or something new .
&quot; nyan cat is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , simple .
this year , it &apos;s been done almost 50 million times .
and if you stop that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version that &apos;s been looking at four million times .
even cats , look at this video .
cats look at cats watching this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that exists in the internet culture of technologies and the performers .
there were taping .
somebody did an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole new community shot out of the soil , which made it a stupid joke to something we can all participate .
now we don &apos;t really think of something simple about something , we &apos;re doing .
who would have been able to look at this ?
who could have &quot; double rain&quot; or explosions or &quot; nyan cat , &quot; ?
what do they call people write in which they have an urgent place ?
so in a world where every minute two days of video is uploaded to the fact , only unique and unexpected emerges as the speakers presented video .
i was not interested in , i wasn &apos;t really interested , when a friend said , &quot; i should look at this great video about a guy who was protesting on the new york on new york .
i got a traffic ticket , because i didn &apos;t play on the bike , but often , there are disabilities that have been able to drive a ticket to the bike .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey niesteal was funny idea , and his argument for five million million times .
this approach has true to everything we &apos;re creative .
and it all leads to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
whohhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative communities , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to each other and refer to the auditorium .
as i said , one of the right largest stars -- justin bieber did him with youtube .
no one needs to give your ideas green .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they also succeed forever , but they will determine the conversation the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the interhaul between women over three generations , and how the astonishing power of that interhaul in life in a four-year-old girl , her mother and night , five days in the chinese sea , a connection , in a connection , living in the life of this little , and never disappeared -- this little girl , living in san francisco , and today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still combined .
i want to tell you some of the puzzle bits .
so , imagine the first piece : a guy is burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose entire life of the simple hope of unity and freedom had been combined .
if you think of it in the march of the communications in saigon , he has to confess that life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , spotkilled now .
he went back to the silence .
he died , broke through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot to his life .
i had to worry about it that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to break us down , but we were overwhelmed .
the next piece of the puzzle is how a boat in the early moral red is quieted in the lake .
my mom may be 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , the life had asked her to a task : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely constrained that it could fail .
after a four-year-old and film tire saga , a boat tied to the lake , as a forest boat .
all the adult adults , the risks were predictable .
the biggest fear of the great fear of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little toxic bottle per .
in fact , when i was a crime , i would have had my sister and i was able to drink her myself and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the crew of the engine , a clap of every wave on the bug , the width and empty horizon .
i remember , i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came many times , but from the death of the death of the men on the men on our boat , they didn &apos;t want to start out of the engine of the size hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the 190ian coast , and on the young man who broke together and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first manrock that gave me one of the men in the platform .
no apple ever missed it again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
and the nearest puzzle is about four women in three generations that are building a new life .
we let &apos;s going down in the football bin , one of the workclass temperate , the population of beemountain &apos;s layers .
unlike the elderly , in the age of middle grade areas whose existence was completely unknown , there was no way in the football .
the scaffolding from laghts out of the lavene is coming from the rest of the world .
and the broken english comes between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mom worked on farms , then on a wheeler in a car factory , six days , double layers .
it somehow managed to be able to find english and doing english skill .
we were poor .
every dollar has been published , and it was put into a more training for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do . mostly , the new things that came out of second hand .
two are two in the school , every , to cover the holes in the other .
a school uniform until the buttons , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare &quot; painful chams of listening from &quot; the butt eye , &quot; and there is malings , &quot; asiates , go home . &quot;
after right home ?
something that swiwer to me .
there was a meeting to shame and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mom was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and i heard about our grandmother &apos;s motions in the house .
my mother suffered from nightdreams of boat .
and it was my job to stay awake , until their alpha dreams came so that i could make it up .
she opened up a computer store , then made a cosmedal training , and he also opened a store .
and the women came out with their stories of men who didn &apos;t get the change , angry and unflexible , and more serious children , captured between two worlds .
loans and mandates were readed .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student who drew unmistaken .
in the other hand , i was involved in uncertain life , carrying the tragic scars of violence , the drugs of the drug of the drug and insulation .
and so many people got over the years .
and because of that aid , i became convicted of judaism for the last year of london county .
and i was put on a piece of the puzzle to the nearest katapules , and not in the fringings .
tan le , anonymous dashray of the football , was now tan , refugee and social activist , had been invited to talk to talk about places that she &apos;d never heard , and in habitats , whose existence would never have imagined .
i don &apos;t familiar with the labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the weekends and the comfort of my life &apos;s life , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who told each of their days , as they &apos;ve been told each day , told each other stories from each other the stories , we still sleep each other in the same bed .
i told my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me reminded me that i was so old as she was when we had the boat rose .
no , no longer been an opportunity .
&quot; do it just say , &quot; she said , &quot; and be not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about judaism , training and education , and the neglected of the marginalized and disagreed .
and the more open to me , the more i should tell .
i met people in all life , so many of them were doing what they loved , living on the limits of the possible .
and while i graduated , i realized that i could not find myself with a career in law .
there had to be a different piece of the puzzle .
and i realized at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be an underdog , new comvils , new in the picture -- not just okay , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
because it can be reflected as easily to collapse of the horizon , it can mean that you accept the trends of the environment .
now , i &apos;ve gone now enough from my comfort hall to know that , yes , the world break apart , but not as you fear it .
possibilities that hasn &apos;t been allowed to be very encouraged .
there was a energy , an unfavorable optimism , a strange mixture of the humility and the tamnish .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around the shed , &quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; an unproven challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of one day i cook a giant pot soup that we shared .
we were working late to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were a little brilliant thing , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull out in the u.s .
just for a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and i kept the adventure .
before i leave the lecture , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time when the confuanism was the social norm , and the people who were the most important person .
in centuries , life had been changed .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother went on her alone .
she was 17 party the second woman said her mother beat her .
without her party of her husband , she was worried for a sense by placing him in court and gravel in her own case , and a even bigger sense when she won .
&quot; don &apos;t work until it &apos;s untrue .
i just duved in a hotel room in sydney when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the dushed motion , and i saw them on the other side .
i knew it knew it was to say goodbye .
my mom called me for a few minutes .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in courscray and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories , and we were insurance that we were still with her .
by midnight , the monch came and said he had to close the sarg .
my mom asked us to hold her hand .
and she asked the monch , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been dancing tomorrow today , &quot; he said .
&quot; you haven &apos;t left them .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s about the women .
so , you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men that might have come into our lives would be .
defeat was too simple .
now i &apos;d like my own children , and i just think about the boat .
who would have ever wish ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid to be privileged , deliberation , deliberation .
can i give you a bug in your life , the audacity of every wave , forced , steady tuckellant of the engine of the horizon , who doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that one and get them through it , i would do it .
and also , mom &apos;s parents is born at the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it a big photograph at all ?
because of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t capture with your camera .
and yet my interest in photography , when i first received my first digital camera in the age of 15 .
i combined it with my former prepassionate for drawing , but it was a little bit different because it was a little bit of the camera planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , it ends up the process when you press the trigger .
so for me , in photography , it seemed to be more about being about being the right place to be the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trigger gets fooled .
pictures like this : a building along a lot of payline street .
but it has an unexpected twist .
it was a realistic level , though .
or photos like this -- dark and colorful at the same time , but everybody with the shared objective , keeping a realistic level .
if i am reality , i &apos;m the photo reality .
because of course , of course , it &apos;s not something that you really can capture , but i always want to let it look like it might have , on a photo .
pictures where you need to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea , just a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is the detail or the color ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the last time , it &apos;s about how we look at the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not maximically realistic , but we think about intelliming .
so i think the principles are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take multiple pieces and put together an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly sophisticated physical objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that is still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we overlist our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t seem very well , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that look like a picture of realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us around us in our lives .
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just look false .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special pictures .
but combine them combine something special about this .
so the first rule is that kiva should have combined pictures of the same perspective .
secondly , we should be combined pictures of the same lighting system .
and these two pictures , these two missions , shot out of the same altitude , and the same light system .
and third is that &apos;s about how to make it impossible to vary where the individual images are starting and ends , by connecting them seamlessly .
there &apos;s impossible to be impossible to say how the photo was actually combined .
so by putting color , contrast and helliency of the margins , photographic abuse , like field , deholed colors and disorders , we wipe the boundary between the different images , and then let them look like a single photo , even though a picture can contain hundreds of levels of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s a landscape picture , and the bottom is manipulating .
but this picture is completely composed in reality , from photographs of different places .
i personally , personally , it &apos;s easier to create a place than finding a place , because you don &apos;t have to take compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed for several months to make them look at the different places for the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a blade trip .
the bank was from a different place .
the underwater part comes from a brick .
and yes , i even put the house up on the island of red to let it look at sweden .
so to reach a realistic outcome , it &apos;s considered to be seen from me .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
after that &apos;s the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of very good .
and when you do good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so these are all the tools there , and the only thing that we have is lying is our imagination .
thank you .
so i &apos;d like to talk to you why many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced to the bikd university was to provide a major listener .
you don &apos;t think of it particularly science -- you put a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , cousins , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe only the most of the electronic health projects fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-up . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button , it &apos;s from .
and every morning i turn on .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i turn up on the street , send my data on google health .
and then , you &apos;re going to be called a general doctor , so that he can see where my values is a problem , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need cardiological assistance , but with a look at the past .
there is something else .
you might be familiar with this , i &apos;ve got 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning i wander on my wlan-up and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little letpants salad .
but this is the closest thing , which can happen , because this is the group forced , group forced to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or whether patients could actually used to smoke .
it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and get them to play any kind of game in order to control their health better .
next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little blood pressure sensor that you put in an iphone or something .
and it will enable people to measure from home their blood pressure , send it to their physician , to share it , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patient comes in play . they can &apos;t just take control of their own ship , the captain on their own ship , but can we help us with health care in the challenges that lie from us , and the price explosion of health , double demand , and so on .
so , make the ways that are easy to use and start to connect with those people in the team .
and you can do that through these practices , but also crowdsource .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones , maybe .
we know exactly where all the atasts are around the way of the money .
we know one more where all the gasoline places are .
and yeah , we can find the fast food chains .
but where would the next ag , to help this patient ?
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving was going to be found in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we used to crowdsource the netherlands .
we &apos;ve created a website and asked a human devil , &quot; if you see an aol , please share it where it is when it &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and over 10,000 technologies went on in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps .
and we &apos;ve created an ion app .
we have developed an app for layered , augmented reality to find this technique .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht and you break someone together , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can also get microbike mobile phone , to find the next ag that can save lives .
and from today , we don &apos;t want to just be as an iranian 4u , as the product is called , but as an iranian 4us .
and we want to bring that to a global level .
and we asked our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us conduct like klight points , to help this research on the world around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and you break them together , be your own kin or anything else , you can find an aed .
the other thing we want to ask is is that companies around the world help us with guidance of this research .
these could be journalists , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the prayer lasts is still in its place .
please help us and try and take your health just better , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology business .
and my little startup would want us to force to the environment by ...
it &apos;s how it &apos;s crowdsourcing .
so here is a quick video about what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it might take away until it &apos;s downloaded .
now -- now , we can skip this -- i &apos;m just going to immerse the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year of work in a neighborhood that is so pretty different , and so we actually have worked , we &apos;ve worked it work .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peacescorle for computer geeks .
we pick up a fellows every year and we &apos;re working with urban lanes .
so instead of shipping them in the third world , we send them to the rathco .
and they developed great apps , with urban employees .
but what they really do is show is how technology is possible today .
so they make al .
al is a hydrant in boston .
here it looks like when he searches after a date , but what he really does is he &apos;s looking forward , someone lit him out , when it &apos;s asleep , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter snow .
how did he come to look at these special kinds of help ?
we just last year , we had a team of fishers in boston in the &quot; code for america &apos;s code .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s been a lot last february .
and they realized that the city never leaves these fire hydrant .
but one of particular fellow , a guy named erik francis ruselk obman , who noticed another one , and that was that the residents of the sidewalks were releasing open up in front of these parts .
so he did what every good organization would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can take hydrant .
you pay attention to him free , if it snows .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody else can take it away .
so , there &apos;s a nice little play dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but it does does something that no other government technology does .
it spreads it rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in i.m. davis in the city of honolulu who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , so that the citizen tsunami , the citizens of michoacamonized .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunters work in spades , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to test her .
and then decided to use seattle , using the app to clean the citizens to clean the clocking gulls .
and chicago has just launched it , so that people would open up the bubs when it snows .
we know nine cities are planning now to use this app .
and it has spread a metabolism , it &apos;s organic , of course .
if you know something about state technology , you know it &apos;s not like this .
it takes of software takes a few years .
we had a team that had worked last year in boston , last year for the three and a half and a half months .
it was about a method where parents can find out which are the right public schools for their children .
we were told us later that if it took about the normal channels it took over two years , and it took it over two million dollars .
that &apos;s nothing at all .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california edge project that took the taxpayer for two billion dollars now , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of the government .
so an app that is written in a few days is written in a couple of days , and then it spreads by turbulent , is a kind of milemark on the institution to the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think they should .
and not even like an engineering company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and this is important .
but more important about this app is that it represents a new generation that releases the activity of government -- not as the problem of a sales institution , but as a problem of collective reserve .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at the collective act of digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make tools that we need to tackle things effectively effectively .
it &apos;s not just the code for america , and there are hundreds of people around the country that beat up and making government apps every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it ; they fix them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and so this is , if you keep all your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in the core , in the heart , tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we &apos;re doing together . &quot; we can &apos;t do alone alone . &quot;
there are a lot of people have given up .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i urge you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
and because the government finally gets their power out of us -- it reminds you , &quot; we know the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , changes how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was primarily to choose to help people in their office .
now , for two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s particularly in the community where they &apos;re located rats .
this is the call center for service and information .
there you normally get out when you call them 311 .
if you ever have a chance to work in your village call a new call center , like our fellow scott syller as part of the program -- in fact do you know that the people -- will you see the people who call the government for many different problems , including many problems in your house .
scott gets to get this anfruass .
it &apos;s called &quot; thylacine rat &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the veterinarian .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and play a nice music , and see if the livestock ? &quot;
and that worked . they did it for scott .
but that was not the end of the thylacine rats .
boston didn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an app , an internet , manual app , called &quot; citizens connected . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have written that app .
this is working very smart people in the office of new urban , in boston .
and one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; the thylacine rat in my trash vacuum cannot tell whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to citizens connect , &quot; it &apos;s different .
scott underthought of human to human .
but in citizens connect , it &apos;s all public , so everybody else can see .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got , &quot; i went over there , found the garbage whale behind the house .
thylacine ? yes . alive ? yap .
it turned down the ground . went home .
good night , cute thylacine . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital one .
and it &apos;s also a good example of getting the government to crowdsource .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not really talking about a technological definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped a different citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they were both of these people .
and you could have to connect them with government supplies , if they had needed , but a neighbor is far better and cheaper alternative services .
when a neighbor is helping the other , we strengred our communities .
let &apos;s a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but you think that one is the other input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is .
how many people have voted a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we refuse , and we expect the government , our values , and it becomes fulfilled our values , and then not changed a lot .
this is because government is like a walking ocean and politics is the top 15centimeter .
and what &apos;s below it is what we call office cracy .
and we use this word like this .
but it &apos;s this thought that we own , and for whom we pay for it , we pay something that works against us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to do bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the government is happening .
we have we need to the machinery of government .
so the occupy tuthesiac movement did .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concern citizens , who wrote a very detailed 325 page report , which is a response to the far-meme about the financial reform for financial reform .
it &apos;s not politically active , this is bureaucratic activity .
now for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about it , about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to think about .
do we really believe that we &apos;re going to do what we &apos;re going to do , without improving the institution that can cause ourselves in the name of us all of us ?
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology can make it possible , shifted the function of government perceiving the function of the government , in a way that can actually achieve .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things in common , you need to build the same systems .
now the average age of seniors is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see her voice as of course .
they don &apos;t fight this struggle that we all struggle about who are going to be talking about ; they all .
you can think of your mind , at every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improves the government &apos;s work .
and these apps , we use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be , hydrant hydrates , uncurate , to break a trash bar with a time .
and certainly , we would have given these these fire hydrants all over time , and lots of people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who are the government , they &apos;re willing to taxes .
more than we are , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government better until we improve the state of citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve got for you all here : if it comes to the big important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be just a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role in describing the people like wonderful the new technologies that are coming on , and i thought i was here with friends , i would tell you what i really think about , and understand , with these incredible reference to the way that we can barely have to keep .
so i &apos;m going to start showing you just a single , boring slide .
... you might just show the slide .
this is a slide that i chose accidentally from my folders .
it &apos;s not about the details of this slide , but rather about the overall form .
this slide shows data from us about the power of risc processors compared to the performance of a production area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so many others , which we often make in our field , is a sort of tiny hybridend curve .
in other words , every step here is a potency here in a sustainable scale .
and that &apos;s an innovation that we need to use the scale of semi-logarithmic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could take the lights back again .
another thing a little bit , because i &apos;m going to draw the paper right now .
now why do we draw graphs in the technology on the semi-logarithmic curves ?
the reason for that is , if i looked at it in a normal curve , where we say , these years are the years , so the timeline is a kind , and this is a random mass of technology that i want to be with a graph of reference to a graph , and that is silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now if i want to record another technology , we &apos;re going to say a transportation technology , then , on the semi-by-crush scale , it would be incredibly irrational , in terms of a flat line .
but if this happens something like this , then this is a high situation .
so , if fast as fast as fast as the microprocess of processor work , then we could go into a taxi , and we would be 30 seconds in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not so fast .
there &apos;s never been done in the history of the technology project , that kind of recursal growth , which is going exponentially increases all the time .
the question i &apos;d like to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s all about over and forever , as fast as now .
there are two options .
either there will be a classic chart , like here , to something completely new , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s something in about .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something in the way that will happen here .
it &apos;s really , really , it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , into a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often think of itself , is the way that this is going to be like ?
what &apos;s the new condition that takes the world ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and the people were talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people are talking about the future , and you realize the future is still in 2000 .
so we don &apos;t keep .
so in other words , the future of the year is around a year since i am on this world .
i think that &apos;s the reason is we realize that something is happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that right now doesn &apos;t make a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because it &apos;s going to what we don &apos;t do .
so , i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
so to do that , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think to understand this , we need to go back and look at a long time scale .
and that is going to look at the ground measure of earth .
and i think the big picture will make sense when you divide it into a billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back and go back to two billion years , the earth was a big , sterile blob with lots with lots of these chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it &apos;s a pretty good picture of how they behaved .
i think there are theories that have been done to understand how everything with rna is starting , but i &apos;m going to show you a simplistic story of what is that long oil droplet , who affected by chemicals with chemicals .
some of these oil droplet , a special combination of chemicals , which it allows them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and so forth .
everyone was so , began to divide .
these little oil droplet were the most primitive cell form .
but though , these oil , of course , these oil phones were not alive in the same way , because each one of them was just a small , random prescription of chemicals .
and every time it shared , the chemicals have spread to unequal quantities .
so each of course was a little bit different .
in fact , the droplet were growing up for one for the growth of secret composition faster than others and more integrated and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so those inference to survive longer , and they &apos;re breeding in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , it &apos;s going to be , if those droplet have learned a trick about abstraction .
in addition to any of us , that we don &apos;t really understand , these droplet learn the ability to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the cell as information is in a particular chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , in this mental , evolutionary way , they found a way that allowed them to be decommissioned what they were stored so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this sort of thing is to store information over the time of 2.5 billion years when it happened .
in fact , the recipe for us is for us , which is our genes coming from exactly the same code and the same painting .
and every living thing , any up with the exact same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can write , to write in this code .
and i &apos;ve been 100 microgram of a soft pulse , which i &apos;m going to attempt to keep in airports of security .
in this is there is -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve done this code -- the code is normal letters , which we use for symbolic -- and i wrote my business map on a piece of dna , and it reinforced it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if anybody wants a hundred million copies of my business map , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i &apos;d have been an atheist , i would have written them on a virus and release in the room .
so what &apos;s next step ?
the downs of dna was an interesting step .
and that &apos;s what are going on -- that &apos;s been happy for another billion years .
but then , another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that is starting to communicate information , so that communities evolved from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but the bacteria actually can exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why for example , the reason it grows to antibiotics .
and some bacteria , as they can keep themselves from penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have plenty of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now this communication allowed to the reasons of communities , which were in some sense in the same boat ; they were more synertically .
so they either survive together either , or they continued to go together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeatedly repeatedly , and prefer by evolution of evolution .
so the transit point is now where these communities sustain so close , they decided to write the recipe for the whole community &apos;s chain on the dna .
and the next interesting period took about another billion years .
at that point , we have multiple communities , communities of many different cells , combined as a single organism .
in fact , also a multi-cell community , too .
we have a lot of cells are alone alone .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to develop , so the level of which this evolution was going on , not longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
the next step is going to these communities .
the cell communities started to discriminate information .
and they developed special structures which are nothing else to process as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structure .
so the neurons are the information processing systems that these cells have built .
they started to train in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and the monitoring of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment , a individual -- learning has happened within the course of the span of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn for example not to eat a certain fruit , because it was bad and sick , the last time he ate it .
this could be done in a single organism in the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years of evolution had to be learned by the individuals that died because of these fruits , that these information systems weren &apos;t there .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process of this special information structure , because evolution could now happen within the same individual .
it could take place within a period of educational framework .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
well as an example , the refined version of us known version of this communication is human language .
it &apos;s a pretty intriguing invention if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , pristine and confusion idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m sitting here , basically , in the end of sound , in the hope , in the idea of creating a very distinctive idea in your mind that has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take a very complicated , transforming it into sound , a sequence of sound , and creating something very complicated in the face of others .
so this allows us again as to work as a unified organism .
and what we actually did is we , the human condition , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same steps that have gone through multi-cell organisms -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data .
the invention of language , for example , was a small step in that direction .
telephone , computer , video accountability , computer , mystery , ce-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to make that information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it can also continue faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in times of microseconds .
you also have a little bit of little examples of evolution , as well , where he showed a little evolution in conanized program , right before your eyes .
so now we have a again again again .
the first steps i &apos;ve the story i told you is a billion years of years .
the next steps , like the nervous system , and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then it &apos;s as steps , like speech and so on , weighing less than a million years .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem very few decades to take .
and the process of the process feeds by itself , and it gets , i think , the steering car is the word agent is the word for it -- when something becomes reinforced .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
and i &apos;m living from the building of computers , and i know that i can use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using it , without creation in computer technology .
my current mode is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the tutoring machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking of thinking is , we think , in a certain kind of abstract level , and the machine , and the machine does something that we need to grow up , better , better and faster than we would do it be done .
and it makes it partly with the techniques that we don &apos;t even even understand properly .
so one way that &apos;s particularly interesting is that , and what i &apos;ve used in last times is evolution itself .
we put evolutionary process in the machine which is happening in microgeographic .
so to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that developed random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , a hundred million chance of random , selected by copies of instructions .
now , please run all of these random inclamation instructions , all the programs , and eventually the people who are going to pick up who are next to the next .
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to say , i want number numbers , that would be an easy example that i used for that .
find programs that can be programs that are provided by the husbands .
of course , the chance of randomly selected is very small that it &apos;s likely to be more numbers of accidents , so you don &apos;t think of the instructions actually .
but one of those may be two numbers in the right order .
now , i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequence , which i &apos;ve come up with the next .
and the rest , the rest .
now all of remains of profanment that number the numbers are best .
namely , with a method of combining recombined , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their subroutinies , and the children are cluming the properties of the subroutinies of the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that have come through combinations of programs that have come to be a little closer to report than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
sorrow again .
so if you have some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run an evolution of millions of years through the computer in a less minute computer , in more complicated times , a few hours .
finally , i get the programs that can be perfectly ambitious numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
these are rejects and strange programs .
but they did the job .
and i know , i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job , because you get from a series of thousands of thousands of programs that have done .
because their lives depended on whether she did the job .
i sat in a 747 together in a 747 with marvin minsky , and i &apos;ll find a map of it , and says , &quot; oh , look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane , from hundreds of thousands of sections , which are connected together to make their flight more secure . &quot; don &apos;t it ? &quot;
we know that a developmental process process is not optimal if it &apos;s going to be complicated .
so we begin to rely on the computer for a process which is different from classical engineering .
it allows us to give things to a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal method to produce .
yet , we don &apos;t understand the options yet .
so , it &apos;s a huge amount of momentum that technology was .
so we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer a lot faster so that we can be able to do these processes quicker .
so it creates feedback .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding by itself .
we turn off .
we &apos;ve come to a point here , which is analog to then when cell organisms have evolved to multiple sources organisms .
so we &apos;re amundingly , and we can &apos;t be able to figure out what the hell we &apos;re actually creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of this vector .
but i truly believe that after we &apos;ll do something else .
i find it very sophisticated from telling us that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think we all have part of the creation of what always comes next .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m chosen .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the top of the desert in the desert with sufi-hismuktistan ali .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the age of ancient indian times the mahabharata .
if we wanted to travel to the indians , we went out in a car and string over the sky .
now we &apos;re going on airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian warrior georarmen had an thirc , he took an arc , fired in the floor and water .
now we do we going to do this with drilling and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
this was really sad to me .
i was doing something scared about technology .
it was afraid that i could lose the ability to lose the outside love without a camera , and with my friends .
i thought technology was going to be possible and not killing .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver calculator .
this piece of 50 years old technology was the most optimistic thing for me .
she was a goldest access to a world of pirates and from random ships and to images in my imagination .
so i came up with it , as we thought we had our postcloses and the camera from dreaming .
they were allowed to become inspired .
and so i gave myself to the world of technology to see how i could use it to help them be compassionate rather than killing .
with 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling to connect on the world .
it can know how we think it is .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text together and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling has got more sense .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to khoya , an interactive privacy app .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s : &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i wrote my name .
and it &apos;s going to explain a character in the book .
and again , a letter is going down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps , where i live tomorrow -- that &apos;s true .
the child in me is really enthusiastic about this possibility .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean the magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had children .
fireflies in a jar was always very exciting to me .
that &apos;s how you &apos;ve got to dump the ipad , and leave the fireflies out .
and they opened up the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single dictionary .
and that &apos;s why every book is going to get a little sign here , and every world i &apos;m putting here into the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
so imaginative books have always maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and it opens and serves for guidance in the rest of the book .
it also shows you about other people &apos;s book .
i go in here .
also for me , it &apos;s important for me to create something that innatural is also very competitive .
these are the apsaras .
we heard all of these grains and nyilla , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsarine were caught thousands of years in indras , in an old risty book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history of children .
it &apos;s a story that comes apart with new ways , like the environmental crisis .
for the theme of environmental crisis , the last 10 years of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , in their computers without leaving out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with their technology .
in a interactions of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect with the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of storymen , rocks , otesas and scls .
somehow the children do not make more .
this is a childish of childhood is brought back . you have to go out to make a chapter one shot from a flower .
in another chapter , you have to test a piece of blueprint and tag it .
so you can actually create a digital collection of photos that you can think about online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a valve and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today today . &quot;
this creates a kind of a social network around a digital collection of photos that it actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology to each other .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you use the video of the ipads with an augmented reality , which looks like an animation that appear on a plant in front of the house .
on one point , the screen fills with pages .
you &apos;ve got to make the sound of the wind , and read them away and read the rest of the kiosks .
all of course , we move to a world where the natural technology of technology will come closer , and the magic and technology can play .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and to the magic , and the fun and the love of our childhood , through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is actually an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of the majority of my time with people in films , prisons or death cells .
i spend the most powerful ones with the most powerful ones in the social contractors and in places where there are lots of hope .
to be ted to see seeing and hear how stimulating it is , i gave myself a lot of force .
so in the short time here was clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have impact the world .
and sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets an meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matters , but the words of a committed teaching is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a careful doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household , who was dominated by a matriarchy in dominated , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a tab , strong woman , she was generating .
it had the last word in every family struggle .
she was also the origin of many ideas in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as slaves .
it was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery was very strong at the world .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hug me .
and she assumed me that i could barely breathe . then she left me .
one or two hours later , when i first came up , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , you feel another hug ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , i washed it again , &quot; when i said , &quot; yes , let me stay asleep .
her was something that made you wanted to be close to her .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i &apos;ve had to be eight or nine , that i went up to a day , and i went into living living all my cousins .
my grandmother was in the end of the room and stare at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
it went like 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came up to me , and she took me on the hand , and she said , &quot; come , bre , you and i , we need to talk .
and i remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise that you don &apos;t follow it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , wow . &quot;
she said , &quot; volunteers ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to watch you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to get only three things to me , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , henry . &quot;
and she said , first of all , i said you &apos;re going to love your mom forever .
she said , &quot; your mama is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to do with promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , henry , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , when i get next , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , i was thinking , &quot; yes , henry . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , finally , she said , the last thing you have to do is , &quot; you never will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , henry . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old south and i have a brother who &apos;s older , and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and she took this six-pile of beer with my sister and i went to the forest with us .
we were so we goofy it .
then he took a drink beer and offered my sister , and she took up , and then she took me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . make her only . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
so my brother said , &quot; well let &apos;s do that . now we do that , we do everything we do .
i had what had your sister . go , drink a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . does it just make you . &quot;
my brother staring at staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , all right ? &quot;
and he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , don &apos;t you do crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma told everybody that they &apos;re so special . &quot;
i was devastated by the floor .
i &apos;ll confk you .
i probably shouldn &apos;t .
this may be linked to the public .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i am standing that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i believe it &apos;s mobile . i say that because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around the rest that they don &apos;t think .
we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grandchildren , right ?
my grandfather was born bition in prison .
my uncle died of alcoholinduced disease .
and they believed that they were the subjects that we have to care about .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in &apos; 02 were 300,000 and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states have the highest incarceration rate in the world today .
seven million people are dropping up in currency or unconditional criminal protection .
i think of my mind have changed a mass incarcerations of our world .
in social , and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one out of three male black is 18 and 30 is in prison , in the prison , for probation , or with unconditional criminal correction .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles of philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men , in prison , in jail , on probation or with unconditioned .
now , our system isn &apos;t just sculpting to do with questions that have to do with lawsuits , it will also be done by poverty .
we have a justice in this country a justice system that treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not unification , changes the result .
but yet we seem to be very pleased with this .
a policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost memory .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are a couple of very interesting developments .
my home state of alabama is raising them out of the election when they &apos;re convicted of caring .
so here in alabama today , 34 percent of the male black population is rapidly being lost .
we predict that in 10 years , the eradication of the civil honor rights will be as high as before the vote of the vote .
the silence is , yes .
i was performing children .
a lot of the clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , covering the three-10 year-old children in jail .
in this planet , in this planet , for children , to live counselations without an ecosystem .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of procedures .
the only country in the world .
i was making people in death cells .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we think , because we &apos;ve taught it so that the true question is : has a person deserves to die for a human crime ?
that &apos;s a very clever question .
and you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view isn &apos;t : anybody deserves a crime for a crime , but , do we deserve it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death in america is defined by error .
on nine people who were executed , one that we found for innocent people who were released and had been released from death .
it was an error rate . one out of nine crashes .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , we &apos;re going to take off , take one out .
but somehow we &apos;re sort of doing it , we &apos;ve been fooled by this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m teaching my student african-american story . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of reengineering , to the beginning of the world &apos;s world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about that .
but for the african-american , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or about bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking about talks . they tell people to stop saying that we &apos;re going to be the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , no -- tell the people that we grew up .
and after the course of terrorism came to , of course , the rascrats , and decades of migrsistic motivated subcomposition and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions in historical context .
we are we started .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that is that we &apos;re not willing to get ourselves to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the rascrats is not tainted to overcome , without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were a commitment , but not in this planet .
i &apos;ve given a few talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you talking about it . &quot;
he said , &quot; there are no death in germany .
and of course , it can never give you in germany . &quot;
it &apos;s been silent . then a woman said , &quot; well , with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever going to be teaching people back to people .
it &apos;s asking us to be aware of ourselves consciously and targeted people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it feels like it was going to be feeling in a world where german state had made people , especially if they were very likely to live at all sorts of jews .
it would be intolerable .
it would be vital .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re doing people -- here &apos;s a risk for death , 11 times higher , when the victim is , when if it &apos;s black , it &apos;s the death , the sacrifices is black is black , and the victims , in the same states , living in their earth .
yet there &apos;s yet , there &apos;s this mental interconnection .
i think our identity is endangered .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult themes , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love conversation .
but eventually , these realities are comprised of suffering , abuse , complacency , exclamation , excference .
i think i &apos;m important to me both .
because we ultimately talk about it that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be in a complex world .
for me , to make the time , thinking and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the ones that will never be at ted .
but think of a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to believe that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . that &apos;s how we &apos;re rational , that we appreciate wisdom .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head of heart connection , which i believe is that it drives us not only to be open for all the light and the loved things , but for the dark and problematic and problematic .
george lav havel , the great cheanic politician , once said .
when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to have anything possible , but what we needed was most exciting , an intellectual orientation , the willingness to be at all-hopeful , witness .
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that the ted communities have to engage for it .
there are there &apos;s no exaggeration about technology and design that allows us to be completely humane , unless we have a eyes and ears for poverty , cross-border and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t consider ourselves .
it &apos;ll deeply touch .
as a young lawyer , i was very privileged to meet pink parks .
and then , again , back to cadelery again , following two of their elders &apos;s elders tractors , and the older women , in the montgunard bus -- and virginia durr , who was a white thirc , dr. ay phking durr , dr. king thirr , dr. king .
so these women were meeting and they kept themselves .
and down to call me , &quot; bryan , i said , &quot; bryan , ms. parks come into the city . we want to talk .
would you like to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , great . &quot;
and she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just stopped .
it was always as inspiring was so inspirational .
one day i was sitting there and listened to these women , and after a couple of hours turned to me in a couple of hours to tell us , &quot; now bryan , tell me what &apos;s going on is right ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to escape injustice .
wr want people who were convicted of innocent times .
we want to fight prediscrimination and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to lead to life , we want to run our workforce without an investment requirement for children .
we want to have something against death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of levers .
we want to get mass incarcerations . &quot;
and i just my normal talk , she looked at me and said , &quot; uh . mhmm . mhmm .
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , there was wearing , a woman carr put on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they must be very , very high . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be bathed .
we need to think of ways to think about these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends upon our humanity .
in my work , very simple things in my work .
i learned a couple of simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
when somebody &apos;s lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a thieve .
if you know who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s how , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and in many parts of the earth , i think , in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe in many places are the opposite of poverty justice .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , and i think so beautiful and inspiring , and so excited , we &apos;re not going to be measured at our technology , not at the things that we develop , not at our intellect and mind .
after all , a society is not measured by how they treat the rich and powerful and privileged , but in terms of them , with the poor , the proelsiaries that were incarcerated .
because in this context , we start to realize the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . one story for the end .
sometimes i press too .
i &apos;m going to tired , as we all .
sometimes , these ideas are talking about this ideas about thinking , really important way .
i painted these children who were being sentenced to very hard .
i go to the study prison , and i &apos;m going to see a client that may be 13 or 14 or 14 years old , and should be in the course of an adult .
then i ask , what could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my goodness , if an judge can turn us into something else , then he must have magic powers .
right , bryan , the judge has magic .
you should want to wish .
and because it was late , and i didn &apos;t really think that hard , i began to work on a criminal .
i had one 14-year-old , poor black boys as a client .
and i started by doing with this call . the headline was : &quot; ansign , my arms , 14-year-old , black practitioners as a privileged , white , 75-year-old characters .
in my heart , i explained that misconduct the state of the state of law and the police and the police were caring for herself .
there was a crazy line line that there &apos;s nothing more than that in this country , there are no behavior whatsoever .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know anymore if i just dreamed of that crazy , or actually wrote him .
and i didn &apos;t just , i didn &apos;t just write it , but also sent him to the court .
a few months went on and i had forgotten everything .
and finally , i decided , my god , i must give you in the court and this crazy thing .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- seriously .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that is that hard , so painful .
and finally , i went out of my car , and i went up to the stairs .
when i walked up the stairs for the dish , there was an elderly , black man , the prison champion in court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer , &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and hug me .
then he whispering my ears .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was a force .
it was a very deep into me , identity , the ability of each individual , a community , a community , to a community , a sense of hope .
well , i went into the courthouse .
when the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , have you asked this crazy thing ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started talking .
more people would come in , just because they were mad .
that i wrote these crazy things .
police officers came in and aseced in the statches and office workers .
in the turnside was full of the halls of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color languages , about poverty , about inequality .
from my view of my door , i looked down and down .
he kept up it through the window again , and he could hear the whole tohuwabodog .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very supportive flick out in the court room , and instantly put it back behind me , almost on the defense bank .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
and during the break , when the break came in , a police officer came in , and it was very troubling that the housechampion was in the court room .
this degty ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come up to say to this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t leave it .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you have figured out that the moral pendulum of the universe is far away , but that it &apos;s true of justice .
that we don &apos;t completely evolved as humans , unless we care about human rights and values .
that our survival is connected to each other with each other .
that we need our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity need to connect with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of course , i &apos;d like to look at those of you , just don &apos;t say , don &apos;t lose the destination . don &apos;t give up .
you have one of this audience , this community , a obvious wish and they &apos;ve heard to help them and do something .
what can we do yet ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are ways everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a group that spring in this spring , where it &apos;s about , actually , a really effort to repenetrate from the money stream , which is in the politics of the punishment .
for example , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to envy a billion dollars for the death penalty for the death penalty .
and yet , six percent of all the food styles don &apos;t disproportionate .
growing 56 percent of the broken cases didn &apos;t come from court .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this is a speaker is going to suggest how to invest money into more security forces and security .
i think there are places everywhere .
over the course of the last three decades , the crime rate is down enormously in america .
there &apos;s often , this is a frequent relationship with the elevated incarceration .
what would you tell anybody who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of violence has not changed .
most of the mass incarceration in this country was not really done in the classroom of violence .
it was the misguided crusade against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prison prison .
we &apos;ve exhausted from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have a three-versive pleasure , &quot; the standard laws that will always bring people behind bars , for a bicycle , for the theft of marketing , rather than that you can force them back to the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims , not less .
and i think we &apos;re going to help test the test of test philosophy for none of us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you &apos;ve really brought a string to see .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
i mean , there &apos;s a total risk of death .
famine in somalia . they had three : pepper spray of the police .
speaker 4 : spincile . &amp; lt five : dangerous stripers .
el6 : social dissettling . an7 : 65 dead dead .
lawrence ami: scenes : cyberattacks
different speakers : drug war . weapon of mass destruction . tornado .
recession : gridlock . doomday . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are accurate in the same issue .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second of every day , our senses will start more information on as our brain will ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , is the first stop position for all the information of our temporal lobes , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
it was sorting , and it &apos;s transparent the whole information on the search for every part of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for bad news .
and the old words , &quot; when it &apos;s blood , the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , seven days , the week the week , the week of the day of the day , 24 hours a day emerging all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is getting worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
well , it is .
maybe the enormous amount of progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century has done through a series of forces , so strong that it can be possible in the next three decades to create a world of separation .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , species , water -- energy problems -- that we have done .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but eventually it eventually ends up .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can anticipate the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled in inflation , which has tripled income income in the world &apos;s population .
child mortality is reduced to a tenth .
and what matters is that food , electricity production , and communication costs diminishing a lot more .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re living in a very peaceful age of human history .
and according to charles kenny &apos;s the literacy rate of 25 percent in 80 percent in 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we reredefined poverty .
if you think that a great percentage of americans who live under poverty , wasting electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , radio , or mobile phones and cars .
the richest capitalists in the last century , the empires &apos;s the earth , never would have dreamed of these luxury goods .
the basis for many of these technologies form , and they grow generic .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to make information technology on the trajectory of moore &apos;s side is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs in their pocket about a million times less and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , as usual , it &apos;s too silent -- good as bad times , war or peace , recession , depression , depression .
that &apos;s the result of faster computers to build faster computers .
it just for none of our major problems .
also , despite your logarithmic on the left-hand side , it goes up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
cloud computing , &quot; something that &apos;s talking to my friends at autodesk &quot; calculus , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , robots that enable personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , vaccination , vaccination and food materials , innovative , nano-materials &amp; lt and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer in &quot; risk &quot; ?
this was fantastic .
i once moved through the papers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s forced agent disabled . &quot;
the risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the way of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence for each owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i launched a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies in , more focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we asked the students , businesses , products and services , that can create a decade of mild people &apos;s lives by people .
think about that a group of students can impact the lives of billions of people today .
thirty years ago , this would have sounded ridiculous .
now , today , we know , dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think of it , i think about creating abundance , then i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about generating abundance of scarce pressures .
it &apos;s scarcity , as a result , and technology is a resource agent .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he was invited the king invited to the dinner .
napolera soldiers got a silver bundle , napoleon himself got gold bribe .
the king of the king was getting aluminum .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome was made of the washington note of aluminum .
even though aluminum &apos;s 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it doesn &apos;t seem to be pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and messy .
but then the technology of electrolysis was developed and made aluminum manufacturing so cheap that we use it with our disposal mentality .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet at 17,000-times more energy than we use a year .
16 terawatts of the earth all 88 is 14 .
it &apos;s not about leimness , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , for the first time , for example , the cost of solar power in india is to reduce 50 percent of the man-made stream electricity -- 8,8 rupees at 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power was about 50 percent last year .
last month , this was published with a study that shows that up to the end of this decade , in the end of the united states , the u.s. areas of solar percent per megaban oma , compared to cost about 15 cents a global average .
and if we have energy surplus , then we &apos;ll have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
remember , when carl sagan , the name of the earth &apos;s life spacecraft , when it was drawn to saturn , back in the direction of earth ?
he took a famous picture . what was it called ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet where 70 percent is covered with water .
yes , there are 27.5 percent of oil , 2 percent of the water , and we &apos;re fighting 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but here is hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
and these are new strains on the path , kibera materials .
and from a conversation today with dean cairo , one of the innovators of the possibility of it himself , i would like to share with you -- and he gave me permission -- his technologgy , the slingingeit &quot; slingingingdish , and that many of you may have heard , and it has the size of a refrigerator surge of a refrigerator .
it can produce a thousand liters of clean drinking water per day out of different sources -- whether saline , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the director of coca-cola has just demonstrated a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if all goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , so coca-cola is using this technology global in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology voluntary saving innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones too .
oh , we &apos;re my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent reduction rate of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a masi tor with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya , a better mobile communications communications than president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look at google mobile phones , they have more access to know and information than president clinton in 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in its abundance , as no one ever could have predicted .
and it gets better , the things that you and i spend tens of thousands of dollars -- gps , hd video , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics , technology for medical diagnostics -- now become materialized and cheaper in their mobile phone .
and the best thing about this is what happens to us in health .
last month , i had the pleasure , with the harly foundation foundation that wrote &quot; $ 10 million racides &apos;s x .
we challenge teams around the world , all these technologies connect to each other in a mobile phone , so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s an ai , you can test in or its blood or your .
and to win , the device requires a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden , and 1.3 percent of the aid of health .
when this device sequence a rna- or a dna virus , it &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the health phone and prevents a pandemic of its erupting .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just stumbled out the seven-billion brand .
and the way , by the way , the largest impact against a population explosion is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had now connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we enter two to five billion internet users .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before have to connect the global communications .
what does these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are you going to desire ?
and instead of doing , of economic gridlock , i see one of the great economic anters of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier with the tricoders , and they &apos;re getting trained through the khan-academy academy , and by doing that they &apos;re going to use the possibility , 3d printers and 3-d computing and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can we bring three billion growing , healthy , educated , educated member of the human community ?
like , with a piece of new , never-deaf voices .
how would it be the oppressed , where are they always giving them a voice to make attention to make change and make change , for the first time ?
what are going to these three billion people ?
so , how about performances that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned from the x prize is that little teams that are motivated by happiness and focused , strategizing , extraordinary things , things that can be large corporations and governments only in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that might be familiar with you .
it &apos;s a game called verification .
it was developed at the university of washington in d.c .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
we can we can we predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so that was a problem for supersupercomputer .
and this game was played by university angeles , etc .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who play the game online .
and it showed that , today , the human pattern detection of the pattern is improving the proteins as the best supercomputer .
and when these guys came and looked at who &apos;s the best commodity in the world , this wasn &apos;t a professor , no calan centigrade student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked as a buddhist hospital at a buddhist hospital , and at night , the best of protein of the best .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to confront the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital of the technologies of non-aids .
and we &apos;ve got three billion new heads that we can work on online with the new challenges , and to do that , and to do .
we expect a few decades .
thank you .
i think we need to be doing something against a transformational piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , when i can allow it to give me a piece of my own false preconceptions to allow this .
and before i get to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the seasonal season , and we move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball is soon coming out and turns around the statistics and to make a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to tell myself to a particle that i hope that most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the average achievement of the dog .
we talk about 300 , if a bat is 300 .
that means that the players beat down three of 10 attacks .
this is called the ball of the outside field , and it &apos;s coming up , it won &apos;t be trapped , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball at the first it didn &apos;t get it in time , and the plate was in safety .
three out of 10 .
you know how to call a 30000th nut ?
good , really good , maybe a no-star .
you know how to call a 4500 ?
that &apos;s one that &apos;s safe in the rest of 10 .
legendary ancient , like ted williams , legendary contemporary baseball players who met over 400 times over 400 times .
let &apos;s switch back to my world in medicine , which i feel for a lot of kindness , or maybe a little less likely i &apos;ve been talking to you about it .
suppose you have a blind darker , and you &apos;ll overprompt to an operateur that is the average performance in terms of blind .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine , if you live life in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved person with clogging heart ccale , you know , you know , you know , you know , with a cardiologist , whose average psychologists , whose average performance at 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the rising rise .
and she beat a 257 .
somehow , that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
what do you think like the average performance for an electroist or a nurse or an orthopcian , a nigerian spouse , a rescue mate ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one &apos;s going to know in the whole medicine , which should be a good surgeon or a doctor , or rescue .
well , what we do is we &apos;re going to do all of you , including me , locked into the world with being very perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s going to believe about the details of how to do that .
and this is the news i recorded in medical school .
i was a forced assistant instructor .
in high school times , a student said that brian goldman would learn for a bleeding test .
and it did .
and i learned in my little flick in my young roof , and the nurse at the republican hospital , rather far from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomieters , i learned the origins and the downs of each mush , each other branch of each other , which leads to the aorta , the shelter and ordinary basic diagnostics .
i knew even the default diagnosis to classify debubuanacs .
and i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , so i went off with ccret .
and i left that medical school with the impression that , if i memorized everything , and all that knew , or as much as possible , as close as possible as possible as possible , i was immun against the power of mistakes .
and it worked for a time to get until i met the woman printer .
i was more resistant to a hospital here in toronto , as a woman printer , brought me into the emergency department of the hospital .
at that point , i was rejected the cardiological layer in the genetic service .
and it was my mission to do when the emergency person of the cardiological council sought to study the emergency patient .
to give feedback to my top doctor .
i picked up wife printer , and she was breathing breathing .
and when i heard her , she made stupid noises .
and when i heard their chest from the stethoscars , i was able to hear a broken sound on both sides , which said that under congesting heart failure .
this is a condition where the heart of the heart is failing , instead of pumping the entire blood , it turns out a part in the lung , and filling it together , and it &apos;s the short .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard thing to do .
i hired them and made me for treatment .
i gave her aspiration . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water pill , so that they decided to run the fluid .
and over a year period and a half to two hours , they began to feel better .
i felt really good .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them to talk to you with my top doctor .
i didn &apos;t take it on and did what i should have been , what was going to have been a call on my wedding doctor , so that he would have had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew that he would be able to help navigate her information .
maybe i did the good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s help .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and taking his responsibility so that i was so upset , and so i would be able to make care of my patients without worrying about it .
my second mistake was worse .
and so that , i sent them home , i shed a silent voice to me , and i was trying to say , &quot; well , i don &apos;t do a good idea . you don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it lacked me so much in confident that i asked the nurse , which was worth of a woman printer , &quot; believe it &apos;s okay if you &apos;re going home home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and she said , &quot; well , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it as though it was yesterday .
so i underdrew the tacking platform and a medical community and rescue , and they brought them home .
and i got back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this bird feeling in my stomach .
but i continued .
and at the end of the day , i was packing my stuff , and i went to the hospital and went to the parking lot of the car when i was i didn &apos;t do something that i had otherwise .
i went to go home from the emergency room .
and there was a different nurse , not the nurse who had seen the after woman printer , but another three words to me and these three words are afraid of the most emergency scientist that i know .
other medical professionals also fear this , but the emergency medicine is particularly special , because we only see the patient as the patient &apos;s eye .
the three words : remember , remember ?
do you remember the patients they sensed at home ?
asked the nurse asked .
&quot; so she says , &quot; she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular sound .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour she returned home , after i pursued her home , and she paused , and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistant them back to the emergency station of 50 percent of 50 , which is a dangerous rule .
she was barely was breathing and was blue .
the emergency person and nurses were raised all strands .
they put blood pressure up .
they put them on a ventilated machine .
i was shocked and thrown down into the inside .
and i became living this axis because she came to the wire , and i was hoping that she was going to recover .
and after two , three days , it &apos;s been clear that she would never wake again .
it had suffered an unconditive brain damage .
their family brought themselves .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves frowning .
at the new days day , they were going to take them -- ms. printer , a woman and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of them die .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next weeks i tweed , and i first found the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , in isolation , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you cannot speak with the colleagues about it .
you all know healthy shame , if you give a mystery of the best friend &apos;s game , even though this one on wiinor and you &apos;ll get caught and the best friend gets an awful , when one is a terrible when one at the end is the bad conscience , and you &apos;re a little bit that you never make a mistake .
when you make rebenign , and never make the mistakes again .
that &apos;s the kind of teaching shame .
and the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the ones that makes you in the eye .
it &apos;s the one that says that that doesn &apos;t mean what you &apos;ve done is bad , but that you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t at the republican of the doctor ; he was very pleased .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he was going to skip and safe that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i went to these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why did i go home ?
and then in my worst moments , how did i make such a dumb mistake ?
why did i went into medicine ?
slowly , slowly it did .
i started feeling better .
and then on a shredder day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun collapsed , and i could maybe feel better again .
and i was separated me that if i separated my efforts on perfection , and never began to make a mistake , that the voice might be silent .
and she did .
and i continued .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i was training in the emergency hospital , north of toronto , north of toronto , and i calculated a 25-year old man with gifted rags .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
he just showed it up .
i looked into the raves , and it was a little pink pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him out .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed up his raves .
two days later , i came to my next acute care , and my chever rushed on a conversation in her office .
and they said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patient &apos;s patient doing you ? &quot;
it turns out that he catched a traptocock infection .
it had an potential , potentially , dangerous disease called the eglottis .
you can be gooze that , but it &apos;s not an infection from raater , but the upper sports range , and causes the respiratory lanes .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got multiculous anbotica and a few days later .
and i went back again through the same edition of shame and self-doubt , and i kept devastated , and i went back to the work until it went back and over again and again and again .
in an emergency section , i have overseen a blind gut mentor .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially if you think that you work in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i would not send them home , and there &apos;s no shortage of deprivation either .
i would i thought he had kidney stones .
and i did the test out of the kidneys . when it was without disfunded , my colleague , at the back of the patient , the patient was a blurry in the lower right-hand sector in the lower right-hand sector , and he called the operators .
the other was strong diarrhea .
i went to investigate to rehyf , and i asked my colleagues to evaluate him as well .
and he did , and when he confessed a confirmation in the lower area , he called the operators .
and in both cases in both cases , and it was good for them .
both of me nailed them , please .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake has happened in the first five years , which is why many of my colleagues suggest , but total nonsense .
some of my clones happened in the last five years .
by itself alone , shame and without support .
is the problem : if i can finish up with my fault and i can talk about you , if i hear the silent voice that tells you know , how can &apos;t be able to be able to share my colleagues ?
how can i teach my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when have you heard the last time of someone who &apos;s been talking about grilled ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about any doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was to ask in a room with colleagues and ask her immediate support and tell you what i &apos;ve just been told to you , i &apos;d been told to you , i &apos;m very likely to end to end the end of course would be really awkward , anybody would have a funny , and forgotten , forget about the issue the rest .
and in fact , in fact , if i knew my colleagues , that a orthopedite in my hospital would have given someone wrong leg , and then they would have to look at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there is two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes , and those who don &apos;t do , and those who are limited constrains , and less compromises that govern with bad outcomes .
it &apos;s almost an ideal response as an antibodies that attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that , if we connected those , the mistakes from medicine combined that we have a safe system system .
but there are two problems .
in my approximately 20 years of medical consciousness and journalism , i created a personal medical study on medical error and wrong treatment for all of my first of my first article for my first wrote for the toronto star to my show , &quot; white , black style . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unheartenable .
we &apos;re working in a system where we &apos;re going to happen every day mistakes in which one in 10 media is either is either a false , or false , in the hospital infections , is going to be more expensive and getting dead .
in that state , about 24,000 acres , they die of regenerative mistakes .
in the united states , the institute has deciphering the number of 100,000 dollars .
both of these are strong subproof , because we don &apos;t consider the problem of how we should .
and it &apos;s the ones .
in a hospital system in that medical system , medical wisdom is doubled all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect disease course for a patient pain .
then i take the same patient with chest pain , and stretch it up and smashed it slightly slightly smoply breath , and suddenly it goes through a sudden and suddenly the story .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things anywhere .
and my patients are not cars ; they tell me their symptoms forever in the same way .
all of these rely is inevitable .
so , if you take the system , as i &apos;ve taught it , and all of these things were done in error health research , then at the end is no longer left .
and you know the laws about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my program , black is black , black , i said , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each from the author of the cardiologists , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and then , what about your microphone ? &quot; and then i
and then their pups , they were found in front of the head , then watch them , and they &apos;re very heavy , and they start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want their stories to share .
you want to be able to say to be able to say , &quot; look , not the same mistake that i factory . &quot;
what they need is a environment that is being replicated to it .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new condefined is a human being concerned about its humanity , accept it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s going to learn from them so that it can be passed .
they share their experiences with others .
they supported when others to talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other mistakes other mistakes , not in order , but in a affective , supportive , supportive way that benefit .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that is so , people make mistakes out of time .
so the system that the system is developing in tofu cups that makes it easier to find mistakes that are inevitable , and it &apos;s also enable people respond to the skills that health care , in which everyone who are causing potential mistakes the potential mistake , and in particular , and that particular things , to be able to do that , in particular , to make me , to get their mistakes the mistakes , in
my name is brian american .
i &apos;m the redefined director .
i am a person . i do mistakes .
i persist , but i &apos;m trying to learn how to learn from it to give it to others .
i &apos;m not sure what you think of me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about transformational standards values .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , it was 1835 .
you might think he cried , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as very common .
it was a grouper .
until the 1980s , the &apos; 80s , he was fished in great style .
he &apos;s now on the red list of endangered species .
we heard about this story , we heard many times of the galapagos islands , or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we &apos;re still coming onto the galapagos islands .
we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re originally .
it &apos;s also describing the browing you &apos;re still described as untouched .
so what happened here ?
the second story is to make a different concept , the transformational boreal .
because i &apos;ve seen it when i was in southern africa , in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sunfire , and i realized that i didn &apos;t really get from there .
it was my first sunfire .
as you can see , the lalaver of palms , and a couple of acres went around .
there were colored colder from about 20 inches , black pnaces , a understate of the buntbeard .
the fish of these colorful barks were very fragmented , and the fishermen lived very well and compressed in ghana on average .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was cut on half of his size .
they &apos;ve got five centimeters .
they were genetically lit .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had good to be there .
so it changed , and it changed everything .
my third little story told me about my terhood at the introduction of tour fishing in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , in the &apos; 70s , at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , europe has many development projects .
so , funded countries that were already 100 fish , the industrial fishing catch this rather ugly ship called the most flexible ship .
i went on it , and we went to the entire southern south sea and especially in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
and i know that it was the reason of the sea .
90 percent percent of our subscribers were devastating , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots in the rubble there , the rubs , were coral reefs fish .
essentially , the cause of the ocean was thrown back on the deck and then thrown back .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very quick .
within a year , you take a tracking line and then start with the commercial fish .
the reason is going to change . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a hard thing , or soft corals get a matky crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , you &apos;d get it away because they were dead .
we started an experience .
she wasn &apos;t upset yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of rubs is collected every time of fishing when they drive in areas that have never been frozen .
but it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our standards in the new level , and we don &apos;t call ourselves what there was .
now if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green cell cells , the water supply .
at the time it changes . it changes , because for humans , their actions are all natural .
every generation is looking at the generation , the images that you consider at the beginning of their conscious life , as opposed to the present .
the difference is seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be able to sequence of changes .
and at the end , you can only want to get the inherited record .
so that &apos;s where our goal now .
we want to get things that disappeared or things that aren &apos;t more like they were .
you could think that this think that the problem that people were doing is they were killing in the contaminated societies , killing animals , and only about a few generations that they had done .
because obviously an animal becomes an animal that existed very often , except before it dies .
so , you lose a common species of animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a huge loss .
at the time we &apos;re focused on the large animals , and in the sea , that &apos;s the great fish .
they &apos;re going to be less , because we &apos;re catching them .
there &apos;s time , little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the standard level .
the question is why to embrace the people .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , researchers , say it was really different .
they &apos;re going to tell it , because the evidence , as they were in an previous form , aren &apos;t the way they &apos;d like to put the evidence the evidence .
for instance , for example , there &apos;s anecdotes that the report of a representative fishing report that observed in this neighborhood can &apos;t be used to be used to be used , not be used by fishing , because they usually , because it &apos;s not &quot; science . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in teams , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous great big role that could play an oil reserve .
because by ocean-protected areas , we basically have the past .
we &apos;re starting to the past people who can &apos;t understand the people , because they have changed standards , and they &apos;re very low .
and so the people who are seeing a marine reserve , and they can benefit from the insight that allow them back their standards .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west for example ?
so , here , i think art and the film might fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the diagram of chesapeake bay .
it was 2,000 years ago -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and shrolls may remind you &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched about it -- besides the pohomati &apos;s child history , why were they touched by the photo ?
because it &apos;s something called a wake that &apos;s been lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give is , is called cameron , with which he is turning &quot; avatar ii &quot; underneath water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist eastern germany , when you had a typewriter when you had a typewriter , that was based on the government .
they also had to sign a piece of video of this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could follow back where a text came .
they found an article with faloriginal thought , they were able to track out the creators of this thought .
and we didn &apos;t see in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do that , and how much the rhetoric would be counted .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if you buy a new color printer in 2011 today , you print a series of laser printing tape , and you print a page , this side yellow yellow blob on each page , in a pattern , clearly sticking out the page and trace your printer .
this is what happens today .
and that nobody seems to carry up there .
and that was an example of what our own governments about the technology against us , the citizens , use .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing online problems today .
let &apos;s see what really happens on the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
we have online criminals .
so for example , this is mr. dimitri golry in bav in ukraine .
and the legal criminals , online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to earn much money , a huge pile of money .
there are several well-known cases of online million , multimillion million people who &apos;ve made their money through attacks .
this is wfich tsastsin from the tartu in estland .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watt .
bjweaom .
this is matthew anderson , the dr al-dar and so on and on .
these people have gone up online , but they were illegally acquired by the name of skjan to steal money from our bank bank , while we took our online banking , or also , or keylogger , who have collected our credit card information on the keyboard on the keyboard , as a infected computers online .
the u.s. service , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account was 14.9 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on top feet , it &apos;s not unknown at random .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that today , it &apos;s more likely to become victims of an online course than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be only worse .
in the future , most crime is going to play online .
the second largest abnormal group we see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re about something else , protests , an opinion , or by your audience .
and groups like anonymous are both over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the main players on the online attacks .
so these are the three main pieces of people : criminals , the ones that make money for money because of the hackers exchange , their anonymous ones , who are providing resistance , but the last group are nations , and nations that attacks the attacks .
we &apos;re where we are cases , like the dieininotar .
it shows an unprecedented thing that happens when governments attacking their own citizens .
diginototar is a full-matics certified from the netherlands -- or it was this .
in the last fall , it had to sign it , because temperininar had been hacked .
someone had broken up , and it had a system to mess .
and last week in a meeting at dutch government , i asked one of these groups of whether it was possible for possible , that because of the temperes , people died .
and his answer was yes .
well , how do people die in a series of a hair like this ?
diginets is a certified .
they sell certified certified .
what do you do with the ananates ?
well , if you need a certificate , if you have a website with your anonymous book , with a sl--encrypted encryptant , for instance gmail .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of them -- but these services are particularly prevalent in totalitarian states like iran , where they can use them know that they can perceive more trust than local voices , and that they don &apos;t take on ssl connections , so that local government can &apos;t snilt .
so , can you , if you put yourself in a foreign age .
you can buy certified with the prescription and the fake certification .
and this is what happened in diginypar .
how about the arab spring and things that have happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the insurist in april , 2011 the chief headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folding was called &quot; goodbye . &quot;
and in this folder , there were notes of germany in germany who had sold the egyptian government for a few programs that they were able to catch up with very high , very large communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the minister of m.p. is right here .
so western governments feed totalitarian governments with help , so that they can do against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves themselves .
for example , in germany , only a couple of weeks ago , the founders of state of state was found , and this was a trojan who was used to a trojan who was used by stuffed their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a crime , it &apos;s almost safe to be the phone .
but today , we &apos;re far beyond this .
they tap their internet connection .
they use , using the means , like the state of the state of the state , to play your computer with a rajan , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , listen to their online debates , their uncle words .
so if we think about those things like this , then the obvious answer to people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t be because i &apos;m a brown citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not about the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we like today , in 2011 , in the year of 2011 , our governments may be trusted , and every one we &apos;re going to be able to be thrown for forever .
and trust us , we trust them blind to every future government , a government we may have become 50 years ?
these are the questions we need to address the next 50 years .
you might seem strange about it , but i &apos;m a big fan of measuring stones .
the first concrete mark stones were made in 1868 , and they raised a very simple idea : using the reserves that fit together .
and concrete tiles have been the most sophisticated construction unit in the world .
they put us into building things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the accent was the block of building in the building .
nearly a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s called the mandatory rock .
and within less years , lego in each household went .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced , or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create nice houses or nice bridges or nice building .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego has basically taken the concrete block in the world in the world , and taken a building block for our imagination .
meanwhile , bell , bell labs was announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit , which led us from a world of bartical , stacking building blocks into a world that was accessible .
as the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex loops , which is a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is at experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i began to develop littism .
so let me show you how they work .
littvism are electronic panels that have specific function .
they &apos;re prejustified , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magnets .
you can &apos;t put them back together .
the stones are color rates .
green is a copy , blue is power , pink is one-eyed and orange is wires .
so all you need to do is to connect a blue and an green one , and you can build very rapidly bigger distances .
you add a blue one , you can make light .
you can put a switch in between and so you &apos;ve created a little dimmer .
take the switch out around a pulsmote , which is here , and you &apos;ve done a little blind .
you add this guy for for an extra effect , and they created a sound engine .
i will stop that .
beyond the simple game , littism is actually fairly sustainable .
rather than coding that you need to program , or cursed , it allows lip lifts to you with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to get your breath down or slow down or slow it down this button , it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind littism is is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a commodity fashion .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve sequenced littantity &apos;s children , and you see them play .
and it was an incredible experience .
the beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electronics that surround you in the daily world , and not learn them in school .
as for example , how a night light , or why the door to the doors , or respond to the doors , or respond to a ipod .
we brought birth to design education also to design education .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things , which started playing with littism as a material .
here we see here with files , paper and water bottles , like george ...
a few weeks ago , we brought birth to risd , and we gave them a couple of designers that had no technical experience , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power .
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a movement controlled conpowered consonic kanone .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer out of dough that &apos;s fear in the darkness .
for these non-engineers , littism is another material , electronics was just one more material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so littity is open source .
you can go to the website , you can break down all the design and make it yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventors of honor to encourage , because the world that we live in which we live , this interactive world , is listening to us .
so , pull out and start to invent .
thank you .
