$ 10,000 gold ?
s@@ an fran@@ c@@ isco – it has never been easy to have a rational convers@@ ation about the value of gold .
lat@@ ely , with gold prices up more than 300 % over the last decade , it is harder than ever .
just last dec@@ ember , fellow economists mar@@ tin fel@@ d@@ stein and no@@ ur@@ iel rou@@ bin@@ i each p@@ enn@@ ed op-@@ eds bra@@ vely ques@@ tioning bul@@ l@@ ish market sen@@ timent , sensi@@ bly pointing out gold ’ s risks .
w@@ ouldn ’ t you know it ?
since their articles appeared , the price of gold has moved up still further .
gold prices even hit a record@@ -@@ high $ 1,@@ 300 recently .
last dec@@ ember , many gold bugs were argu@@ ing that the price was inevitably headed for $ 2@@ ,000 .
now , em@@ bol@@ dened by continuing appreciation , some are sugge@@ sting that gold could be headed even higher than that .
one successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices langu@@ ished for a more than a decade before the dow j@@ ones index cross@@ ed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980 ’ s .
since then , the index has climb@@ ed above 10,000 .
now that gold has cross@@ ed the magic $ 1,000 barrier , why can ’ t it increase ten-@@ fold , too ?
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the lea@@ p of imagination that it seems .
after adju@@ sting for inflation , today ’ s price is no@@ where near the all-@@ time high of jan@@ u@@ ary 1980 .
back then , gold hit $ 8@@ 50 , or well over $ 2@@ ,000 in today ’ s dollars .
but jan@@ u@@ ary 1980 was argu@@ ably a “ fre@@ ak peak ” during a period of hei@@ gh@@ tened ge@@ o-@@ political instability .
at $ 1,@@ 300 , today ’ s price is probably more than double very long-term , infl@@ ation-@@ adjusted , average gold prices .
so what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here ?
one answer , of course , is a complete collapse of the us dollar .
with so@@ aring deficits , and a ru@@ d@@ der@@ less fiscal policy , one does wonder whether a popul@@ ist administration might reck@@ lessly turn to the printing press .
and if you are really worried about that , gold might indeed be the most reliable he@@ dge .
sure , some might argue that infl@@ ation-@@ inde@@ xed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation he@@ dge than gold .
but gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances .
in fact , as car@@ men rein@@ hart and i discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises , this time is different , c@@ ash@@ -@@ stra@@ pped governments will often for@@ ci@@ bly convert inde@@ xed debt to non-@@ inde@@ xed debt , precisely so that its value might be infl@@ ated away .
even the united states ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated index@@ ation clauses in bond contracts during the great de@@ pression of the 1930 ’ s . so it can happen anywhere .
even so , the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it prob@@ able , so one should be cau@@ tious in argu@@ ing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations .
some have argued instead that gold ’ s long up@@ ward mar@@ ch has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and specul@@ ate in gold .
there is probably some slight truth – and also a certain degree of ir@@ ony – to this argument .
after all , medieval al@@ chem@@ ists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold .
w@@ ouldn ’ t it be parado@@ x@@ ical , then , if financial al@@ chem@@ y could make an ing@@ ot of gold worth dramatically more ?
in my view , the most powerful argument to justify today ’ s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of a@@ sia , l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , and the middle east into the global economy .
as legi@@ ons of new consumers gain purchasing power , demand inevitably rises , driving up the price of scar@@ ce commodities .
at the same time , emerg@@ ing-@@ market central banks need to accumul@@ ate gold reserves , which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich@@ -@@ country central banks . with the euro looking less appe@@ tiz@@ ing as a diversification play away from the dollar , gold ’ s appeal has naturally grown .
so , yes , there are solid fundament@@ als that argu@@ ably support today ’ s higher gold price , although it is far more debat@@ able whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future .
indeed , another critical fundamental factor that has been su@@ sta@@ ining high gold prices might prove far more eph@@ emer@@ al than globalization .
gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest@@ -@@ rate movements .
after all , gold pays no interest and even costs something to store .
today , with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries , it is relatively cheap to specul@@ ate in gold instead of investing in bonds .
but if real interest rates rise significantly , as well they might some@@ day , gold prices could pl@@ um@@ met .
most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to pre@@ dict over the short to medium term , with the od@@ ds of gains and losses being roughly in balance .
it is therefore dangerous to extra@@ pol@@ ate from short-term trends .
yes , gold has had a great run , but so , too , did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago .
if you are a high-@@ net@@ -@@ worth investor , a sovereign wealth fund , or a central bank , it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a he@@ dge against extreme events .
but , despite gold ’ s hei@@ gh@@ tened all@@ ure in the wake of an extraordinary run@@ -up in its price , it remains a very ris@@ ky bet for most of us .
of course , such considerations might have little influence on prices .
what was true for the al@@ chem@@ ists of y@@ ore remains true today : gold and reason are often difficult to re@@ conci@@ le .
19@@ 29 or 1989 ?
par@@ is – as the economic crisis deep@@ ens and wi@@ dens , the world has been searching for historical analo@@ gi@@ es to help us understand what has been happening .
at the start of the crisis , many people lik@@ ened it to 1982 or 1973 , which was re@@ ass@@ uring , because both dates refer to classical cyc@@ lical down@@ turns .
today , the mood is much gri@@ mmer , with references to 19@@ 29 and 19@@ 31 beginning to abo@@ und , even if some governments continue to be@@ have as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional .
the tendency is either excessive restra@@ int ( europ@@ e ) or a diff@@ u@@ sion of the effort ( the united states ) .
europ@@ e is being cau@@ tious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro , whereas the us has moved on many fron@@ ts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms .
for ge@@ o-@@ strateg@@ ists , however , the year that naturally comes to mind , in both politics and economics , is 1989 .
of course , the fall of the house of leh@@ man bro@@ thers has nothing to do with the fall of the ber@@ lin wall .
indeed , on the surface it seems to be its perfect anti@@ thesis : the collapse of a wall symbo@@ liz@@ ing op@@ pression and artificial divisions ver@@ sus the collapse of a seem@@ ingly inde@@ struc@@ tible and re@@ ass@@ uring institution of financial capitalism .
yet 2008-@@ 2009 , like 1989 , may very well correspond to an e@@ po@@ ch@@ al change , whose un@@ fol@@ ding consequences will be felt for decades .
the end of the e@@ ast-@@ west ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points .
and what happens in 2009 may jeop@@ ardi@@ ze some of the positive results of 1989 , including the peaceful re@@ unification of europ@@ e and the tri@@ ump@@ h of democratic principles over nation@@ alist , if not xenopho@@ bic , tenden@@ cies .
in 1989 , liberal democracy tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed over the socialist ideology inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ated and promoted by the so@@ vi@@ et blo@@ c .
for many of his supporters , it was president ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an who , with his deliber@@ ate escal@@ ation of the arms race , pushed the so@@ vi@@ et economy to the br@@ ink , thereby fully demonstrating the sup@@ eri@@ ority of liberal societies and free markets .
of course , there are obvious differences between 1989 and now .
first , and perhaps above all , the revolu@@ tions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the so@@ vi@@ et union put an end to global bi@@ pol@@ arity .
by contrast , 2009 is likely to pa@@ ve the way to a new form of bi@@ pol@@ arity , but with ch@@ ina sub@@ stit@@ uting for the so@@ vi@@ et union .
second , whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989 , it is difficult in 2009 , with the spread of the global crisis , to distinguish winners from lo@@ sers .
everyone seems to be a loser , even if some are more affected than others .
yet , history is unfair , and the us , despite its greater responsibility for today ’ s global crisis , may emerge in better shape than most countries from the mor@@ ass .
in better shape , but not alone .
as a visiting professor at har@@ v@@ ard and mit , i am getting a good pre@@ view of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes .
one senses something like the making of an ameri@@ can@@ -@@ asi@@ an dominated universe .
from the incredible media la@@ b at mit to the mathemati@@ cs and economics departments at har@@ v@@ ard , asi@@ ans – chin@@ ese and indi@@ ans , in particular – are everywhere , like the roman@@ s in ath@@ ens in the first century b@@ c : full of ad@@ mir@@ ation for those from whom they were learning so much , and whom they would overcome in the coming decades .
but before this new order appears , the world may be faced with spreading dis@@ order , if not ou@@ tri@@ ght cha@@ os .
what , for example , will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as eg@@ yp@@ t when hundred of thousands of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans working in the g@@ ulf are forced to return to their hom@@ eland as a result of the crisis in the o@@ il-@@ producing countries ?
when the rich get less rich , the poor get poorer .
and what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “ europ@@ ean dream ” and are now faced with potential explo@@ sions of xenophobia in europ@@ e ’ s sup@@ pose@@ dly open countries ?
the consequences of 1989 ended up being less en@@ during than many observers , including me , would have assumed .
we can only hope that , in the end , the consequences of 2009 simil@@ arly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intui@@ tively and in our historical refle@@ xes – feel them to be .
the end of 1945
new y@@ or@@ k – on may 8 , 1945 , when world war ii in europ@@ e officially ended , much of the world lay in ruins .
but if the human capacity for destruction knows few limits , the ability to start over again is just as remarkable .
perhaps that is why man@@ kind has so far managed to survive .
no doubt , millions of people at the end of the war were too hung@@ ry and exhau@@ sted to do anything much beyond staying alive .
but , at the same time , a wave of ide@@ alism swe@@ pt across the w@@ reck@@ age , a collective sense of determination to build a more equal , peaceful , and safer world .
that is why the war ’ s great her@@ o , win@@ ston chur@@ chill , was voted out of office in the summer of 1945 , even before jap@@ an s@@ urr@@ en@@ dered .
men and women had not ris@@ ked their lives simply to return to the old days of class privi@@ lege and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
they wanted better housing , education , and free health care for all .
similar demands were heard all over europ@@ e , where the anti-@@ n@@ az@@ i or anti-@@ fasc@@ ist resistance was often led by le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts , or indeed commun@@ ists , and pre@@ war con@@ servatives were frequently tain@@ ted by collaboration with fasc@@ ist regimes .
there was talk of revolution in countries such as fran@@ ce , ital@@ y , and gre@@ ece .
this did not happen , because neither the western allies nor the so@@ vi@@ et union supported it .
stal@@ in was content to settle for an emp@@ ire in eastern europ@@ e .
but even char@@ les de gau@@ lle , a resistance leader of the right , had to accept commun@@ ists in his first post@@ war government , and he agreed to nation@@ alize industries and banks .
the s@@ wing to the left , to soci@@ al-@@ democratic welfare states , occurred all over western europ@@ e .
it was part of the 1945 consensus .
a different kind of revolution was taking place in europ@@ e ’ s former colon@@ ies in a@@ sia , where native peoples had no desire to be ruled once more by western powers , which had been so ign@@ om@@ ini@@ ously defe@@ ated by jap@@ an .
vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese , in@@ don@@ esi@@ ans , fi@@ lip@@ inos , bur@@ m@@ ese , indi@@ ans , and mal@@ ays wanted their freedom , too .
these aspirations were often voic@@ ed in the united nations , founded in 1945 .
the un , like the dream of europ@@ ean unity , was also part of the 1945 consensus .
for a short while , many prominent people – al@@ bert ein@@ stein , for one – believed that only a world government would be able to ensure global peace .
this dream quickly f@@ aded when the cold war divided the world into two hosti@@ le b@@ loc@@ s . but in some ways the 1945 consensus , in the west , was strengthened by cold war politics .
commun@@ ism , still wra@@ pped in the lau@@ rel lea@@ f of anti-@@ fasc@@ ism , had a wide intellectual and emotional appeal , not only in the so-called third world , but also in western europ@@ e .
social democracy , with its promise of greater equality and opportunities for all , served as an ideological anti@@ do@@ te .
most social democ@@ rats were in fact fi@@ erc@@ ely anti-@@ communist .
today , 70 years later , much of the 1945 consensus no longer survi@@ ves .
few people can muster great enthusiasm for the un .
the europ@@ ean dream is in crisis .
and the post-@@ war soci@@ al-@@ democratic welfare state is being ero@@ ded more and more every day .
the rot began during the 1980s , under ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an and mar@@ gare@@ t th@@ at@@ cher .
neo@@ liber@@ als attacked the expense of entit@@ lement programs and the vest@@ ed interests of trade unions .
citizens , it was thought , had to become more self-@@ reli@@ ant ; government welfare programs were making everyone soft and dependent .
in th@@ at@@ cher ’ s famous words , there was no such thing as “ society , ” only families and individuals who ought to be taking care of themselves .
but the 1945 consensus was dealt a much greater b@@ low precisely when we all re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the collapse of the so@@ vi@@ et emp@@ ire , the other great twen@@ ti@@ eth@@ -@@ century ty@@ ran@@ ny .
in 1989 , it looked as if the dark legacy of world war ii , the ens@@ la@@ vement of eastern europ@@ e , was finally over .
and in many ways , it was .
but much else collap@@ sed with the so@@ vi@@ et model .
social democracy lost its ra@@ ison d ’ ê@@ tre as an anti@@ do@@ te to commun@@ ism .
all forms of le@@ f@@ ti@@ st ideology – indeed , everything that sm@@ acked of collective ide@@ alism – came to be viewed as mis@@ guided ut@@ op@@ i@@ anism that could lead only to the gu@@ lag .
neo@@ liber@@ alism filled the vacuum , creating vast wealth for some people , but at the expense of the ideal of equality that had emerged from world war ii . the extraordinary reception of th@@ om@@ as pi@@ ket@@ ty ’ s capital in the twenty-@@ first century shows how ke@@ en@@ ly the consequences of the collapse of the left have been felt .
in recent years , other ide@@ ologies have also emerged to fill the human need for collective ide@@ als .
the rise of right-@@ wing popul@@ ism reflects revi@@ ved year@@ nings for pure national communities that keep immigrants and minorities out .
and , per@@ ver@@ sely , ameri@@ can neo-@@ con@@ servatives have transformed the internation@@ alism of the old left by seeking to impose a democratic world order by us military force .
the answer to these alarming developments is not no@@ stal@@ gia .
we cannot simply return to the past .
too much has changed .
but a new aspir@@ ation toward social and economic equality , and international solidarity , is badly needed .
it cannot be the same as the 1945 consensus , but we would do well , on this anniversary , to remember why that consensus was for@@ ged in the first place .
ber@@ lin – the global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 was the greatest economic stres@@ s-@@ test since the great de@@ pression , and the greatest challenge to social and political systems since world war ii .
it not only put financial markets and currencies at risk ; it also exposed serious regulatory and governance shortcomings that have yet to be fully addressed .
in fact , the 2008 crisis will most likely be remember@@ ed as a water@@ shed moment , but not because it led to reforms that strengthened economic re@@ sili@@ ence and removed vulner@@ abilities .
on the contrary , leaders ’ failure to disc@@ ern , much less act on , the lessons of the great recession may open the way for a series of fresh crises , economic and otherwise , in the coming decades .
however serious those crises turn out to be , hist@@ ori@@ ans a century from now will likely des@@ pair at our short@@ si@@ gh@@ te@@ dness .
they will note that an@@ al@@ yst@@ s and regulators were narro@@ w@@ ly focused on fixing the financial system by strengthening national over@@ sight regimes .
while this was a worthy goal , hist@@ ori@@ ans will point out , it was far from the only imperative .
to prepare the world to confront the challenges posed by globalization and technological development in a way that supports sustainable and equ@@ itable growth , governance institutions and regulations at both the national and international levels must be dras@@ tically improved .
yet not nearly enough has been invested in this effort .
beyond regional bodies like the europ@@ ean union , international financial governance has remained largely un@@ touched .
worse , because the partial fi@@ xes to the financial system will enable even more globalization , they will end up making matters worse , as stra@@ in on al@@ read@@ y-@@ inadequate governance and regulatory frameworks increases , not only in finance , but also in other economic and technological fields .
mean@@ while , enormous financial investments focused on securing a higher rate of return are likely to fuel technological innovation , further stres@@ sing regulatory systems in finance and beyond .
major technological advances fu@@ eled by cheap money can cause markets to change so fast that policy and institutional change cannot keep up .
and new markets can emerge that offer huge pay@@ off@@ s for early adop@@ ters or investors , who benefit from remaining several steps ahead of national and international regulators .
this is what happened in the run@@ -up to the 2008 crisis .
new techn@@ olog@@ y-@@ enabled financial instruments created opportunities for some to make huge amounts of money .
but regulators were unable to keep up with the innovations , which ended up generating risks that affected the entire economy .
this points to a fundamental difference between global crises of the twenty-@@ first century and , say , the great de@@ pression in the 19@@ 30@@ s or , indeed , any past sto@@ ck-@@ market cr@@ ash@@ es .
because of the financial sector ’ s growth , more actors benefit from under-@@ regulation and weak governance in the short term , making today ’ s crises more difficult to prevent .
complic@@ ating matters further , the systems affected by today ’ s crises extend well beyond any one regulatory body ’ s jurisdiction .
that makes crises far un@@ ru@@ lier , and their consequences – including their long-term influence on societies and politics – more difficult to pre@@ dict .
the next crises – made more likely by rising nation@@ alism and a growing dis@@ regard for science and fac@@ t-@@ based policy@@ making – may be financial , but they could also imp@@ licate real@@ ms as varied as migration , trade , cy@@ ber@@ space , pollution , and climate change .
in all of these areas , national and international governance institutions are weak or incomplete , and there are few independent actors , such as wat@@ ch@@ dog groups , demanding transparency and accountability .
this makes it harder not only to prevent crises – not least because it creates opportunities for actors to game the system and shir@@ k responsibility – but also to respond to them .
the 2008 crisis cast a har@@ sh spot@@ light on just how bad we are at responding quickly to disasters , especially those fu@@ eled by frag@@ mented governance .
to be sure , as the her@@ tie school ’ s 201@@ 8 governance report shows , there have been some improvements in preparing for and managing crises .
but we must become more alert to how developments in a wide range of fields – from finance to digital technologies and climate change – can el@@ ude the governance capacities of national and international institutions .
we should be running crisis scenarios and preparing emergency plans for up@@ heav@@ al in all of these fields , and taking stronger steps to mitig@@ ate risks , including by managing debt levels , which today remain much higher in the advanced economies than they were before the 2008 crisis .
moreover , we should ensure that we provide international institutions with the needed resources and responsibilities .
and by pun@@ ishing those who exacerb@@ ate risks for the sake of their own interests , we would strengthen the legitimacy of global governance and the institutions that are meant to conduct it .
as it stands , inadequate cross-border coordination and enforcement of international agreements is a major impe@@ di@@ ment to crisis prevention and management .
yet , far from addressing this weakness , the world is revi@@ ving an out@@ dated model of national sovereignty that makes crises of various kinds more likely .
unless we change course soon , the world of 2@@ 1@@ 18 will have much reason to regard us with sc@@ orn .
2011 : my space od@@ ys@@ sey
mo@@ sco@@ w – most people who know of me think of me as an inform@@ ation-@@ technology expert , someone who probably lives in c@@ alifor@@ nia and inv@@ ests in ed@@ g@@ y internet start-@@ ups .
in fact , my formal residence is in new y@@ or@@ k city , but i am about to spend most of the next five months in rus@@ sia , training to be a cos@@ mon@@ aut in star city , just outside mo@@ sco@@ w .
i just took it for granted that , by the time i was , say , 40 , space travel would be a common thing .
my father was involved with the united states space program , and we had some moon rocks at home , so i thought it was no big deal .
then i got dis@@ trac@@ ted for about 40 years .
a few years ago , however , i started paying attention to space again .
a lot of people i knew in the it industry were doing the same : el@@ on mus@@ k , a co-@@ founder of pa@@ yp@@ al , founded spac@@ e-@@ x ; je@@ ff be@@ z@@ os of amaz@@ on started a spac@@ ec@@ raft company called blue origin ; je@@ ff gre@@ as@@ on , a senior manager at in@@ tel , started x@@ c@@ or a@@ erospace ( in which i ’ m an investor ) .
in 2005 , the last year i held my p@@ c forum conference for it entrepreneurs , i started a conference called flight school for entrepreneurs in space and private aviation .
mean@@ while , in about 2005 , i was in south afri@@ ca with a small group advis@@ ing former president th@@ ab@@ o m@@ bek@@ i and his government about its it policy .
one of the group was mark sh@@ utt@@ le@@ worth , founder of th@@ aw@@ te ( sold to ver@@ is@@ ign ) , who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second “ space tourist . ”
one evening , the group sat around a cam@@ pf@@ ire as the sun set , and around 50 afri@@ can scho@@ ol@@ children were b@@ uss@@ ed in .
altogether , there were about 100 of us , president m@@ bek@@ i included , around a ro@@ aring fire .
once it was dark , a screen was set up and mark showed home videos from space .
he gave a fascinating talk about his advent@@ ures , complete with cli@@ ps of him flo@@ ating around , cat@@ ching bub@@ bles in his mouth , and so on .
the kids loved it , and i &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ m sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science .
eventually , i invested in space advent@@ ures , the company that organized sh@@ utt@@ le@@ worth ’ s trip into space .
later , i went on a tour that they organized to watch the launch of char@@ les si@@ mon@@ y@@ i , the fifth ( and soon sevent@@ h ) space tourist , from ba@@ i@@ kon@@ ur in k@@ az@@ akh@@ stan .
( si@@ mon@@ y@@ i wrote the micro@@ soft word program , and now has another start-@@ up , inten@@ tional software , and a foundation , as well as a web site , char@@ les@@ in@@ spac@@ e.@@ org@@ . )
soon after , i started cas@@ ually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cos@@ mon@@ aut with the space advent@@ ures team .
yes , i would love to actually go , but the trip to space costs $ 35 to $ 40 million , whereas backup training costs “ only ” $ 3 million .
so i had v@@ ague thoughts that i might go into space some@@ time in 2011 - the year that goo@@ gle co-@@ founder ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in is ( very ) tent@@ atively sl@@ ated to go .
space advent@@ ures was pushing for 2009 , but i was pretty busy .
then something happened last spring : my s@@ ister em@@ ily discovered that she had cancer and had a double ma@@ st@@ ec@@ tom@@ y .
( she is doing well now and , in fact , just won a mini-@@ mar@@ athon . )
a couple of weeks later , i was faced with one of those conflicts : a board meeting here , a conference there , another opportunity at the same time somewhere else . “ a@@ a@@ ag@@ h , ” i thought , “ if only i had a double ma@@ st@@ ec@@ tom@@ y : i could cancel all these things and no one would compla@@ in ! ”
good grie@@ f ! i realized my priorities were all out of wh@@ ack . so in some od@@ d way , this sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal in rus@@ sia is my alternative to a double ma@@ st@@ ec@@ tom@@ y – a positive one , to be sure , but the same kind of res@@ et-@@ button experience .
it is also the answer to another question i hear a lot because of my work on human geneti@@ cs through 23@@ and@@ me ( www.@@ 23@@ and@@ me@@ .com ) and the personal gen@@ ome project ( www.@@ person@@ al@@ gen@@ om@@ e.@@ org ) : if you learned you had a high chance of developing al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s in a few years , what would you do ?
why , i ’ d go train to be a cos@@ mon@@ aut , of course ! and why wait to find out i may get al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s ? next month , i will write about what training to go into space actually involves .
a com@@ eb@@ ack strategy for europ@@ e
stock@@ hol@@ m / ma@@ dri@@ d – when pop@@ e fran@@ c@@ is addressed the europ@@ ean parliament last nov@@ ember , he compared the europ@@ ean union to a grand@@ mother – pleasant and rich with experience , but lacking the vit@@ ality and energy of the past .
it is high time , fran@@ c@@ is argued , that eu leaders shed their do@@ zy image , recognize the strategic challenges that europ@@ e faces , and for@@ ge a clear policy for tackling them .
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , the pop@@ e ’ s character@@ ization was alarm@@ ingly accurate in some respects .
but , despite its seem@@ ing las@@ situ@@ de , europ@@ e re@@ tains significant strengths .
it is a hub of high-level thought and innovation ; it is home to some of the world ’ s most competitive regions and industries ; and , perhaps most impressive , it has built a community and market encomp@@ ass@@ ing a half-@@ billion people .
but the world is changing : the asi@@ a-@@ p@@ aci@@ fic region is increasingly influ@@ encing global developments , economic and otherwise .
the trans@@ -@@ p@@ aci@@ fic partnership – by which the united states and 11 other countries would create a me@@ ga@@ -@@ regional free-@@ trade zone – would most likely accelerate this shift ( all the more so if ch@@ ina eventually jo@@ ins ) .
though the t@@ pp faces no shortage of hur@@ d@@ les to clear before an agreement is fin@@ alized , its potential to au@@ gment a@@ sia ’ s economic power cannot be under@@ estimated .
europ@@ e must work to secure its position in the new world order – beginning by enhancing its own trade and investment ties with the us .
the problem is that , as the t@@ pp negotiations progress , talks on the eu@@ -@@ us transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t@@ tip ) have become so deeply mi@@ red in domestic controversi@@ es that the entire project may well be sc@@ utt@@ led .
business leaders on both sides of the at@@ lan@@ tic are convinced that a successful t@@ tip agreement would bring substantial economic benefits – a perception that many studies reinforce .
yet tri@@ vi@@ al issues – for example , the use of ch@@ lor@@ in@@ ated chi@@ cken and settlements of investor disputes – continue to domin@@ ate the debate .
the t@@ tip ’ s goal is to un@@ le@@ ash the power of the transatlantic economy , which remains by far the world ’ s largest and weal@@ thi@@ est market , accounting for three-@@ quarters of global financial activity and more than half of world trade .
( if the t@@ tip was opened to other economies – such as tur@@ key , m@@ ex@@ ico , and can@@ ada – the benefits would be even greater . )
even more comp@@ elling than the benefits of achieving an agreement , though , are the potentially catastro@@ p@@ hic consequences of failure .
for star@@ ters , a break@@ down of t@@ tip talks would give considerable amm@@ uni@@ tion to those in the united king@@ dom who advocate withdrawal from the eu ; conver@@ sely , if the t@@ tip were implemented , the uk would be un@@ wise – and thus unlikely – to leave .
moreover , the perception that the eu ’ s internal squ@@ ab@@ bles had led it to squ@@ ander a strategic opportunity would probably drive the us to accelerate its dis@@ engagement from the continent .
and rus@@ sian president v@@ ladimir pu@@ tin would inv@@ ari@@ ably regard the eu ’ s failure as a major opportunity to ex@@ ert more influence over parts of europ@@ e .
all of this contributes to a stark@@ ly fundamental strategic risk : if the t@@ tip st@@ alls or collap@@ ses , while the t@@ pp moves forward and succ@@ ee@@ ds , the global balance will tip strongly in a@@ sia ’ s favor – and europ@@ e will have few options , if any , for reg@@ a@@ ining its economic and geo@@ political influence .
when the t@@ tip was first proposed , europ@@ e seemed to recognize its value .
indeed , it was the eu that pushed the us , which initially doub@@ ted europ@@ e ’ s commitment , to launch the negotiation process in jun@@ e 2013 .
the ambition was to complete the negotiations on “ one tank of gas . ”
no one wanted to end@@ ure pro@@ trac@@ ted talks – or the associated political pain .
but eu leaders essentially abandoned the project , seem@@ ingly confir@@ ming ameri@@ can fears .
trade negoti@@ ators strug@@ gl@@ ed to make head@@ way , while anti-@@ globalization groups sei@@ zed control of the public dis@@ course , presenting the t@@ tip as a threat to everything from europ@@ e ’ s democracy to its health .
this is danger@@ ously in@@ accurate talk , and eu leaders must prevent it from gaining any more tra@@ ction by making the strategic case for the agreement .
and they must revi@@ ve their commitment to conclude the talks successfully in 2015 .
this is not to say that resolving the remaining issues in the t@@ tip negotiations will be simple .
but establishing a trade agreement , especially one that entails so many regulatory issues , is always difficult , as it must account for the complexity and change@@ ability of modern economies .
the fact is that the challenges inherent in completing the t@@ tip are no more in@@ trac@@ table than those that eu leaders have faced in the last few years of crisis .
when the t@@ tip negotiations resume next month , eu leaders must push for genuine progress , with the goal of completing a deal by the end of the year .
the good news is that the recent mid@@ term elections in the us might have improved their chances .
president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama now might get so-called fast-@@ track negotiating authority from congress .
if he does , congress would simply approve or reject any negotiated agreement , rather than pi@@ cking it apart .
the us presidential election season is starting , and other issues in the new year could easily take over the eu agenda .
that is why europ@@ e ’ s leaders have no time to waste .
they must sei@@ ze economic opportunity – and aver@@ t strategic disaster .
another slow year for the global economy
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – last ap@@ ri@@ l , the international monetary fund projected that the world economy would grow by 3.5 % in 2015 .
in the ensu@@ ing months , that forecast was steadily wh@@ it@@ t@@ led down , reaching 3.1 % in oc@@ tober .
but the im@@ f continues to insist – as it has , with almost ban@@ al pre@@ dict@@ ability , for the last seven years – that next year will be better .
but it is almost certainly wrong yet again .
for star@@ ters , world trade is growing at an an@@ em@@ ic annual rate of 2 % , compared to 8 % from 2003 to 2007 .
whereas trade growth during those head@@ y years far exceeded that of world g@@ d@@ p , which aver@@ aged 4.@@ 5 % , lat@@ ely , trade and g@@ d@@ p growth rates have been about the same .
even if g@@ d@@ p growth out@@ stri@@ ps growth in trade this year , it will likely amount to no more than 2.@@ 7 % .
the question is why .
according to christ@@ ina and da@@ vi@@ d ro@@ mer of the university of c@@ alifor@@ nia , ber@@ kel@@ ey , the after@@ sho@@ cks of modern financial crises – that is , since world war ii – fa@@ de after 2-@@ 3 years .
the har@@ v@@ ard economists car@@ men rein@@ hart and kenn@@ eth ro@@ go@@ ff say that it takes five years for a country to dig itself out of a financial crisis .
and , indeed , the financial dis@@ locations of 2007-@@ 2008 have largely rec@@ eded .
so what accounts for the s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish economic recovery ?
one popular explanation lies in the fu@@ zz@@ y notion of “ sec@@ ular stag@@ nation ” : long-term de@@ pressed demand for goods and services is undermining incentives to invest and hire .
but demand would remain weak only if people l@@ acked confidence in the future .
the only logical explanation for this en@@ during lack of confidence , as nor@@ th@@ western university ’ s ro@@ bert g@@ ord@@ on has pain@@ stak@@ ingly documented and argued , is slow productivity growth .
before the crisis – and especially from 2003 to 2007 – slow productivity growth was being ob@@ s@@ cu@@ red by an ill@@ us@@ ory sense of prosperity in much of the world .
in some countries – notably , the united states , sp@@ ain , and i@@ reland – rising real-@@ estate prices , specul@@ ative construction , and financial ris@@ k-@@ taking were mutually reinforcing .
at the same time , countries were amp@@ li@@ fying one another ’ s growth through trade .
central to the global boom was ch@@ ina , the rising giant that floo@@ ded the world with cheap exports , putting a li@@ d on global inflation .
equally important , ch@@ ina imported a huge volume of commodities , thereby bol@@ stering many afri@@ can and l@@ atin ameri@@ can economies , and purchased german cars and machines , enabling europ@@ e ’ s largest economy to keep its regional supply chains hum@@ ming .
this dynamic revers@@ ed around mar@@ ch 2008 , when the us res@@ cu@@ ed its fif@@ th-@@ largest investment bank , bear st@@ ern@@ s , from collapse .
with the eurozone banks also deeply imp@@ lic@@ ated in the sub@@ prime mort@@ gage m@@ ess and desper@@ ately short of us dollars , ameri@@ ca and much of europ@@ e began a re@@ mor@@ sel@@ ess slide into recession .
whereas in the boom years , world trade had spread the bo@@ un@@ ty , it was now spreading the mal@@ a@@ ise .
as each country ’ s g@@ d@@ p growth s@@ lowed , so did its imports , causing its trading partners ’ growth to slow as well .
the us economy began to emerge from its recession in the second half of 2009 , thanks largely to aggressive monetary policy and steps to stabili@@ ze the financial system .
eurozone policymakers , by contrast , rejected monetary stimulus and implemented fiscal austerity measures , while ign@@ oring the deepening dist@@ ress of their banks .
the eurozone thus pushed the world into a second global recession .
just when that recession seemed to have run its course , emerging economies began to un@@ ra@@ vel .
in oc@@ tober 2012 , the im@@ f celebrated emerging economies ’ “ re@@ sili@@ ence . ”
as if on cue , that fac@@ ade began to cru@@ m@@ ble , reve@@ aling an in@@ convenient truth : factors like high commodity prices and massive capital in@@ flows had been conce@@ aling serious economic weaknesses , while legitim@@ izing a culture of gar@@ ish inequality and ra@@ mp@@ ant corruption .
these problems are now being compo@@ unded by the growth slow@@ down in ch@@ ina , the ful@@ cru@@ m of global trade .
and the worst is yet to come .
ch@@ ina ’ s huge industrial over@@ capacity and property glu@@ t needs to be wo@@ und down ; the hu@@ br@@ is driving its global acqu@@ isi@@ tions must be re@@ ined in ; and its corruption networks have to be disman@@ t@@ led .
in short , the factors that dra@@ gged down the global economy in 2015 will pers@@ ist – and in some cases even intensify – in the new year .
the eurozone , having enjoyed a temporary re@@ pri@@ eve from austerity , will be constra@@ ined by list@@ less global trade .
rising interest rates on corporate bonds por@@ tend s@@ lower growth in the us .
ch@@ ina ’ s collap@@ sing asset values could trigger financial tur@@ bul@@ ence .
and policymakers are ad@@ ri@@ ft , with little political leverage to stem these trends .
the im@@ f should stop forec@@ asting renewed growth and issue a warning that the global economy will remain weak and vulnerable unless world leaders act energe@@ tically to sp@@ ur innovation and growth .
such an effort is long over@@ due .
tru@@ mp@@ ian uncertainty
new y@@ or@@ k – every jan@@ u@@ ary , i try to craft a forecast for the coming year .
economic forec@@ asting is not@@ ori@@ ously difficult ; but , not@@ with@@ standing the truth expressed in har@@ ry tru@@ man ’ s request for a one-@@ armed econom@@ ist ( who w@@ ouldn ’ t be able to say “ on the other hand ” ) , my record has been credible .
in recent years , i correctly fo@@ res@@ aw that , in the absence of stronger fiscal stimulus ( which was not forthcoming in either europ@@ e or the united states ) , recovery from the great recession of 2008 would be slow .
in making these forecasts , i have re@@ lied more on analysis of underlying economic forces than on complex econom@@ et@@ ric models .
for example , at the beginning of 2016 , it seemed clear that the deficiencies of global aggreg@@ ate demand that have been mani@@ fest for the last several years were unlikely to change dramatically .
thus , i thought that forec@@ ast@@ ers of a stronger recovery were looking at the world through ro@@ se-@@ tin@@ ted gl@@ asses .
not so the political events of 2016 .
i had been writing for years that unless growing inequality – especially in the us , but also in many countries throughout the world – was addressed , there would be political consequences .
but inequality continued to wor@@ sen – with striking data showing that average life expec@@ tan@@ cy in the us was on the decline .
these results were fo@@ res@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by a study last year , by anne case and an@@ gu@@ s de@@ aton , which showed that life expec@@ tan@@ cy was on the decline for large segments of the population – including ameri@@ ca ’ s so-called an@@ gr@@ y men of the r@@ ust belt .
but , with the incomes of the bottom 90 % having stag@@ n@@ ated for close to a third of a century ( and declining for a significant proportion ) , the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large s@@ wa@@ ths of the country .
and while ameri@@ ca might be at the extreme of this trend , things were little better elsewhere .
but , if it seemed clear that there would be political consequences , their form and timing were far less obvious .
why did the bac@@ kl@@ ash in the us come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend , rather than earlier ?
and why did it mani@@ fest itself in a l@@ urch to the right ?
after all , it was the re@@ public@@ ans who had blocked assistance to those losing their jobs as a result of the globalization they pushed assi@@ du@@ ously .
it was the re@@ public@@ ans who , in 26 states , refused to allow the expansion of medic@@ aid , thereby den@@ ying health insurance to those at the bottom .
and why was the vic@@ tor som@@ ebo@@ dy who made his living from taking advantage of others , openly admitted not paying his fair share of taxes , and made tax avoid@@ ance a point of pride ?
don@@ ald tru@@ mp gras@@ ped the spirit of the time : things weren ’ t going well , and many voters wanted change .
now they will get it : there will be no business as usual .
but sel@@ dom has there been more uncertainty .
which policies tru@@ mp will pursue remains unknown , to say nothing of which will succeed or what the consequences will be .
tru@@ mp seems h@@ ell@@ -@@ b@@ ent on having a trade war .
but how will ch@@ ina and m@@ ex@@ ico respond ?
tru@@ mp may well understand that what he proposes will viol@@ ate world trade organization rules , but he may also know that it will take a long time for the w@@ to to rule against him .
and by then , ameri@@ ca ’ s trade account may have been re@@ balanced .
but two can play that game : ch@@ ina can take similar actions , though its response is likely to be more sub@@ tle .
tru@@ mp may have reason to think he could win ; after all , ch@@ ina is more dependent on exports to the us than the us is on exports to ch@@ ina , which gives the us an advantage .
but a trade war is not a zer@@ o-@@ sum game .
the us stands to lose as well .
ch@@ ina may be more effective in targeting its re@@ tali@@ ation to cause acute political pain .
and the chin@@ ese may be in a better position to respond to us attempts to inf@@ lic@@ t pain on them than the us is to respond to the pain that ch@@ ina might inf@@ lic@@ t on ameri@@ cans .
it ’ s any@@ body ’ s gu@@ ess who can stand the pain better .
will it be the us , where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long , or ch@@ ina , which , despite troub@@ led times , has managed to generate growth in excess of 6 % ?
more broadly , the re@@ publi@@ can / tru@@ mp agenda , with its tax cuts even more wei@@ ghted toward the rich than the standard go@@ p recip@@ e would imply , is based on the idea of tri@@ ck@@ le-@@ down prosperity – a continuation of the re@@ ag@@ an era ’ s sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ side economics , which never actually worked .
fi@@ re-@@ brea@@ thing rhetoric , or ra@@ ving three a.m. t@@ we@@ ets , may assu@@ age the anger of those left behind by the re@@ ag@@ an revolution , at least for a while .
but for how long ?
and what happens then ?
tru@@ mp might like to repe@@ al the ordinary laws of economics , as he goes about his version of v@@ oo@@ do@@ o economics .
but he can ’ t .
still , as the world ’ s largest economy leads the way into un@@ char@@ ted political waters in 2017 and beyond , it would be fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy for a mere mor@@ tal to attempt a forecast , other than to state the obvious : the waters will almost certainly be ch@@ opp@@ y , and many – if not most – pun@@ dit ships will sin@@ k along the way .
9 / 11 and the new author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism
five years after the attacks on the twin to@@ wers in new y@@ or@@ k and the p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on in wash@@ ington , “ 9 / 11 ” is no longer a mere date .
it has entered the history books as the beginning of something new , a new era perhaps , but in any case a time of change .
the terrorist bom@@ b@@ ings in ma@@ dri@@ d and lon@@ don and elsewhere will also be remember@@ ed ; but it is “ 9 / 11 ” that has become the cat@@ ch@@ phrase , almost like “ aug@@ ust 19@@ 14 . ”
but was it really a war that started on se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 11 , 2001 ?
not all are happy about this ameri@@ can notion .
during the he@@ y@@ day of ir@@ ish terrorism in the uk , successive bri@@ tish governments went out of their way not to conc@@ ede to the ira the notion that a war was being w@@ aged . “ war ” would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies , in a sense as equ@@ als in a bloo@@ dy contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement .
this is neither a correct description nor a useful termin@@ ology for terrorist acts , which are more correctly described as criminal .
by calling them war – and nam@@ ing an oppon@@ ent , usually al-@@ q@@ a@@ eda and its leader , o@@ sam@@ a bin laden – the united states government has justified domestic changes that , before the 9 / 11 attacks , would have been unacceptable in any free country .
most of these changes were embo@@ died in the so-called “ usa patri@@ ot act . ”
though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations , the patri@@ ot act ’ s overall effect was to ero@@ de the great pillars of liberty , such as ha@@ be@@ as cor@@ p@@ us , the right to recourse to an independent court whenever the state depri@@ ves an individual of his freedom .
from an early date , the prison camp at gu@@ ant@@ ánam@@ o bay in cu@@ ba became the symbol of something un@@ heard of : the arrest without trial of “ illegal comb@@ at@@ ants ” who are deprived of all human rights .
the world now wonder@@ s how many more of these non-@@ human humans are there in how many places .
for everyone else , a kind of state of emergency was proc@@ laimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights .
controls at borders have become an or@@ deal for many , and police persecution now burdens quite a few .
a climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspici@@ ous or acts suspici@@ ously , notably for mus@@ li@@ ms .
such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted .
on the contrary , by and large it was the critics , not the supporters , of these measures who found themselves in trouble .
in b@@ rit@@ ain , where prime minister ton@@ y bla@@ ir supported the us attitude entirely , the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory .
bla@@ ir was the first to argue that security is the first freedom .
in other words , liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives , but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define .
this is the beginning of a new author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism .
the problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism , though in many it has not become quite as specific .
in most countries of continental europ@@ e , “ 9 / 11 ” has remained an ameri@@ can date .
there is even a debate – and indeed some evidence – concerning the question of whether involvement in the “ war against terrorism ” has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts .
this stance , however , has not prevented the spread of something for which a german word is used in other languages , too : ang@@ st .
a diff@@ use anxi@@ ety is gaining ground .
people feel un@@ easy and worried , especially when travel@@ ing .
any train accident or air@@ plane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism .
thus , 9 / 11 has meant , directly or indirectly , a great shock , both psych@@ ologically and to our political systems .
while terrorism is fought in the name of democracy , the fight has in fact led to a distinct weak@@ ening of democracy , owing to official legislation and popular ang@@ st .
one of the worrying features of the 9 / 11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpet@@ r@@ ators ’ res@@ ent@@ ment of the west and its ways .
but the west ’ s key features , democracy and the rule of law , have taken a far more severe batter@@ ing at the hands of their defen@@ ders than by their att@@ ack@@ ers .
two steps , above all , are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9 / 11 .
first , we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary .
some of today ’ s restrictions on ha@@ be@@ as cor@@ p@@ us and civil liber@@ ties have sun@@ set clauses restric@@ ting their validity ; all such rules should be re-@@ examined by parliaments regularly .
second , and more importantly , our leaders must seek to calm , rather than exploit , public anxi@@ ety .
the terrorists with whom we are currently at “ war ” cannot win , because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy .
that is all the more reason for democ@@ rats to stand t@@ all in defending our values – first and foremost by acting in accordance with them .
transatlantic trade for all
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – the negotiations to create a transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the europ@@ ean union and the united states are being widely welcomed .
bri@@ tish prime minister da@@ vi@@ d cam@@ eron has called the t@@ tip a “ on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ generation prize , ” c@@ iting potential gains of £ 80 billion ( $ 12@@ 5.@@ 5 billion ) each for the eu and the us and £ 85 billion for the rest of the world .
for a world we@@ ary of waiting for the world trade organization ’ s inter@@ min@@ able do@@ ha trade round to conclude , even a bilateral trade initiative may seem like a bo@@ on , especially when , as a recent financial times edi@@ torial pointed out , “ bilateral ” covers half of the world ’ s economy .
but there is a serious down@@ side : the deal could h@@ urt develop@@ ing-@@ country expor@@ ters , unless the eu and the us make a concer@@ ted effort to protect these actors ’ interests .
the feature of the proposed pact that e@@ lic@@ its the most exc@@ itement – its focus on regulatory barriers like mandatory product standards – should actually inc@@ ite the greatest concern .
given low tariffs in the eu and the us – less than 5 % , on average – further preferential reductions will not seriously han@@ di@@ cap out@@ si@@ ders .
but , when it comes to standards – such as those governing safety , health , and the environment – the market-@@ access requirements are brutal and bin@@ ary : either you meet the established standard or you do not sell .
as a result , third-country firms ’ options will depend on how t@@ tip standards are established : through harmon@@ ization ( adoption of a common standard ) or mutual recognition ( acceptance of goods that meet one another ’ s established standards ) .
the first option would enable producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale .
but , in some cases , the harmon@@ ized standard could be more stringent than some countries ’ original standards .
even though new standards would apply to suppliers from all exporting countries , compliance costs usually vary , meaning that those less equipped to meet higher standards could suffer .
in the late 1990 ’ s , when the eu decided to harmon@@ ize standards for af@@ lat@@ ox@@ ins ( a group of toxic compo@@ unds produced by certain mol@@ ds ) , eight member states – including ital@@ y , the ne@@ ther@@ lands , and sp@@ ain – raised their national standards substantially , which is likely to have caused afri@@ can exports of cereals , dri@@ ed fruits , and nu@@ ts to europ@@ e to decline by as much as $ 6@@ 70 million .
with mutual recognition , the eu and the us would accept each other ’ s standards or con@@ form@@ ity-@@ assessment procedures , allowing firms to adhere to the less stringent requirements in each area .
if the policy were extended to third-country firms , it would have a powerful liber@@ alizing impact .
for example , mal@@ ay@@ sian television producers could choose to comply with , say , ameri@@ ca ’ s easi@@ er-@@ to-@@ meet safety standards , then sell the same product in both markets , re@@ ap@@ ing the benefits of economies of scale while lower@@ ing compliance costs .
if , however , the t@@ tip excluded third-country firms from the mutual recognition policy , their competitiveness vis-à-vis europ@@ ean and ameri@@ can companies would dimin@@ ish substantially .
indeed , our research shows that when mut@@ u@@ al-@@ recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin , in@@ tra-@@ regional trade increases – at the expense of trade with other countries – and that developing countries tend to suffer most .
in fact , exc@@ essively constra@@ ining rules of origin have proved problematic for some of the eu ’ s previous recognition agreements , such as those governing profession@@ al-@@ services standards .
while a bra@@ zi@@ lian orange admitted for sale in portu@@ gal can be sold throughout the eu , a bra@@ zi@@ lian engine@@ er or accoun@@ tant licensed in portu@@ gal must ful@@ fill separate licensing requirements to work elsewhere in the eu , ham@@ per@@ ing mu@@ ch-@@ needed labor mobility by forcing non-@@ europ@@ ean workers to end@@ ure costly and in@@ efficient bureaucratic procedures .
furthermore , when it comes to tariffs and standards , w@@ to rules are not created equal .
while they protect countries excluded from bilateral or regional tariff agreements , thereby ensuring that integrated markets do not receive additional advantages , few safeguards exist to sh@@ ield third countries from the fall@@ out of agreements on mandatory standards .
even in the absence of international rules , the eu and the us could take two actions to ensure that the t@@ tip does not have adverse consequences for developing economies .
first , they could allow all countries to re@@ ap the benefits of a bilateral mut@@ u@@ al-@@ recognition deal by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin .
second , where they do consider harmon@@ ization , they could favor the less stringent of the original standards , unless there is credible evidence that it would not support the relevant regulatory objective .
this is ak@@ in to a w@@ to test for depar@@ tures from established international standards .
if the eu and the us made these two commitments , the rest of the world could follow the t@@ tip negotiations with hope , rather than tre@@ pi@@ dation .
a bad deal for ameri@@ ca ’ s future
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – the pain@@ fully negotiated us budget legislation that president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama signed on aug@@ ust 2 combines an increase in ameri@@ ca ’ s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending , thus aver@@ ting the prospect of the first default in the 2@@ 24-@@ year history of the united states .
but the agreement has three major f@@ laws .
two of them offset each other , but the third threat@@ ens what ameri@@ ca needs most in the coming years : economic growth .
the first f@@ law is that the spending reductions are badly tim@@ ed : coming as they do when the us economy is weak , they risk trig@@ gering another recession .
the measure ’ s second short@@ coming , however , is that the spending reductions that it mand@@ ates are modest .
while the legislation does too little to address ameri@@ ca ’ s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits , the damage that it inf@@ lic@@ ts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited .
the third and most damaging f@@ law , however , is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places .
because the democ@@ rats in congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving , int@@ act , ameri@@ ca ’ s principal welfare programs for senior citizens , social security and medi@@ care , the legislation does not touch either of them .
these programs ’ costs will rise sharp@@ ly as the 7@@ 8-@@ milli@@ on-@@ strong bab@@ y-@@ boom generation – those born between 19@@ 46 and 1964 – reti@@ res and collec@@ ts benefits , accounting for the largest increase in government spending and pro@@ spective deficits in the years ahead .
and , because the re@@ public@@ ans in congress have an equally strong all@@ ergy to raising any taxes , any time , under any circumstances , the bill does not rely at all on tax increases – not even for the weal@@ thi@@ est ameri@@ cans – for the deficit reduction that it provides .
all of the spending cuts come from the “ discre@@ tionary ” part of the federal budget , which exclu@@ des social security , medi@@ care , the medic@@ aid program for the poor , and interest on the national debt .
that leaves only about one-@@ third of total federal spending from which to cut , and much of that goes to the defense budget , which re@@ public@@ ans will attempt to protect in the future .
so the structure established by the aug@@ ust 2 law concentr@@ ates deficit reduction on the “ discre@@ tionary non-@@ defense ” part of the federal budget , which is only about 10 % of it .
this is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the us will need in the years ahead .
worse yet , discre@@ tionary non-@@ defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth – and economic growth is indispensable for ameri@@ ca ’ s future prosperity and global standing .
growth is , in the first place , the best way to reduce the country ’ s budget deficits .
the higher the growth rate , the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates ; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits .
moreover , economic growth is necessary to keep the promise – enor@@ m@@ ously important to individual ameri@@ cans – that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the prec@@ eding one , the popular term for which is “ the ameri@@ can dream . ”
just as important for non-@@ ameri@@ cans , only robust economic growth can ensure that the us su@@ sta@@ ins its expan@@ sive role in the world , which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in europ@@ e , east a@@ sia , and the middle east .
as th@@ om@@ as l. fried@@ man and i explain in our forthcoming book that used to be us : how ameri@@ ca fell behind in the world it inv@@ ented and how we can come back , a crucial factor in ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economic success has been an ongoing public-@@ private partnership , which dates back to the founding of the country , that is imper@@ iled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the aug@@ ust 2 legislation .
the first three elements of the ameri@@ can formula for growth cost money , and that money is included in the “ discre@@ tionary non-@@ defense ” part of the federal budget now targeted by the deb@@ t-@@ ceiling legislation .
cutting these programs will lower ameri@@ can economic growth in the long term , with negative consequences both at home and abroad .
reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education , infrastructure , and research and development is ak@@ in to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fin@@ gers .
most of the weight will remain , and one ’ s life prospects will have wor@@ sen@@ ed significantly .
reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do , but the aug@@ ust 2 law does it in the wrong way .
unless more deficit reduction , which is inevitable , comes from cur@@ bing entit@@ lement benefits and increasing revenues , and less from programs vital for economic growth , the result will be a poorer , weaker us – and a more uncertain , if not unstable , world .
eu commission president roman@@ o pro@@ di has proposed a scheme to strengthen the union &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s executive .
b@@ rit@@ ain , fran@@ ce , and sp@@ ain are working on an oppos@@ ing plan that will consolidate eu executive powers among the biggest eu states .
what &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s the ordinary europ@@ ean to think ?
so complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcast@@ ers have abandoned reporting about the convention .
eu citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the convention should achieve by asking this question : how should governmental functions be divided between the eu and its member nations ?
to answer this , we need to gras@@ p government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s true purpose .
government should provide citizens with public goods : collective defense , legislation and regulation , enforcement of the rule of law .
these can be provided at different levels : local , regional , national , or supran@@ ational government , i.e. , the eu .
but what is the right level ?
in some areas , decentr@@ alization works because it recogni@@ zes diverse local or national communities .
europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s allocation of governmental powers should be based on the principle that institutions carry out only those activities with clear economies of scale and where differences of opinion are modest .
the lower a government activity &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s extern@@ alities , the more it should be loc@@ alized .
low extern@@ alities imply limited benefits to be gained from centr@@ alization ; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmon@@ ization would be too high .
the euro , for example , delivers clear advantages of scale by favor@@ ing international commerce and avoiding negative extern@@ alities .
in educational policy , however , to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale .
cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance . it would be absurd to deleg@@ ate education and culture to a supran@@ ational level .
of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or extern@@ alities , two stand out : the common market and competition ; and foreign policy and defense .
the former covers anti@@ trust , trade , and the common currency .
some think that fiscal policies - from the structure of taxation to welfare , to budget balances - should also be harmon@@ ized .
but national preferences are diverse , and if mechan@@ ically imposed , fiscal centr@@ alization might inc@@ ite resistance .
nor do centr@@ alized fiscal policies have any real ra@@ ison d &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ ê@@ tre from a constitutional point of view .
the us constitution , for example , does not prescri@@ be balanced budgets for the states .
only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmon@@ ization justified : pro@@ hibitions , say , on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition , impe@@ ding commerce , or restric@@ ting the movement of capital .
there are clear extern@@ alities and economies of scale .
it would be absurd if new y@@ or@@ k pursued a different foreign policy than tex@@ as .
much the same is true in europ@@ e .
the addition of new eu members implies that more internal differences will occur , which means that fewer centr@@ alized policies are justified .
these considerations suggest a series of principles for the convention to consider :
1 . the eu constitution should establish un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally which pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives belong to europ@@ e and which to member countries .
when in doubt , the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain su@@ preme ;
2 . europ@@ e@@ an-@@ level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets , including competition , commercial , and monetary policies ;
3 . fiscal policy should remain largely decentr@@ alized , save for a few exceptions ;
4 . foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence , to be deleg@@ ated to europ@@ e at a proper time ;
5 . the creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies .
so &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; no centr@@ alization without representation . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s eu diver@@ ges enor@@ m@@ ously from these principles ( see table ) , as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture , which represents 2 % of europ@@ ean g@@ d@@ p , accounts for 40 % of eu expendi@@ tures .

europ@@ e faces an historic opportunity .
ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s founding fa@@ thers wrote a constitution that has la@@ sted over 200 years .
members of the europ@@ ean convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse soci@@ et@@ y-@@ and thus a more da@@ un@@ ting constitutional challenge .
but they can succeed by dis@@ playing comparable wisdom and fore@@ sight .
a balanced look at sin@@ o-@@ ameri@@ can imbalances
bei@@ jing – before ju@@ ly 2007 , most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth .
it was argued that the united states ’ rising net foreign deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ g@@ d@@ p ratio – the result of chronic curr@@ ent-@@ account deficits – would put a sharp bra@@ ke on capital in@@ flows , in turn weak@@ ening the dollar , driving up interest rates , and pl@@ ung@@ ing the us economy into crisis .
but this scenario failed to materi@@ alize .
instead , the crisis stem@@ med from the us sub-@@ prime deb@@ ac@@ le , which quickly dra@@ gged the global economy into its deep@@ est recession since the 1930 ’ s .
most economists failed to fore@@ see the economic dynam@@ ics that actually led to the crisis , because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in us total debt .
instead , they focused exclusively on us foreign debt , ign@@ oring household debt ( mort@@ gage and consumer debt ) , public debt , business debt , and financial debt .
in particular , they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of us mort@@ gage and consumer debt .
in 2007 , the mort@@ gage and consumer deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ g@@ d@@ p ratio was more than 90 % , compared to 24 % for net foreign debt .
of course , the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability .
but all parts of a country ’ s total debt and how it is financed are inter@@ connected .
this means two things .
first , funds from different sources of finance are inter@@ change@@ able to a certain degree : defici@@ ency of funds for one component of total debt can be supple@@ mented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components .
second , troub@@ les in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components .
after the sub@@ prime crisis erup@@ ted , mort@@ gage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default .
the fall in us total debt , and the narro@@ wing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds , led to a significant improvement in the us curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit in 2008-@@ 2009 , dis@@ proving us federal reserve board chairman ben ber@@ n@@ an@@ ke ’ s claim that the deficit was caused by a global “ saving glu@@ t . ”
indeed , ameri@@ ca ’ s curr@@ ent-@@ account position strengthened despite the dollar ’ s appreciation in the face of saf@@ e-@@ haven demand .
unfortunately , as a result of the priv@@ ate-@@ sector dele@@ ver@@ aging and an increase in household savings , the us economy , driven by debt and consumption , sli@@ d into recession .
to offset the negative impact of priv@@ ate-@@ sector dele@@ ver@@ aging on growth , the us government has maintained expan@@ sion@@ ary fiscal and monetary policies .
now , with household debt sustained on a kni@@ fe-@@ edge after fe@@ ver@@ ish government intervention , the fiscal position has deterior@@ ated dramatically and the curr@@ ent-@@ account balance has wor@@ sen@@ ed again .
sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability , and the focus of debate about the us current account has shi@@ fted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment .
the most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening us competitiveness .
but where will increased competitiveness come from ?
de@@ valuation of the dollar could improve us competitiveness in the short run , but it is not a solution .
because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on us government securities , de@@ valuation would make foreigners more hes@@ it@@ ant to finance ameri@@ ca ’ s budget deficit .
if foreign financing is not forthcoming , yiel@@ ds on us government debt will rise and the us economy will fall back into recession .
in the long run , ameri@@ ca ’ s growth pattern must under@@ go a structural shift from reli@@ ance on debt and consumption one based on ameri@@ cans va@@ un@@ ted capacity for creativity and innovation .
only then will ameri@@ ca improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respec@@ table growth rate .
but neither improved competitiveness , nor reduction of total debt , can be achieved overnight .
in the short run , the us curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit will remain , regardless of which country runs bilateral sur@@ pl@@ uses .
thus , ch@@ ina ’ s continued re@@ investment of its curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus in us government securities is of utmost important for us growth and financial stability .
given that ameri@@ ca benefits m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly from ch@@ ina ’ s purchases of us government securities , it is difficult to understand why the us government and congress have been compla@@ ining so much about the bilateral curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit .
it is also difficult to gras@@ p why ch@@ ina is so reluc@@ tant to reduce its bilateral surplus , given me@@ ager returns on its massive holdings of us government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future .
the good news is that , following president h@@ u j@@ inta@@ o ’ s recent visit to wash@@ ington , both ameri@@ ca and ch@@ ina have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral curr@@ ent-@@ account balance .
that aug@@ urs well for a more rational and constructive sin@@ o-@@ ameri@@ can dialogue on global imbalances , which would certainly benefit the global economy .
aband@@ oning a@@ sia ’ s poor
new y@@ or@@ k -- more than half of a@@ sia ’ s population -- 1.@@ 8 billion people -- live on less than $ 2 a day ; more than 600 million of them try to survive on less than $ 1 a day .
with food prices now so@@ aring , most of a@@ sia ’ s “ working poor , ” who are already strug@@ gling on degra@@ ded lands , in swe@@ at@@ shops , on streets and at homes , risk further des@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion .
yet the asi@@ an development bank – an institution whose mission is to reduce poverty – last month approved a new corporate strategy ( ad@@ b long term strategic framework 2008-@@ 2020 ) that is omin@@ ously silent on the importance of employment and social protection for the poor .
a hand@@ ful of influ@@ ential ad@@ b bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats with large salaries , secured pensions , comprehensive health insurance , subsidi@@ zed housing , and education for their children , have apparently decided that financing subsidi@@ zed housing , health , nutrition , and child protection programs is not a priority .
nor do they consider land reform , employment services , or pensions for all asi@@ ans a priority .
instead , these officials have decided to re@@ focus ad@@ b operations on three areas : inclusive economic growth , environmentally sustainable growth , and regional integration , with a heavy emphasis on priv@@ ate-@@ sector development .
the ad@@ b is aband@@ oning crucial public support for social development .
the new strategy is a re@@ versal of the policies of the late 1990 ’ s , when the ad@@ b changed its objective from “ economic growth ” to “ poverty reduction . ”
the ad@@ b ’ s earlier policies were based on broad@@ -based growth , good governance , and social development .
ten years later , only an empty corporate motto of “ an a@@ sia and p@@ aci@@ fic region free of poverty ” is left .
social protection , housing , employment , and labor are not on the ad@@ b ’ s new agenda .
health and agriculture will be considered only on a highly selective basis .
only education remains as a future investment sector , given its impact on productivity , but the rest of the mu@@ ch-@@ needed social sector interventions have been abandoned in favor of investment in infrastructure , the environment , regional integration , and finance .
no lesson was learned from the asi@@ an financial crisis , which under@@ sco@@ red the importance of social protection .
pensions are mentioned only under finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector development : the ad@@ b is to promote priv@@ ate-@@ led insurance , despite evidence from the united nations , international labor organization , world bank and n@@ gos showing that private pensions do not reach the poor .
if the ad@@ b were serious about poverty reduction , it would put a significant share of its investments in social development , particularly on non-@@ contribut@@ ory universal social security schemes that can reduce poverty by 35 % to 50 % .
why is the ad@@ b con@@ stric@@ ting its agenda ?
why does it want to deny governments ’ access to mu@@ ch-@@ needed funds for social development ?
the ad@@ b argu@@ es that other agencies are responsible for social development .
but that argument is un@@ justified : while institutions such as the un and n@@ gos may work on social development , they are under-@@ funded compared to the ad@@ b .
besides , plenty of other public and private institutions undertake the infrastructure and finance projects that the ad@@ b now wants to focus on .
so , what is the ad@@ b ’ s added value , and whom does it serve ?
certainly the ad@@ b ’ s new strategy will not serve the majority of asi@@ ans , 60 % of whom still live in poor rural areas .
indeed , a@@ sia and the p@@ aci@@ fic account for three-@@ quarters of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s stun@@ ted , under@@ weight , and mal@@ no@@ ur@@ ished children .
mat@@ ern@@ al mortality rates remain dis@@ mal in several countries .
as food prices rise , so is hunger and poverty .
external and internal pressure at the ad@@ b ’ s annual meeting this may forced the bank to respond to the current food crisis through temporary saf@@ et@@ y-@@ net food security programs .
it also offered medium-term measures such as infrastructure and rural finance .
all of these are good , but they are insufficient .
other measures are needed to reduce poverty in rural areas , such as land reform and rights , agricultural extension services , expanding access to health and non-@@ contribut@@ ory social pensions , just to mention some .
ad@@ b ’ s major goal , however , seems to be to scale up priv@@ ate-@@ sector support from 15 % to 50 % of total bank operations .
several countries have expressed reservations about this .
it will include direct financing , credit enh@@ anc@@ ements , and guarantees – a subsidy to a sector known for its ris@@ ky non-@@ performing operations at the ad@@ b – as well as busin@@ ess-@@ friendly regulations and removal of market “ barriers , ” which include social and labor rights .
such rights can be toler@@ ated only as minimum social safeguards , which the ad@@ b is trying to ne@@ uter through another ongoing review .
unless the ad@@ b ’ s member governments reverse its current policies , they , too , will be bl@@ amed for ign@@ oring the urgent needs of the poor .
poverty reduction requires both economic and social policies that reach people .
growth on its own is not sufficient to guarantee poverty reduction in a@@ sia and the p@@ aci@@ fic .
a banking union baby step
br@@ ussel@@ s – at the beginning of the financial crisis , it was said that banks were , in char@@ les goo@@ d@@ hart ’ s cris@@ p phrase , “ international in life , but national in death . ”
at the time ( 2008-@@ 2009 ) , large international banks had to be res@@ cu@@ ed by their home countries ’ governments when they ran into trouble .
but the problem now in europ@@ e is the opposite : banks are “ national in life , but europ@@ ean in death . ”
in sp@@ ain , for example , local savings banks ( ca@@ j@@ as ) financed an out@@ size real-@@ estate boom .
as the boom turned to b@@ ust , the losses threatened to overwhel@@ m the capacity of the span@@ ish state , and the problem became europ@@ ean , because it threatened the very survival of the euro .
the span@@ ish case is symp@@ tom@@ atic of a larger problem .
national super@@ vis@@ ors always tend to minim@@ ize problems at home .
their inst@@ inc@@ t ( and their bureaucratic interest ) is to defend their countries ’ “ national champi@@ on ” bank ( s ) abroad .
but their resistance to recogni@@ zing problems at home runs even deeper .
until recently , the span@@ ish authorities maintained that the problems in their country ’ s real-@@ estate sector were temporary .
to acknowledge the truth would have meant ad@@ mitting that for years they had over@@ looked the buil@@ d-@@ up of an un@@ sustainable construction boom that now threat@@ ens to bank@@ rupt the entire country .
in the case of i@@ reland , the situation was initially not much different .
when problems started to surface , the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out “ the che@@ ap@@ est bank rescue ever . ”
given national super@@ vis@@ ors ’ predictable tendency not to recognize problems at home , it seemed natural that the cost of cleaning up in@@ sol@@ vent banks should also be borne at the national level .
it thus seemed to make sense that even in the eurozone , banking supervision remained largely national .
the recently created europ@@ ean banking authority has only limited powers over national super@@ vis@@ ors , whose daily work is guided mainly by national considerations .
but reality has shown that this approach is not ten@@ able .
problems might origin@@ ate at the national level , but , owing to monetary union , they quickly threaten the stability of the entire eurozone banking system .
at their jun@@ e summit , europ@@ e ’ s leaders finally recognized the need to recti@@ fy this situation , transfer@@ ring responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the europ@@ ean central bank .
given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union , putting the ec@@ b in charge was an obvious choice .
moreover , the ec@@ b already bears de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone ’ s banking system .
but , until now , it had to lend massive amounts to banks without being able to judge their sound@@ ness , because all of that information was in the hands of national authorities who guar@@ ded it je@@ al@@ ously and typically denied problems until it was too late .
putting the ec@@ b in charge should also help to stop the cre@@ eping dis@@ integration process , which is not publicly visible , but is very real nonetheless .
consider the case of a bank head@@ quar@@ tered in ital@@ y , but with an important subsidiary in ger@@ many .
the german operations naturally generate a surplus of funds ( given that savings in ger@@ many far exceed investment on average ) .
the parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group ’ s liquidity .
but the german supervisory authorities consider ital@@ y at risk and thus oppose any transfer of funds there .
the super@@ vis@@ or of the home country ( ital@@ y ) has the opposite interest .
it would like to see the “ internal capital market ” operate as much as possible .
here , too , it makes sense to have the ec@@ b in charge as a neutral arbit@@ er with respect to these oppos@@ ing interests .
but , while putting the ec@@ b in charge of banking supervision sol@@ ves one problem , it creates another : can national authorities still be held responsible for saving banks that they no longer super@@ vise ?
economic ( and political ) logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund .
officially , this has not yet been acknowledged .
but that is often the way that europ@@ ean integration proce@@ eds : an incomplete step in one area later requires further steps in related areas .
this incre@@ mental approach has worked well in the past ; indeed , today ’ s europ@@ ean union resulted from it .
but a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time that they once had to explain to voters why one step required another .
they will have to walk much more quickly to save the euro .
ab@@ ba eb@@ an : the voice of isra@@ el
for almost two generations , ab@@ ba eb@@ an was isra@@ el &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s voice - its m@@ essenger to the high and m@@ igh@@ ty among the nations as well as to the je@@ wish people all over the world .
since he first appeared at the side of dr@@ . ch@@ aim wei@@ z@@ mann in the late 19@@ 40 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s during the struggle for je@@ wish stat@@ eh@@ ood and sovereignty , few people could articul@@ ate the zion@@ ist and later the isra@@ eli case with comparable el@@ o@@ qu@@ ence and conviction .
with his chur@@ ch@@ illi@@ an pro@@ se and almost sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are@@ an ca@@ den@@ ces , his mel@@ li@@ flu@@ ous phr@@ ases and son@@ orous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the hor@@ rors of world war ii .
as am@@ bassador to the united states and the un , and later as foreign minister , he represented an isra@@ el with which the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s liberal imagination could identify .
larger and more powerful nations were en@@ vious of so a powerful spokes@@ man , and his speeches became text@@ book models for stat@@ es@@ men and diplom@@ ats in distant lands .
his books - which he found time to write despite the hec@@ tic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous er@@ u@@ dition and cryst@@ all@@ ine clarity .
his schol@@ arly training and rhetor@@ ical gi@@ fts supple@@ mented each other in a rare fashion .
rarely has a small country been represented by a stat@@ es@@ man of such world stat@@ ure : only th@@ om@@ as mas@@ ar@@ y@@ k and jan s@@ mu@@ ts come to mind to compare with him .
he was a true patri@@ ot , in the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned sense of the word : proud of his people , but never eth@@ no-@@ cent@@ ric ; a man of the world , but deeply embedded in je@@ wish cultural heritage ; focused on the p@@ lights and tri@@ bul@@ ations of the je@@ wish people , but never losing the universal horiz@@ on of man@@ kind .
in short , he was a modern je@@ w in the best sense of the word .
it was said of prime minister lev@@ i esh@@ ko@@ l that he spoke seven languages , all of them in y@@ id@@ dish .
of eb@@ an it could be said that he spoke ten languages , and all of them with an ox@@ ford / cam@@ bridge acc@@ ent .
yet what appe@@ aled to the outside world was not always an asset in the rou@@ gh and tum@@ ble of isra@@ eli politics .
perhaps eb@@ an was too urban@@ e , too much of a schol@@ ar and gent@@ le@@ man to be able to make it - in dis@@ ra@@ eli &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s phrase - to the top of the gre@@ asy pole .
together with gol@@ da m@@ eir and mo@@ she day@@ an he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the y@@ om ki@@ pp@@ ur war .
he could hardly have been held responsible for the hu@@ br@@ is which led to the av@@ al@@ an@@ che of 1973 , yet it nonetheless brought him down as well .
he never found his way back , and when confronted with the new politics of prim@@ aries and popul@@ ism , he became disp@@ ir@@ ited when he could not cope with this new style .
in the international arena , eb@@ an &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s pen was his s@@ word , and the spoken word his l@@ ance .
he was less ade@@ pt in political inf@@ igh@@ ting in isra@@ el .
he could be a fi@@ erce tur@@ f figh@@ ter , yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and do@@ v@@ ish views in the post-@@ 1967 government in which he served .
it is far from clear if he would have prev@@ ailed , given his lack of an independent political base , but his international pres@@ tige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the ga@@ un@@ t@@ let .
he never did .
eb@@ an &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s silence in the last years was not only a product of his dis@@ enchan@@ tment with isra@@ eli politics or his failing health .
at a time when public debate in isra@@ el is tor@@ n between p@@ seu@@ do-@@ religious nation@@ alist fan@@ atics and anti-@@ zion@@ ists mas@@ quer@@ ading as post-@@ modernis@@ ts , the moral certi@@ tudes of eb@@ an , for all their urban@@ ity , may sound shal@@ low .
but nation@@ -@@ building requires moral stam@@ ina , and eb@@ an provided it to his people and the world in abund@@ ance .
without having spoken to eb@@ an in the last few years , i have no doubt that he would be extremely un@@ happy about the turn of events after the failure of camp da@@ vi@@ d and tab@@ a in 2000-@@ 01 , and the present course of isra@@ eli policies would fill him with fore@@ bo@@ ding .
yet in all prob@@ ability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the in@@ ability of the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans to come to terms with the existence of the je@@ wish state .
as an arab@@ ist by training , immer@@ sed in ar@@ ab and mus@@ li@@ m culture , he always hoped that the gl@@ orious ar@@ ab past could be re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ated , that an ar@@ ab and mus@@ li@@ m culture of tolerance could tri@@ ump@@ h over fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism and extremis@@ m .
this was the bed@@ rock of his hope for reconciliation between je@@ w and ar@@ ab .
that this ar@@ ab ren@@ a@@ issance - to use the phrase of the great pal@@ est@@ inian schol@@ ar ge@@ or@@ ge ant@@ oni@@ us - did not take place may have been eb@@ an &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s greatest dis@@ appointment .
despite the high-@@ born image eb@@ an projected , he was an extremely vulnerable person : what some occasionally disc@@ ern@@ ed as tra@@ its of van@@ ity may have had their origins in his hum@@ ble origins .
while appearing to own the qu@@ een &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s english , eb@@ an was not to the man@@ or born : he came from the extremely modest fr@@ ing@@ es of ang@@ lo@@ -@@ je@@ w@@ ry .
he was , in the true sense of the word , a self-@@ made man , whose p@@ luck , ambition , drive and inner belief in his dest@@ iny carried him to the p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le of his achievements .
his was the ar@@ isto@@ c@@ racy of the spirit .
in this ab@@ ba eb@@ an was a true representative of the people he so gl@@ ori@@ ously represented .
the missing ar@@ row of ab@@ en@@ om@@ ics
to@@ k@@ yo – in his drive to ki@@ ck-@@ start the jap@@ anese economy , prime minister sh@@ in@@ zo abe , shortly after taking office in 2012 , introduced a large fiscal stimulus and put in place a bold program of monetary eas@@ ing .
since then , jap@@ anese policymakers have been working to launch what abe calls the third “ ar@@ row ” of his agenda : ar@@ du@@ ous reforms of key industries and the demo@@ lition of structural barriers to growth .
but the focus on public policy has left a “ fourth ar@@ row ” – the private sector – un@@ touched and seem@@ ingly ignored .
this is unfortunate , because the government cannot fix jap@@ an ’ s ills on its own .
annual productivity growth has been stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish , rarely rising above 2 % for much of the past two decades , reflecting both missed opportunities and declining cost competitiveness .
jap@@ an ’ s productivity sl@@ ump per@@ me@@ ates the entire economy ; labor and capital productivity gains have nearly st@@ alled in almost every sector – even in jap@@ an ’ s signature advanced manufacturing industries .
labor productivity in the transpor@@ t-@@ equipment sector , for example , is barely half that of ger@@ many .
this trend puts annual g@@ d@@ p growth on course to average only 1.3 % through 20@@ 25 , im@@ plying a third consec@@ utive decade of stag@@ nation .
such an outcome would coinci@@ de with – and exacerb@@ ate the effects of – an adverse demographic shift that will constra@@ in fiscal revenues and drive up costs for universal health care and pension benefits .
jap@@ an ’ s ability to alter its tra@@ jec@@ tory depends on individual companies making decisions to invest , change workplace policies , deplo@@ y new technologies , and test un@@ tried business models .
abe ’ s structural reforms will take time and political will to en@@ act , but jap@@ anese companies cannot afford to sit still .
they can and must act , without waiting for the government to change its policies .
in many cases , the economy ’ s bott@@ len@@ ecks are not regulatory in nature , but stem from entr@@ en@@ ched ways of doing business .
new research by the m@@ ck@@ in@@ sey global institute exam@@ ines jap@@ an ’ s advanced manufacturing , retail , financial services , and heal@@ th-@@ care industries in detail – and finds substantial un@@ ta@@ pped productivity potential in every area .
for star@@ ters , jap@@ anese firms must become more globally integrated .
exporting to the fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing overseas markets is one obvious route to over@@ coming s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish demand growth at home .
but , rather than just selling products abroad , jap@@ anese enterprises need to expand operations beyond their borders and cast a wider net for international talent .
jap@@ anese companies have form@@ id@@ able r &@@ amp@@ ; d operations , but most will need to re@@ configure them to obtain better returns and impact .
the process must start with an understanding of what the customer wants and a determination to deliver solutions accordingly .
closed and tigh@@ tly managed r &@@ amp@@ ; d operations must be transformed into more flu@@ id , open processes involving collaboration with customers and suppliers .
jap@@ anese companies will also need to improve their capabilities in areas such as marketing , pricing , and talent development .
while there are some po@@ ckets of excellence , most jap@@ anese firms are severely lacking in these areas .
to compete in global markets , they will need to achieve the same consistency in these areas that they have in their traditional areas of strength .
many jap@@ anese companies have yet to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze pap@@ er-@@ based processes and replace out@@ dated inform@@ ation-@@ technology systems .
others would benefit from moving beyond basic di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ation to ne@@ x@@ t-@@ generation technologies , such as big@@ -@@ data analy@@ tics .
companies can also head off lo@@ oming labor short@@ ages with intelligent software systems and ro@@ bo@@ tics .
manufacturers can au@@ gment or replace their assembly lines with technologies such as the internet of things and 3@@ d printing .
more broadly , jap@@ anese companies have to organize for performance and discipline .
as policy changes un@@ le@@ ash market forces , businesses will face greater competition .
some may need to re@@ organize or exit un@@ profitable markets ; others may have to undertake mergers and acqu@@ isi@@ tions to achieve economies of scale .
finally , shareholders and senior exec@@ u@@ tives should tie performance goals to incentives .
some of jap@@ an ’ s corporate gi@@ ants have already begun shi@@ fting from traditional sen@@ i@@ or@@ ity-@@ based adv@@ ancement toward mer@@ it@@ -based pay structures .
others should follow their lead .
promoting younger and more diverse talent can create agi@@ le organizations with fresh ideas .
if jap@@ an ’ s private sector rises to the challenge , it can move the economy onto a path of faster growth .
innovations in one company would cas@@ c@@ ade across its entire industry by forcing competitors to raise their game .
in the 195@@ 0s and 196@@ 0s , for example , to@@ yo@@ ta introduced more efficient production processes that were eventually adopted by the entire automobile industry .
instead of sett@@ ling for a future of 1.3 % annual g@@ d@@ p growth , jap@@ an could at@@ tain roughly 3 % annual growth through 20@@ 25 .
doing so would require the growth rate of labor productivity to more than double , but this is an at@@ tain@@ able goal .
more than half of this growth incre@@ ment can be met by adopting best practices that companies around the world already use , while technology can close much of the remaining gap .
jap@@ anese business leaders need to combine big thinking with a focused attention to detail .
they will need to create innovative products , penet@@ rate new markets , and make bold investments in equipment , technology , and talent , while simultaneously scrut@@ ini@@ zing every aspect of their operations for in@@ efficiency and waste .
traditional ways of doing business may have to be abandoned .
but there is ample scope to make progress and sp@@ ur faster economic growth .
immense trade flows , the rise of billions of new consumers in the emerging world , and technology break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s are rapidly trans@@ forming the global economy .
jap@@ an can shift its current tra@@ jec@@ tory by turning this wave of dis@@ ruption into opportunity .
a ber@@ lin consensus ?
h@@ ong kon@@ g – a recent trip to ber@@ lin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967 , when i was a poor student who mar@@ vel@@ ed at the wall that would divide and dev@@ ast@@ ate an entire society for another two decades .
ber@@ lin today is vibrant and re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ated , re@@ built by the german peoples &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; hard work and sacrifi@@ ce to uni@@ fy the country , and an ap@@ t setting for the conference of the institute for new economic thinking ( inet ) , which i was there to attend .
the conference ’ s theme was “ para@@ dig@@ m lost , ” with more than 300 economists , political scientists , systems an@@ al@@ yst@@ s , and ec@@ ologists gathering to re@@ think economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality , rising unemployment , global financial dis@@ array , and climate change .
almost everyone agreed that the old para@@ dig@@ m of ne@@ oc@@ las@@ sical economics was broken , but there was no agreement on what can replace it .
no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate am@@ art@@ ya sen attributed the europ@@ ean crisis to four failures – political , economic , social , and intellectual .
the global financial crisis , which began in 2007 as a crisis of us sub@@ prime lending and has bro@@ a@@ dened into a europ@@ ean sovereign@@ -@@ debt ( and banking ) crisis , has raised questions that we cannot answer , owing to over-@@ speci@@ alization and frag@@ mentation of knowledge .
and yet there is no den@@ ying that the world has become too in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate for any simple , over@@ ar@@ ching theory to explain complex economic , technological , demographic , and environmental shi@@ fts .
in particular , the rise of emerging markets has challeng@@ ed traditional western deduc@@ tive and in@@ duc@@ tive logic .
deduc@@ tive in@@ ference enables us to pre@@ dict effects if we know the principles ( the rule ) and the cause .
by in@@ duc@@ tive reason@@ ing , if we know the cause and effects , we can in@@ fer the principles .
eastern thinking , by contrast , has been ab@@ duc@@ tive , moving from pragmati@@ s@@ m to gu@@ essing the next steps .
ab@@ duc@@ tive in@@ ference is pragmatic , looking only at outcomes , gu@@ essing at the rule , and identifying the cause .
like history , soci@@ al-@@ scientific theory is written by the vic@@ tors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time .
free-@@ market thinking evol@@ ved from ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on the@@ or@@ ists ( many from sco@@ t@@ land ) , who mig@@ rated and colon@@ ized territories , allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption .
europ@@ ean continental thinking , responding to ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation and the need for social order , empha@@ sized institutional analysis of political economy .
thus , the emergence of ne@@ oc@@ las@@ sical economics in the nine@@ teenth century was very much influenced by new@@ ton@@ ian and car@@ t@@ esian physi@@ cs , moving from qualitative analysis to quanti@@ fying human behavior by assu@@ ming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty .
this “ pre@@ determined equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um ” thinking – reflected in the view that markets always self-@@ correct – led to policy par@@ aly@@ sis until the great de@@ pression , when j@@ oh@@ n ma@@ yn@@ ard ke@@ yn@@ es ’ s argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained tra@@ ction .
by the 1970 ’ s , the ne@@ oc@@ las@@ sical gener@@ al-@@ equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um school captured ke@@ yn@@ esian economics through real-@@ sector models that assumed that “ finance is a v@@ eil , ” thereby becoming blind to financial markets ’ dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing effects .
economists like hy@@ man min@@ sky , who tried to correct this , were largely ignored as mil@@ ton fried@@ man and others led the profession ’ s push for free markets and minimal government intervention .
but then technology , demo@@ graphics , and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the ne@@ oc@@ las@@ sical approach could not fore@@ see .
even as the world ’ s advanced countries over-@@ consu@@ med through le@@ ver@@ aging from deriv@@ ative finance , four billion of the world ’ s seven billion people began moving to mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income status , making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability .
new thinking is required to manage these massive and system@@ ic changes , as well as the integration of gi@@ ants like ch@@ ina and indi@@ a into the modern world .
a change of min@@ d@@ set is needed not just in the west , but also in the east .
in 1987 , the hist@@ orian ray hu@@ ang explained it for ch@@ ina :
“ as the world enters the modern era , most countries under internal and external pressure need to re@@ construct themselves by sub@@ stit@@ uting the mode of governance roo@@ ted in ag@@ r@@ arian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce . … this is easier said than done .
the renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers , and inevitably it is necessary to re@@ condition the institutional links between them .
comprehensive destruction is often the order ; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion . ”
using this macro-@@ historical framework , we can see jap@@ anese de@@ flation , europ@@ ean debt , and even the ar@@ ab spring as phases of system@@ ic changes within complex structures that are inter@@ acting with one another in a new , multi@@ pol@@ ar global system .
we are witness@@ ing simultane@@ ous global convergence ( the narro@@ wing of income , wealth , and knowledge gaps between countries ) and local diver@@ gence ( wi@@ dening income , wealth , and knowledge gaps within countries ) .
adap@@ tive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evol@@ ve .
as the phil@@ osop@@ her ber@@ tr@@ and r@@ ussel@@ l pres@@ ci@@ ently put it : “ security and justice require centr@@ alized governmental control , which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective .
progress , on the contrary , requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order . ”
a new wave of what the econom@@ ist jo@@ se@@ ph sch@@ ump@@ eter fam@@ ously called “ creative destruction ” is under way : even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by floo@@ ding markets with liquidity , credit to business and households is shr@@ in@@ king .
we live in an age of simultane@@ ous fear of inflation and de@@ flation ; of unprecedented prosperity am@@ id growing inequality ; and of technological adv@@ ancement and resource deple@@ tion .
mean@@ while , existing political systems promise good jobs , sound governance , a sustainable environment , and social harmony without sacrifi@@ ce – a paradise of self-@@ interested free ri@@ ders that can be sustained only by sacri@@ fic@@ ing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations .
we cannot postp@@ one the pain of adjustment forever by printing money .
sustainability can be achieved only when the ha@@ ves become willing to sacrifi@@ ce for the ha@@ ve-@@ no@@ ts .
the wash@@ ington consensus of free-@@ market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago .
the inet conference in ber@@ lin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifi@@ ce in the interest of unity .
europ@@ e could use it .
a better and safer europ@@ e
to many , myself included , nat@@ o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s enlargement to take in , among others , the bal@@ tic states of est@@ onia , lat@@ via , and li@@ thu@@ ania -- which were once so@@ vi@@ et re@@ public@@ s -- is an impossible dream come true .
when the idea was first flo@@ ated some 10 years ago , expansion into the bal@@ tics was taken seriously by few people .
until recently , rus@@ sia &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle , because it shar@@ pen@@ ed the impression that rus@@ sia regarded its so-called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; near abroad &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; as a zone of special interest and influence .
nat@@ o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new europ@@ e can be regarded as part of another country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; zone . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
it assu@@ res the three small bal@@ tic countries that the night@@ mare of occupation by big neigh@@ b@@ ors ( hit@@ ler &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s reich and stal@@ in &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s uss@@ r ) , which they endu@@ red for half-@@ a-@@ century -- will not be repeated .
by putting paid to any re@@ van@@ ch@@ ist tenden@@ cies in rus@@ sia concerning the bal@@ tics , europ@@ e is made a safer place , and rus@@ sia is helped in its effort to re@@ define itself as a national state and not an emp@@ ire .
expansion will also create a better europ@@ e because enlargement wi@@ dens the territory in which countries are committed to nat@@ o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s political values , including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities .
fortunately rus@@ sia now seems to gras@@ p the value of this political aspect of nat@@ o-@@ enlargement .
rightly so : enlargement of nat@@ o is not an &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; expansion &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that threat@@ ens rus@@ sia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms .
on the contrary , expansion takes away the wor@@ ries - be they real or imagin@@ ed - that surro@@ und the situation of the large rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking populations that now live outside of rus@@ sia but within the borders of the former so@@ vi@@ et union .
the civil rights of the rus@@ sian minorities in the bal@@ tics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law , due in no small part to nat@@ o demands .
those civil rights initiatives on the part of nat@@ o reflect the increasingly work@@ man@@ like way that rus@@ sia , europ@@ e , and ameri@@ ca now work out their dis@@ agreements .
indeed , enlargement of nat@@ o comes only a few days after a deal was struck between rus@@ sia and the eu on the tri@@ cky question of access to the rus@@ sian en@@ cla@@ ve of kal@@ in@@ ingrad .
this small piece of rus@@ sia , with 1 million inhabitants and bor@@ dering on the bal@@ tic sea , is squ@@ ee@@ zed between pol@@ and and li@@ thu@@ ania , two future members of the eu .
this could have inc@@ ited a complicated situation where rus@@ si@@ ans were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between kal@@ in@@ ingrad and rus@@ sia proper .
a deal was struck between president pu@@ tin and the eu that makes access much easier without com@@ promising the status of li@@ thu@@ ania and pol@@ and within the eu@@ -@@ regime .
this , in turn , created once again the kind of win@@ -@@ win situation that is so important for future relations between the eu and rus@@ sia .
when the enlargement of the eu into central and eastern europ@@ e is finally decided by the europ@@ ean council in cop@@ enhagen next month , the conclusion is clear : europ@@ e has become a much better and safer place to live in , thanks to the decisions taken by nat@@ o and the eu during the crucial autumn of 2002 .
but this is no cause for com@@ plac@@ ency . for the really hard work is only now beginning : dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlar@@ gements will bring , as well as reck@@ oning with countries in the membership waiting rooms , in particular rus@@ sia .
relations with rus@@ sia are of vital importance if europ@@ e is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety .
the common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly .
we need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights .
kal@@ in@@ ingrad could be a lit@@ mus test of these relations .
the first hur@@ dle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the en@@ cla@@ ve .
the next hur@@ dle is to support kal@@ ingrad &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures .
this calls for gener@@ osity from the eu and flexibility from mo@@ sco@@ w .
in a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called northern dimension of the eu , where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the bal@@ tic sea .
such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asser@@ ts itself .
only a few years ago eu and nat@@ o enlargement were regarded as wild dreams .
but determination and political will has now made the dreams come true .
now is the time to set new ambitious goals for europ@@ e .
a better way to reduce nuclear risks
in 1977 , when i served in president j@@ im@@ my car@@ ter &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s state department , i was sent to indi@@ a to dis@@ su@@ ade that country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s leaders from developing a nuclear bom@@ b .
my hosts rep@@ lied that they needed to keep up with ch@@ ina .
i said that pak@@ istan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe .
indi@@ a promised that it would not export its weapons technology .
so far as we know , its leaders have kept their word .
but re@@ vel@@ ations about the nuclear weapons smug@@ gling network organized by a. q@@ . k@@ han , the father of pak@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s bom@@ b , confirm the danger i predic@@ ted back then .
some call k@@ han &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s network an effort to spread an &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; islam@@ ic bom@@ b , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; but given that north korea was on the list of recipi@@ ents along with li@@ b@@ ya and ir@@ an , it might better be ter@@ med a cor@@ rupt bom@@ b .
as events in pak@@ istan illustr@@ ate , the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deter@@ r@@ ence .
rather , it increases the prospects of cor@@ rupt le@@ ak@@ age that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons .
that makes everyone less safe .
any path@@ ological group of extremis@@ ts could destroy new del@@ hi , to@@ k@@ yo , par@@ is , or any city they chose .
now the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s attention is foc@@ uss@@ ed on ir@@ an , one recipient of pak@@ ist@@ ani technology , as the country seem@@ ingly ke@@ en@@ est to create its own nuclear ar@@ senal .
according to the international atom@@ ic energy agency ( i@@ ae@@ a ) , ir@@ an began enrich@@ ing ur@@ anium at a pilot cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge plant last aug@@ ust , and is construc@@ ting larger underground enrich@@ ment facilities .
ir@@ an proc@@ laim@@ s that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy , but inspec@@ tors have already found tra@@ ces of highly enrich@@ ed weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade ur@@ anium .
last oc@@ tober , mo@@ ham@@ ed el bar@@ ade@@ i , the head of the i@@ ae@@ a , announced that ir@@ an had accepted enhanced inspection procedures .
in addition , after visits by the f@@ ren@@ ch , bri@@ tish , and german foreign ministers , ir@@ an announced a temporary suspension of its enrich@@ ment program .
now it hin@@ ts that it may resume enrich@@ ment , and recent press reports about the imports from pak@@ istan suggest ir@@ an failed to disc@@ lose everything to the i@@ ae@@ a .
ir@@ an claims that as a party to the non-@@ proliferation treaty , it has the right to en@@ rich ur@@ anium for peaceful purposes .
correct , because the n@@ pt was born with a lo@@ op@@ hole .
even if a country agrees to broad ranging i@@ ae@@ a inspections , it can legally accumul@@ ate enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium ( or re@@ processed pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um ) under the gu@@ ise of a peaceful energy program , and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice .
if ir@@ an did this , it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region , but would likely begin a process of un@@ ra@@ v@@ elling the non-@@ proliferation regime worldwide .
ir@@ an may ask what right others have to demand that it fo@@ reg@@ o nuclear weapons .
the answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the n@@ pt and in the consequences that it would impose on others .
for these reasons , president b@@ ush declared an ir@@ anian nuclear weapon unacceptable .
however , ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s unilateral options are limited .
not only is the us military busy trying in i@@ ra@@ q , but the way the us went into i@@ ra@@ q - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than ir@@ an - under@@ mined ameri@@ can credibility , making it difficult to recru@@ it allies to contain ir@@ an &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s nuclear ambitions .
fortunately , there is a multilateral option and an existing prece@@ dent .
in the mid-@@ 1970 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s , many parties to the n@@ pt planned to import and develop enrich@@ ment and re@@ processing facilities .
re@@ alizing the threat to the non-@@ proliferation regime , countries as diverse as the so@@ vi@@ et union , fran@@ ce , ger@@ many , and jap@@ an formed a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; nuclear suppliers group &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that restra@@ ined the export of enrich@@ ment and re@@ processing facilities .
that plug@@ ged part of the lo@@ op@@ hole in the treaty without amending it .
today , such countries should join together to offer ir@@ an ( and others ) a deal .
countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bom@@ bs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel .
for example , rus@@ sia , which is helping ir@@ an construct a nuclear re@@ actor at b@@ ush@@ ehr , should offer ir@@ an a guarantee of low enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium fuel and re@@ processing of the re@@ actor &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s spent fuel by sending it back to rus@@ sia if ir@@ an agrees to fo@@ reg@@ o enrich@@ ment and re@@ processing .
this deal could then be given te@@ eth by the un security council .
the council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace , and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions .
such a resolution would also include a car@@ rot by guaranteeing ir@@ an access to the non-@@ dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle .
the pot could be further swe@@ et@@ ened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if ir@@ an remains non-@@ nuclear .
europ@@ ean foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about ir@@ an &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s nuclear program .
it is time for the security council to try to internation@@ alize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle .
it is not too late to learn the lessons of the mis@@ advent@@ ures of a. q@@ . k@@ han .
a big chance for small farmers
new y@@ or@@ k – the g-@@ 8 ’ s $ 20 billion initiative on small@@ holder agriculture , launched at the group ’ s recent summit in l ’ aqu@@ ila , ital@@ y , is a potentially historic break@@ through in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty .
with serious management of the new funds , food production in afri@@ ca will so@@ ar .
indeed , the new initiative , combined with others in health , education , and infrastructure , could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals , the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty , disease , and hunger by half by 2015 .
during 200@@ 2-@@ 2006 , i led the united nations mill@@ enni@@ um project , which aimed to achieve the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals , for th@@ en-@@ un secret@@ ary general ko@@ fi ann@@ an .
one corner@@ stone of the project was “ small@@ holder farmers , ” meaning pe@@ as@@ ant farm families in afri@@ ca , l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , and a@@ sia – working farms of around one hec@@ t@@ are ( 2.5 acres ) or less .
these are some of the poorest households in the world , and , ir@@ on@@ ically , some of the hung@@ ri@@ est as well , despite being food producers .
they are hung@@ ry because they lack the ability to buy high-@@ yield seeds , fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er , ir@@ rig@@ ation equipment , and other tools needed to increase productivity .
as a result , their output is me@@ ager and insufficient for their sub@@ sist@@ ence .
their poverty causes low farm productivity , and low farm productivity rein@@ forces their poverty .
it ’ s a vi@@ cious circle , technically known as a poverty tra@@ p .
many of us , notably current un secret@@ ary general ban ki@@ -@@ moon , have worked hard to make this possible , with ban repeatedly empha@@ si@@ zing the special emergency arising from the global food , financial , and energy crises of the past two years .
the g-@@ 8 announcement reflects these years of effort , and of course the boost from the leadership of us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama , span@@ ish prime minister jo@@ se lu@@ is z@@ ap@@ ater@@ o , au@@ str@@ ali@@ an prime minister k@@ ev@@ in ru@@ dd , world bank president ro@@ bert zo@@ el@@ lick , europ@@ ean commission@@ er lou@@ is mi@@ ch@@ el , europ@@ ean parlia@@ ment@@ arian thi@@ j@@ s ber@@ man , and others .
now the key is to make this effort work .
the lessons of history are clear .
getting seed and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er to small@@ holder farmers at highly subsidi@@ zed prices ( or even free in some cases ) will make a lasting difference .
not only will food yiel@@ ds rise in the short term , but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumul@@ ate all sorts of assets : cash balances , soil nutri@@ ents , farm animals , and their children ’ s health and education .
that boost in assets will , in turn , enable local credit markets , such as micro-@@ finance , to begin operating .
farmers will be able to buy in@@ puts , either out of their own cash , or by borro@@ wing against their improved credi@@ t@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
a consensus has now been reached on the need to assist small@@ holders , but obstacles remain .
perhaps the main risk is that the “ aid bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cies ” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $ 20 billion , so that much of it gets taken up by meetings , expert consultations , over@@ head , reports , and further meetings . “ partnerships ” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves , merely dela@@ ying real action .
if donor governments really want results , they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cies and pool it in one or two places , the most logical being the world bank in wash@@ ington and the international fund for agricultural development ( i@@ f@@ ad ) in ro@@ me .
one or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars .
governments in hung@@ er-@@ stri@@ cken regions , especially afri@@ ca , would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-@@ yield seeds , fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er , ir@@ rig@@ ation , farm tools , storage si@@ los , and local advice to im@@ pover@@ ished farmers .
an independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and man@@ ag@@ erial coherence .
assu@@ ming that a plan passes muster , the money to support it would quickly be dis@@ bur@@ sed .
after@@ ward , each national program would be monitored , audi@@ ted , and evaluated .
this approach is straight@@ forward , efficient , accountable , and scienti@@ fically sound .
two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach : the global alliance on vacc@@ ines and imm@@ uni@@ z@@ ations , which successfully gets imm@@ uni@@ z@@ ations to young children , and the global fund to fight aids , t@@ b , and malaria , which supports national action plans to battle these kil@@ ler diseases .
both have saved millions of lives during the past decade , and have pav@@ ed the way to a new more efficient and scienti@@ fically sound method of development assistance .
not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , many un agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach .
all too often , the fight is about tur@@ f , rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor .
ob@@ ama , ru@@ dd , z@@ ap@@ ater@@ o , and other forwar@@ d-@@ thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their ple@@ dges at the g-@@ 8 and insist@@ ing that the aid really works .
the bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cies must be b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed to get help to where it is needed : in the soil till@@ ed by the world ’ s poorest farm families .
new y@@ or@@ k – in the afternoon of ju@@ ly 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of cam@@ bridge , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts .
al@@ er@@ ted by a telephone call , a polic@@ em@@ an arrived sm@@ ar@@ tly on the scene .
he saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out .
the man refused .
he was then told to identify himself .
the man , still ref@@ using to step out , said he was a har@@ v@@ ard professor , showed his id , and warned the co@@ p not to m@@ ess with him .
he said something about black men in ameri@@ ca being sin@@ gl@@ ed out , and asked the co@@ p , who was white , for his name and identification .
the co@@ p , joined by several colleagues , arrested the professor for dis@@ order@@ ly conduct .
we now know that the professor had broken into his own home , with the help of his ch@@ auff@@ eur , because the door was j@@ am@@ med .
what was unusual here was not the co@@ p ’ s heav@@ y-@@ han@@ de@@ dness .
most people in the us know that if you talk back to the police , they will get n@@ asty very fast .
the fact that the man was black might or might not have made the co@@ p go for his hand@@ cu@@ ffs even sooner than he might normally have done .
that , too , would not have been unusual .
what made this case special was that hen@@ ry lou@@ is “ ski@@ p ” g@@ ates is one of the most celebrated prof@@ essors in the country , famous for his books , his articles , and numerous television appe@@ ar@@ ances .
he is a gran@@ de@@ e , a mo@@ ver and sha@@ ker in the academic and media world , a friend of president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama . that is why he warned the co@@ p , s@@ g@@ t. j@@ ames cro@@ wle@@ y , a veter@@ an of the cam@@ bridge police force , not to m@@ ess with him .
in this instance , it is impossible to pr@@ y them apart .
g@@ ates , deeply conscious , indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country , inst@@ inc@@ tively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice .
from his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished har@@ v@@ ard professor and media celeb@@ r@@ ity . as he put it to his daughter in an interview published online : “ &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; cro@@ wle@@ y &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; should have gotten out of there and said , ‘ i ’ m sorry , si@@ r , good luck .
loved your &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; television &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; series — check with you later ! ’ ”
al@@ as , s@@ g@@ t.@@ cro@@ wle@@ y had never heard of professor g@@ ates . a local man whose bro@@ thers all serve in the police force , a sports fan , and an am@@ ateur bas@@ ket@@ ball coach , cro@@ wle@@ y does not move in the same social cir@@ cles as g@@ ates .
as it happens , the charges were duly dropped , and there the case might have re@@ sted if president ob@@ ama , ti@@ red and frustr@@ ated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill , had not weigh@@ ed in on behalf of his “ friend ” g@@ ates , and called the police “ st@@ up@@ id . ”
both he and g@@ ates then spoke of “ learning ” from the incident .
one thing to be learned , if we didn ’ t know this already , is how close ra@@ cial sensi@@ tivi@@ ties are to the surface of us life , despite the election of a black president .
the comple@@ xi@@ ties of black anger , white guil@@ t , and of black , and white fear , are so v@@ ex@@ ed that most ameri@@ cans prefer not to talk about race at all . the field is too full of mines .
one of ob@@ ama ’ s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the bril@@ liance and sub@@ t@@ le@@ ty of his rhetoric .
and there remains plenty to talk about : the gro@@ tes@@ qu@@ ely disproportionate number of black men in us pris@@ ons ; the lack of educational opportunities in poor , mostly black areas ; the app@@ alling healthcare system ; and the very real brut@@ ality used by police officers against bl@@ acks , who don ’ t have the privi@@ lege of a har@@ v@@ ard id .
it is probably true that many white polic@@ emen , even if they are trained to avoid ra@@ cial pro@@ fil@@ ing , as s@@ g@@ t. cro@@ wle@@ y was , need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the fin@@ er houses of cam@@ bridge , or any other ameri@@ can city .
but is the g@@ ates affair the right way to enter into this discussion ?
one might argue that it was . if not professor g@@ ates , then who ?
precisely because he is a gran@@ de@@ e , he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue .
if the same thing had happened to an unknown man in har@@ lem , or some other poor , or predomin@@ antly black district , no one would ever have heard about it .
the fact that it happened to a professor in cam@@ bridge makes everyone sit up and take notice .
there is , however , a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race .
by having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event g@@ ates could be accused of tri@@ vi@@ alizing much worse instances of abuse .
indeed , we don ’ t even know for certain whether this was such an instance .
cro@@ wle@@ y never mentioned the color of g@@ ates ’ skin .
there was no question of violence . there were just very raw ner@@ ves and hyper@@ sensitivity to hin@@ ts of dis@@ respect , on the part of the professor , and of the co@@ p .
ou@@ tra@@ ge about a professor who is not to be mess@@ ed with is not the best way to discuss the p@@ light of countless , poor , an@@ onymous people , whom most of us find it too easy to ignore .
a b@@ oll@@ y@@ wood bri@@ de for s@@ arko@@ zy ?
par@@ is -- ever since f@@ ren@@ ch president ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy took himself off his country ’ s mo@@ st-@@ eli@@ gi@@ ble-@@ b@@ achel@@ or list by publicly acknowled@@ ging his affair with super@@ model@@ -@@ tur@@ ne@@ d-@@ pop@@ -@@ musi@@ cian car@@ la brun@@ i during a romantic trip to euro dis@@ ney , he ’ s run into trouble .
his rat@@ ings have di@@ pped below 50 % for the first time .
older f@@ ren@@ ch citizens don ’ t find the public spectac@@ le of their leader in love very am@@ using .
abroad , eg@@ yp@@ tian law@@ makers were so exercised over the prospect of the f@@ ren@@ ch head of state sharing a bed with his gir@@ l@@ friend that several v@@ ented their dis@@ approval on the floor of the parliament .
likewise , indi@@ a is all in a qu@@ and@@ ary over how to handle protocol during s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s im@@ pending visit to the sub@@ continent as the guest of honor at the country ’ s re@@ public day celeb@@ rations on jan@@ u@@ ary 26 .
should the first gir@@ l@@ friend have her own motor@@ c@@ ade , as a first la@@ dy would ?
mean@@ while , the same har@@ d-@@ right hin@@ du groups that protest val@@ ent@@ ine ’ s day as a dec@@ a@@ dent western holiday have warned that if s@@ arko@@ zy arri@@ ves with his gir@@ l@@ friend in to@@ w , they ’ ll be out in the streets to welcome him .
this contro@@ vers@@ y has threatened to cast a p@@ all over a mu@@ ch-@@ her@@ al@@ ded summit between two of the world ’ s great democracies .
with lu@@ cr@@ ative deals at stake for the big@@ -@@ ticket products that drive the f@@ ren@@ ch economy – military hardware , nuclear power plants , and air@@ bus plan@@ es – fran@@ ce has a strong interest in a successful summit in indi@@ a .
so , as rum@@ ors fly of secret marriage cerem@@ on@@ ies either already concluded or in the works , could the trouble bre@@ wing in indi@@ a over the f@@ ren@@ ch president ’ s very public love life be behind the r@@ ush to have the couple legally wed ?
the news in s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s favo@@ red media out@@ let journ@@ al du di@@ manche that the couple plan to mar@@ ry touched off a fl@@ urr@@ y of fe@@ ver@@ ed speculation on when the happy event might occur .
the couple ex@@ changed significant to@@ k@@ ens of their mutual affec@@ tion : he offered her a hear@@ t-@@ shaped p@@ ink diam@@ ond ring by di@@ or , she offered him a s@@ wis@@ s watch .
it ’ s “ serious , ” the s@@ mitten president admitted .
“ you ’ ll probably find out after it ’ s happened , ” he ta@@ un@@ ted .
rum@@ or has it the couple has set f@@ ebru@@ ary 8 or 9 for the wedding . others say that s@@ arko@@ zy has already ou@@ ts@@ mar@@ ted the media by secre@@ tly mar@@ rying in the el@@ y@@ see palace , even as he was do@@ dging wedding questions .
if that is true , then s@@ arko@@ zy missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime .
if the couple si@@ zz@@ led for cameras with lux@@ or and pet@@ ra as the backdrop , just imagine how hot things could get at the most romantic spot on earth , the ta@@ j mah@@ al .
and , given the current rage for all things b@@ oll@@ y@@ wood in fran@@ ce , a lav@@ ish indi@@ an wedding would be fitting .
brun@@ i ’ s own life path closely resem@@ bles any number of b@@ oll@@ y@@ wood stars who have made the transition from model to act@@ ress .
a com@@ ely brun@@ ette who sings is perfect for a b@@ oll@@ y@@ wood ma@@ ke@@ over .
the indi@@ an government will be nothing if not relie@@ ved to see the first gir@@ l@@ friend made a wife .
as one of indi@@ a ’ s leading daily newspapers , the indi@@ an express , sp@@ elled it out , l@@ est anyone be conf@@ used , “ a gir@@ l@@ friend is not a wife or sp@@ ouse . ” once wed , all protocol wor@@ ries about the f@@ ren@@ ch delegation would simply disappear .
despite the sometimes down@@ right porno@@ graphic on-@@ screen w@@ ri@@ thing of b@@ oll@@ y@@ wood star@@ lets , indi@@ a is still a deeply conservative society .
di@@ vor@@ ce is an@@ a@@ thema .
( s@@ arko@@ zy is now twice di@@ vor@@ ced . )
and , while m@@ ist@@ res@@ ses abo@@ und among the privileged classes , they do not stru@@ t publicly by their power@@ -@@ m@@ ates ’ sides .
k@@ is@@ sing and fon@@ d@@ ling in public , even by sp@@ ouses , is t@@ abo@@ o .
in this respect , indi@@ a more resem@@ bles the fran@@ ce with which s@@ arko@@ zy wants to make a clean break than the current one .
most indi@@ ans , as it seems many f@@ ren@@ ch , would prefer not to shed the “ hypo@@ cris@@ y ” s@@ arko@@ zy la@@ ments on the part of his predec@@ essors ( read : former f@@ ren@@ ch president fran@@ ç@@ ois mit@@ ter@@ r@@ and , who had a child with his m@@ ist@@ ress about whom the public knew nothing until the man ’ s fun@@ er@@ al ) .
s@@ arko@@ zy , of all people , should know that a large part of the gra@@ vit@@ as of office deri@@ ves from p@@ om@@ p and circum@@ stance .
stat@@ ec@@ raft is a real@@ m where appe@@ ar@@ ances are meant to be dec@@ ei@@ ving .
when s@@ arko@@ zy , who otherwise has such fin@@ ely tun@@ ed media inst@@ inc@@ ts , protests that he ’ s no different from any other man , he comes danger@@ ously close to conf@@ using the office and the person of the president .
most f@@ ren@@ ch people could only dream of an exotic wedding in indi@@ a .
s@@ arko@@ zy could make that dream come true .
if he really is as head@@ -@@ over-@@ he@@ els in love with brun@@ i as he claims , and plans to mar@@ ry her im@@ min@@ ently , why not take advantage of his upcoming trip to indi@@ a and make this a wedding to remember ?
he could meet his bri@@ de se@@ ated maj@@ es@@ tically on the cap@@ ar@@ ison of an elabor@@ ately decorated el@@ eph@@ ant , and she would look ra@@ v@@ ishing s@@ wa@@ th@@ ed and be@@ je@@ wel@@ ed in indi@@ an fin@@ ery .
the “ bl@@ ing-@@ bling ” president , as s@@ arko@@ zy has been du@@ b@@ bed , can wear all the gold he wants and he@@ ap yet more diam@@ onds on his bri@@ de .
the cameras would roll , indi@@ ans would s@@ mile , and fran@@ ce would be treated to a b@@ oll@@ y@@ wood spectac@@ le beyond its wil@@ dest dreams .
and if it ’ s too late for the wedding , there ’ s always the reception .
a bom@@ b in every re@@ actor
ber@@ lin – twenty-@@ five years after the nuclear disaster at cher@@ nobyl , the ongoing catastro@@ phe at the fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima nuclear re@@ actor in jap@@ an has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the pur@@ ported bl@@ es@@ sings of the nuclear age are mere illu@@ sions : nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap .
moreover , the alternatives to nuclear energy – and to fossil fuels – are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable .
taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity ; it is a deliber@@ ate political choice .
fossi@@ l-@@ fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological ut@@ op@@ ias of the nine@@ teenth and twen@@ tieth centuries , which were based on a belief in the inno@@ c@@ ence of the technologi@@ cally feasible and on the fact that , at the time , only a minority of people worldwide , largely in the west , benefited from technological progress .
by contrast , the twenty-@@ first century will be informed by the re@@ alization that the global eco@@ system and its resources , which are indispensable for human survival , are fin@@ ite , and that this implies an en@@ during responsibility to preserve what we have .
the energy future of nine billion people , which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century , lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy , but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency .
why , then , do the most advanced countries , in particular , take on the risk of a me@@ ga@@ -@@ catastro@@ phe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fis@@ sion ?
the answer , ultimately , doesn ’ t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy , but first and foremost with its military applications .
the energy derived from split@@ ting ur@@ anium and pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um at@@ oms was originally used for the ultimate weapon , the atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and pres@@ tige .
even today , the bom@@ b divi@@ des the world into two classes : the few states have it , and the many that do not .
the old cold war world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two super@@ powers , the united states and so@@ vi@@ et union .
to stop others from trying to become nuclear powers , which would have multip@@ lied and spread the risk of nuclear confron@@ tation , the non-@@ proliferation treaty ( n@@ pt ) was fra@@ med in the 1960 ’ s . to this day , it govern@@ s the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world , imposing ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation on the ha@@ ve-@@ no@@ ts and nu@@ clear@@ -@@ dis@@ armament obligations on the ha@@ ves .
of course , the n@@ pt has repeatedly been viol@@ ated or circum@@ v@@ ented by states that never subscri@@ bed to it .
to this day , therefore , the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase , particularly given small and medium powers ’ hope to enhance their pres@@ tige and position in regional conflicts .
ir@@ an is the most current example of this .
the nu@@ cle@@ ari@@ zation of these no@@ t-@@ al@@ wa@@ y@@ s-@@ stable states threat@@ ens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-@@ first century much more dangerous , and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists .
despite the n@@ pt , a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy h@@ as@@ n ’ t always worked , or worked completely , because the n@@ pt ’ s rules permit all signat@@ ory states to develop and use – under international supervision – all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes .
from here , then , all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders ’ decision to take them .
this political power , not the requirements of energy policy , is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult .
as a rule , the path to nu@@ clear@@ -@@ power status always begins with so-called “ civilian ” nuclear programs .
the supposed “ civilian ” nuclear ambitions of ir@@ an have thus , for instance , led to a large number of such “ civilian ” programs in neighbor@@ ing states .
h@@ onn@@ i so@@ it qui mal y pen@@ se !
and , of course , the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima will be wat@@ ched and analy@@ zed closely by the so-called “ c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine threshold countries . ”
so how will the world – first and foremost , the main nuclear powers – react to the fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima disaster ?
will the ti@@ de truly turn , prop@@ elling the world towards nuclear dis@@ armament and a future free of nuclear weapons ?
or will we witness attempts to down@@ play the cal@@ am@@ ity and return to business as usual as soon as possible ?
fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima has presented the world with a far-reaching , fundamental choice .
it was jap@@ an , the high-@@ tech country par excellence ( not the lat@@ ter-@@ day so@@ vi@@ et union ) that proved unable to take adequate precau@@ tions to aver@@ t disaster in four re@@ actor blocks .
what , then , will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nu@@ clear@@ -@@ energy capabilities ?
were they to abandon nuclear energy , however , their e@@ po@@ ch@@ al change of heart would constitute a semin@@ al contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation .
a bor@@ n-@@ again cap
wa@@ gen@@ ingen , ne@@ ther@@ lands – born in 1957 , the common agricultural policy ( cap ) is now more than 50 years old , and the europ@@ ean commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ aged child .
but super@@ ficial repa@@ irs will not meet the europ@@ ean union ’ s future needs .
the cap must be born again .
work on its renewal is due to start now , with the completed project ready in 2013 .
but a much more profound re-@@ think is needed .
the cap ’ s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the union , which were impor@@ ters of food and sought a degree of self-@@ suffici@@ ency .
good , healthy , and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens .
improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the union ’ s growing wealth .
instruments to achieve those objectives were developed , and food security was achieved .
the cap quickly came to be seen as the je@@ wel in the cro@@ wn of the europ@@ ean project .
as the eu has evol@@ ved and expanded , food systems have become more complex , involving production , processing , sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ chain organization , and wholesale and retail distribution , with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment .
the use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny .
a 1991 study by the ne@@ ther@@ lands scientific council for governmental policy , entitled ground for choices , demonstrated that the eu ’ s food supply could be met with 50 % less cultiv@@ ated land , 80 % less pesticides , and at 50 % less cost .
pollution would be reduced by 70 % as a result of fewer nit@@ rates in the surface water , and greenhouse gases would be cut .
those figures were for an eu of 15 countries , so with today ’ s 27 members the possibilities are even greater .
a dut@@ ch analysis of land use has shown that by emplo@@ ying the best technical and ecological means on the best available land , substantial gains could be made in food production .
so it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially .
viewed from the stand@@ point of food security and the wealth of rural areas , there is now an urgent need to re@@ visit the cap ’ s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced .
per@@ verse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favor@@ ing products such as bio-@@ fuels re@@ considered .
the status quo clearly has to be changed . rural policy in the eu is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community .
but that attitude is undermining change .
competition must be encouraged , as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community , with fewer farmers but better farms .
a simplified cap would encourage clean@@ er , more productive , and efficient agriculture .
a side benefit for the eu ’ s standing in the world could be that the world trade organization ’ s st@@ alled do@@ ha negotiations could be re@@ started once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from europ@@ e . moreover , the cap ’ s role as a motor of political and social integration in europ@@ e could be restored once renewed policies are in place .
but renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces , as the results might not necessarily benefit europ@@ ean agriculture and society .
if the market “ mis@@ beha@@ ves , ” farmers could be reduced to poverty , leading to the neg@@ le@@ ct of large areas of europ@@ e .
that is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the cap on the basis of the following five pillars .
1 . the eu needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens europ@@ ean agriculture ’ s competitiveness .
such a policy has been successful in the ne@@ ther@@ lands , substantially contributing to the development and power of the country ’ s agri@@ business .
ten of 21 branches of dut@@ ch agri@@ business , including hor@@ ti@@ cultural seeds , or@@ nament@@ als , seed pot@@ ato@@ es , and ve@@ al , are among the top contribut@@ ors to the national economy and the country ’ s trade balance .
in the eu as a whole , a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the europ@@ ean knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture ’ s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development .
2 . europ@@ e also needs a restructuring policy for land use .
many structural improvement programs have been financed at the europ@@ ean level , but agricultural production and land use are not among them .
the development of an agricultural main structure would compli@@ ment the europ@@ ean ecological main structure .
re@@ fore@@ station and the repair of natural eco@@ systems should also be part of a land use policy .
3 . a policy for europ@@ ean food systems would treat production , processing , distribution , logistics , and retail@@ ing in combination .
consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems .
preliminary studies by the europ@@ ean science foundation ’ s “ forward look on europ@@ ean food systems ” could prove useful in de@@ vising an eu@@ -@@ wide policy .
4 . metro@@ politan agriculture in a rapidly ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land .
it offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects .
5 . a new cap should include a policy to safeguard europ@@ e ’ s landscapes .
but a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere , nor should it ignore cost .
and it should not be a def@@ ensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on po@@ or-@@ quality land .
these five pillars involve dr@@ astic choices , but they will probably require less money from europ@@ e ’ s taxpayers , not more .
they could make a real contribution to clean@@ er , more productive , and efficient farming and land use , while addressing social needs .
a boy@@ co@@ tt against reason
“ it could happen here ” is the shor@@ th@@ and phrase frequently used for a variety of alarming hypo@@ theti@@ cal scenarios . “ how could this happen here ? ” was the question more per@@ tin@@ ently asked in great b@@ rit@@ ain recently , as its universities witnessed the un@@ fol@@ ding of an all-@@ to@@ o-@@ real and per@@ ple@@ x@@ ing action .
in early jun@@ e , the national association of teachers in further and higher education ( nat@@ f@@ he ) , b@@ rit@@ ain ’ s largest academic union , with 6@@ 7@@ ,000 members , passed a motion to se@@ ver ties with all isra@@ eli prof@@ essors and institutions of higher learning unless they publicly dis@@ soci@@ ate themselves from “ continuing isra@@ eli apar@@ thei@@ d policies . ”
the motion was subsequently re@@ vo@@ ked ; but the fact that it was put forward at all is aston@@ ishing enough .
indeed , the union ’ s call for a wholesale boy@@ co@@ tt contra@@ ven@@ ed its most fundamental values : the principle of academic freedom , openness , and exchange ; protection of research from state politics ; and the fundamental right to free speech .
the motion imp@@ lic@@ itly adopted the y@@ ard@@ stick of collective punishment and a distinc@@ tly m@@ cc@@ ar@@ th@@ y@@ ite tone , demanding a sort of “ dis@@ loy@@ alty o@@ ath ” from isra@@ eli academ@@ ics .
what led schol@@ ars who are put@@ atively the guar@@ di@@ ans of democratic freedoms to embra@@ ce measures so remin@@ is@@ cent of fasc@@ ist and stal@@ in@@ ist tac@@ tics ?
unfortunately , the nat@@ f@@ he effort is part of a larger phenomenon .
in 2005 , the association of university teachers ( aut ) called for a more limited boy@@ co@@ tt , sin@@ gling out bar il@@ an and ha@@ i@@ fa universities for op@@ pro@@ bri@@ um .
before that , a peti@@ tion , signed by roughly 80 prominent bri@@ tish intellec@@ tu@@ als and a few from other europ@@ ean countries , demanded the c@@ ess@@ ation of europ@@ ean union funding for isra@@ eli cultural projects and institutions .
these campaigns , encouraged by pal@@ est@@ inian groups and non-governmental organizations , have been accompanied by individual acts of professional o@@ stra@@ c@@ ism , and an informal boy@@ co@@ tt of isra@@ eli schol@@ ars , publications , and cultural projects already exists in some europ@@ ean cir@@ cles .
such developments suggest an advanced and deeply distur@@ bing trend , whereby certain segments of the europ@@ ean intelli@@ gent@@ sia are willing to viol@@ ate their own belie@@ fs in order to target one state for unique sti@@ g@@ mati@@ zation ; and whereby in@@ sidi@@ ous and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against that state ’ s citizens are increasingly seen as acceptable .
in a certain ideological min@@ d-@@ set , isra@@ el is perceived not as a political entity , sus@@ cep@@ tible to prev@@ ailing standards of judgment , but as an almost alleg@@ or@@ ical force , the symbolic center and source of the globe ’ s ev@@ ils and ail@@ ments .
of course , isra@@ el has been guilty of both bad policies and political sin@@ s .
the occupation of pal@@ est@@ inian territories has had terrible consequences , and it is necessary to end it .
but in today ’ s inten@@ sely charged climate , the middle east has become a kind of ideological pro@@ jection screen , a mag@@ net for tenden@@ cies to demon@@ ization and ide@@ alization .
in the put@@ atively “ radical ” interpretation , the relationship between isra@@ el and the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tra@@ gi@@ cally opposed interests .
rather , the stu@@ b@@ born comple@@ xi@@ ties of the situation are reduced to a stark struggle between absolute power and absolute power@@ less@@ ness , the arch@@ et@@ yp@@ al op@@ press@@ or and arch@@ et@@ yp@@ al op@@ pressed .
the rhetoric applied to isra@@ el becomes ever more extreme , and con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to hat@@ red .
phr@@ ases like “ apar@@ thei@@ d state ” and “ zion@@ ism is racism , ” un@@ thin@@ k@@ able in liberal dis@@ course a few years ago , have become routine .
at the same time , the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans become objects of roman@@ tici@@ zed identi@@ fications – one of the leaders of the n@@ af@@ the motion was seen , prior to a meeting , dra@@ ped in a pal@@ est@@ inian flag – and un@@ wit@@ ting con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion .
they are seen as the last pure cause , the entirely innocent “ other , ” un@@ imp@@ lic@@ ated in their fate and apparently deprived of political agency or choice .
the possibility that the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans are capable of deliber@@ ate decisions , that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation , or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence , is , in this framework , never admitted .
ham@@ as was never mentioned in either of the university unions ’ motions .
this is mani@@ che@@ anism of the left , and , like mani@@ che@@ anism of the political right , it can dist@@ ort reality to the point of becoming di@@ vor@@ ced from it .
certainly , the boy@@ co@@ tt efforts ignored basic facts .
advocates of discriminatory measures often charge their opponents with sti@@ fl@@ ing legitimate criticism of isra@@ el .
this argument is both dis@@ in@@ genu@@ ous and dis@@ honest .
many of the boy@@ cot@@ ts ’ critics are also critical of isra@@ el .
but credible criticism must be based on evidence – and on generally applicable criteria of judgment .
if the bri@@ tish unions wanted to be eth@@ ically consistent , they should apply the same strategies to universities in the numerous countries where human rights are brut@@ ally ab@@ used and free speech sup@@ pressed .
some see this ho@@ stil@@ ity to isra@@ el as cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ging ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned anti-@@ semi@@ tism .
it is always ris@@ ky to specul@@ ate about hidden mo@@ tives ; nevertheless , systematic dispar@@ agement of isra@@ eli society and culture undoubtedly encourages the sense that anti-@@ semi@@ tism , too , is a permitted prejudice .
it is always easier to see a group or nation as a mal@@ evol@@ ent “ other ” when this impul@@ se is fed by an old , and still po@@ tent , prejudice .
there is a deeper issue at stake .
democratic societies depend not only on the found@@ ational principle of free speech , but on the character of political thought and convers@@ ation among various constitu@@ encies .
when the sup@@ pose@@ dly most en@@ ligh@@ tened and liberal of those constitu@@ encies resorts to illi@@ ber@@ al dis@@ course and in@@ toler@@ ant measures , tenden@@ cies toward big@@ o@@ try and ideological ir@@ ration@@ ality are reinforced .
the actions of the bri@@ tish academic unions have isra@@ el as their obvious target .
but their main effect may be an ero@@ sion of reasoned debate and civil conduct , without which democracy is power@@ less against the forces of pol@@ ari@@ zation and extremis@@ m .
a break@@ through against hunger
new y@@ or@@ k – today ’ s world hunger crisis is un@@ prece@@ den@@ tedly severe and requires urgent measures .
nearly one billion people are tra@@ pped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago .
with sp@@ ain ’ s leadership and united nations secret@@ ary general ban ki@@ -@@ moon ’ s partnership , several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world ’ s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty tra@@ p .
the benefits of some donor help can be remarkable .
pe@@ as@@ ant farmers in afri@@ ca , ha@@ iti , and other im@@ pover@@ ished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-@@ yield seed varieties and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers .
the result is a grain yield ( for example , ma@@ ize ) that is roughly one-@@ third less than what could be achieved with better farm in@@ puts .
afri@@ can farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hec@@ t@@ are , compared with more than four tons per hec@@ t@@ are in ch@@ ina , where farmers use fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers heavily .
afri@@ can farmers know that they need fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er ; they just can ’ t afford it .
with donor help , they can .
not only do these farmers then feed their families , but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future .
by building up savings over a few years , the farmers eventually become credi@@ t@@ worthy , or have enough cash to purchase vit@@ ally necessary in@@ puts on their own .
there is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers ( those with two hectares or less of land , or im@@ pover@@ ished pa@@ stor@@ alists ) , which is especially urgent in afri@@ ca .
the un secret@@ ary general led a ste@@ ering group last year that determined that afri@@ can agriculture needs around $ 8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds , fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er , ir@@ rig@@ ation systems , and extension training .
in addition to direct help for small farms , donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-@@ yiel@@ ding seed varieties , especially to bre@@ ed plants that can with@@ stand temporary floo@@ ding , excess nit@@ ro@@ gen , sal@@ ty so@@ ils , crop p@@ ests , and other challenges to sustainable food production .
helping the poor with today ’ s technologies , while investing in future improved technologies , is the optimum division of labor .
this investment pays off wonder@@ fully , with research centers such as the international rice research institute and the international ma@@ ize and whe@@ at improvement centre providing the high-@@ yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the asi@@ an green revolution .
these centers are not household names , but they deserve to be .
their scientific break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s have helped to feed the world , and we ’ ll need more of them .
doz@@ ens of low-@@ income , foo@@ d-@@ deficit countries , perhaps as many as 4@@ 0-@@ 50 , have elabor@@ ated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms , but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding .
these countries have appe@@ aled to the world bank for financing , and the bank made a vali@@ ant effort in 2008 to help through its new global food crisis response program ( g@@ f@@ cr@@ p ) .
but the bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries ’ urgent needs , and has had to ration assistance to a small fra@@ ction of the flows that could be effectively and reli@@ ably used .
hundreds of millions of people , in the meantime , remain tra@@ pped in hunger .
many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for small@@ holder agriculture , but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so .
the current aid structures are inadequate .
the more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly frag@@ mented and of insufficient scale individually and collecti@@ vely .
despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals , the response to the hunger crisis remains utter@@ ly inadequate .
the 2008 plan@@ ting seas@@ ons came and went with much too little additional help for im@@ pover@@ ished small farmers .
afri@@ can countries search end@@ lessly , and mostly fruit@@ lessly , for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er and improved seeds .
my colleagues and i , serving on an advisory committee for the span@@ ish initiative , have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account , which we call the financial coordination mechanism ( f@@ cm ) .
these po@@ ol@@ ed funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er , improved seed varieties , and small-@@ scale ir@@ rig@@ ation equipment that they urgently need .
poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural in@@ puts from a single account , rather than from doz@@ ens of distinct and frag@@ mented donors .
by po@@ oling financial resources into a single-@@ donor f@@ cm , aid programs ’ administrative costs could be kept low , the availability of aid flows could be assured , and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help .
the time for business as usual is over .
the donors promised to double aid to afri@@ ca by 2010 , but are still far off track .
indeed , during the past 20 years , they actually cut aid for agriculture programs , and only now are revers@@ ing course .
mean@@ while , a billion people go hung@@ ry each day .
we need a break@@ through that is demon@@ stra@@ ble , public , clear , and convincing , that can mobili@@ ze the public ’ s hearts and minds , and that can demonstrate success .
history can be made in ma@@ dri@@ d at the end of jan@@ u@@ ary , when the world ’ s rich@@ est and poorest countries conver@@ ge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis .
the lives of the billion poorest people depend on it .
a break@@ through opportunity for global health
new y@@ or@@ k – every year , millions of people die from prev@@ ent@@ able and treat@@ able diseases , especially in poor countries .
in many cases , li@@ fes@@ aving medicines can be che@@ ap@@ ly mass@@ -@@ produced , but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them .
and many die simply because there are no cu@@ res or vacc@@ ines , because so little of the world ’ s valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor .
this state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected .
the good news is that there are now opportunities for change , most promis@@ ingly through an international effort headed by the world health organization that would begin to fix the broken intellec@@ tu@@ al-@@ property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs .
two main problems limit the availability of medicines today .
one is that they are very costly ; or , more accurately , the price charged for them is very high , though the cost of producing them is but a fra@@ ction of that amount .
second , drug development is geared toward maxim@@ izing profit , not social benefit , which sk@@ e@@ ws efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare .
because the poor have so little money to spend , drug companies , under current arrangements , have little incentive to do research on the diseases that aff@@ lic@@ t them .
drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development .
but , in the united states , it is actually the government that finances most heal@@ th-@@ related research and development – directly , through public support ( national institutes of health , national science foundation ) , and indirectly , through public purchases of medicine , both in the medi@@ care and medic@@ aid programs .
even the part that is not govern@@ ment-@@ financed is not a conventional market ; most individuals ’ purchases of pres@@ cription medicines are covered by insurance .
efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available .
th@@ om@@ as je@@ ffer@@ son compared knowledge to c@@ and@@ les : when one is used to light another , it does not dimin@@ ish the light of the first .
on the contrary , everything becomes bri@@ ghter .
yet , in ameri@@ ca and most of the world , drug prices are still ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant and the spread of knowledge is tigh@@ tly limited .
that is because we have created a patent system that gives innov@@ ators a temporary monopoly over what they create , which encourages them to ho@@ ard their knowledge , l@@ est they help a competi@@ tor .
while this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable , it allows drug companies to drive up prices , and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns .
in the heal@@ th-@@ care sector , it may be more profitable to devote research to a “ me@@ -@@ too ” drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference .
the patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation , because , while the most important input into any research is prior ideas , the patent system encourages sec@@ rec@@ y .
a solution to both high prices and mis@@ directed research is to replace the current model with a govern@@ ment-@@ supported prize fund .
with a prize system , innov@@ ators are rewar@@ ded for new knowledge , but they do not retain a monopoly on its use .
that way , the power of competitive markets can ensure that , once a drug is developed , it is made available at the lowest possible price – not at an infl@@ ated monopoly price .
fortunately , some us law@@ makers are taking a strong interest in this approach .
the prize fund for hi@@ v / aids act , a con@@ gres@@ sional bill introduced by sen@@ ator ber@@ nie s@@ anders , is just such an initiative .
his bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-@@ source research , which would move the current research model away from sec@@ rec@@ y toward sharing .
but , globally , our innovation system needs much bigger changes .
the who ’ s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial .
this spring , the who released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the us sen@@ ate bill , but on a global level .
importantly , the report , “ research and development to meet health needs in developing countries , ” recommends a comprehensive approach , including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries ’ health needs ; international coordination of heal@@ th-@@ care priorities and implementation ; and a global ob@@ servatory that would monitor where needs are greatest .
in late may , the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the who world health assembly – a moment of hope for public health around the world .
reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics . it is , in many cases , a matter of life and death .
it is therefore essential to de-@@ link r &@@ amp@@ ; d incentives from drug prices , and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge .
for ameri@@ ca , the s@@ anders bill marks important progress .
for the world , the who ’ s recommendations represent a on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ generation opportunity to remedy a long-@@ standing and eg@@ regi@@ ous in@@ equity in health care , and , more broadly , to set a model for governance of global public goods be@@ fitting an era of globalization .
we cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by .
ab@@ sent@@ -@@ minded k@@ ill@@ ers
as a species , human beings have a major self-@@ control problem .
we humans are now so aggres@@ sively fishing , hunting , log@@ ging , and growing crops in all parts of the world that we are literally ch@@ asing other species off the planet .
our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life .
in 1992 , when the world ’ s governments first promised to address man@@ -@@ made global warming , they also vo@@ wed to head off the hum@@ an-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed ext@@ inc@@ tion of other species .
the convention on biological diversity , agreed at the ri@@ o earth summit , established that “ biological diversity is a common concern of humanity . ” the signat@@ ories agreed to con@@ serve biological diversity , by saving species and their habit@@ ats , and to use biological resources ( e.g. , forests ) in a sustainable manner .
in 2002 , the treaty ’ s signat@@ ories went further , commit@@ ting to “ a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss ” by 2010 .
unfortunately , like so many other international agreements , the convention on biological diversity remains essentially unknown , un@@ -@@ champi@@ oned , and un@@ fulfilled .
that neg@@ le@@ ct is a human tragedy .
for a very low cash out@@ lay – and perhaps none at all on balance – we could con@@ serve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and live@@ li@@ hoods .
we kill other species not because we must , but because we are too negli@@ gent to do otherwise .
consider a couple of not@@ orious examples .
some rich countries , such as sp@@ ain , portu@@ gal , au@@ str@@ alia , and new ze@@ aland , have fishing fleets that engage in so-called “ bottom tra@@ w@@ ling . ”
bottom tra@@ w@@ lers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom , destroying magnificent , un@@ explo@@ red , and endanger@@ ed marine species in the process .
complex and unique ec@@ ologies , most notably underground volcan@@ oes known as se@@ amounts , are ri@@ pped to sh@@ reds , because bottom tra@@ w@@ ling is the “ low cost ” way to catch a few deep sea fish species .
one of these species , orange rou@@ gh@@ y , has been caught commer@@ cially for only around a quar@@ ter-@@ century , but already is being f@@ ished to the point of collapse .
likewise , in many parts of the world , tropical rain@@ forest is being cleared for past@@ ure land and food crops .
the result is massive loss of habit@@ at and destruction of species , yiel@@ ding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost .
after cutting down a sw@@ ath of rain@@ forest , so@@ ils are often quickly le@@ ached of their nutri@@ ents so that they cannot sustain crops or nutri@@ tious gr@@ asses for livestock .
as a result , the new past@@ ure land or farm@@ land is soon abandoned , with no prospect for re@@ generation of the original forest and its unique eco@@ systems .
because these activities ’ costs are so high and their benefits so low , st@@ opping them would be easy .
bottom tra@@ w@@ ling should simply be out@@ la@@ wed ; it would be simple and in@@ expensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities .
forest clearing , on the other hand , is probably best stopped by economic incentives , perhaps combined with regulatory limits .
simply restric@@ ting the practice of land clearing probably would not work , since farm families and communities would face a strong temp@@ tation to ev@@ ade legal limits .
on the other hand , financial incentives would probably succeed , because cutting down forest to create pa@@ stu@@ reland is not profitable enough to in@@ duce farmers to fo@@ reg@@ o payments for protecting the land .
many rain@@ forest countries have united in recent years to suggest the establishment of a rain@@ forest conservation fund by the rich countries , to pay im@@ pover@@ ished small farmers a small amount of money to preserve the forest .
a well-@@ designed fund would slow or stop de@@ fore@@ station , preserve biodiversity , and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the burning of cleared forests .
at the same time , small farmers would receive a steady flow of income , which they could use for micro-@@ investments to improve their household ’ s wealth , education , and health .
aside from bann@@ ing bottom tra@@ w@@ ling and establishing a global fund for avoided de@@ fore@@ station , we should design@@ ate a global network of protected marine areas , in which fishing , bo@@ ating , poll@@ uting , dre@@ dging , dri@@ ll@@ ing , and other damaging activities would be prohibited .
such areas not only permit the re@@ generation of species , but also provide ecological benefits that sp@@ ill over to neighbor@@ ing un@@ protected areas .
we also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abund@@ ance and ext@@ inc@@ tion , just as we now have such a process for climate change .
politicians don ’ t listen very well to individual scientists , but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice .
finally , the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow hum@@ an-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed climate change .
there can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species ’ viability .
as the planet war@@ ms , and rain and storm patterns change dramatically , many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival .
some can mig@@ rate , but others ( such as pol@@ ar bears ) are likely to be driven to ext@@ inc@@ tion unless we take decisive action to head off climate change .
these measures are achie@@ vable by 2010 .
they are affordable , and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits .
most importantly , they would allow us to follow through on a global promise .
it is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species – and jeop@@ ardi@@ ze our own future – in a fit of ab@@ sent@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ dness .
the closing of the academic mind
lon@@ don – i would w@@ ager that i have been chan@@ cell@@ or of more universities than anyone alive today .
this is partly because when i was govern@@ or of h@@ ong kon@@ g , i was made chan@@ cell@@ or of every university in the city .
i pro@@ tested that it would surely be better for the universities to choose their own constitutional heads . but the universities would not allow me to re@@ sign gra@@ ce@@ fully .
so for five years i enjoyed the experience of giving tens of thousands of students their degrees and watching what this rit@@ e of passage meant for them and their families .
when i came back to b@@ rit@@ ain in 1997 , i was asked to become chan@@ cell@@ or of new@@ castle university .
then , in 2003 , i was elected chan@@ cell@@ or by the gradu@@ ates of ox@@ ford university , one of the world ’ s greatest institutions of learning .
so it should not be surprising that i have strong views about what it means to be a university and to teach , do research , or study at one .
universities should be bas@@ tions of freedom in any society .
they should be free from government interference in their primary purposes of research and teaching ; and they should control their own academic governance .
i do not believe it is possible for a university to become or remain a world-@@ class institution if these conditions do not exist .
the role of a university is to promote the clas@@ h of ideas , to test the results of research with other schol@@ ars , and to im@@ part new knowledge to students .
freedom of speech is thus fundamental to what universities are , enabling them to sustain a sense of common humanity and uphold the mutual tolerance and understanding that underp@@ in any free society .
that , of course , makes universities dangerous to author@@ itarian governments , which seek to sti@@ f@@ le the ability to raise and attempt to answer difficult questions .
but if any den@@ ial of academic liberty is a b@@ low struck against the meaning of a university , the ir@@ ony today is that some of the most worrying attacks on these values have been coming from inside universities .
in the united states and the united king@@ dom , some students and teachers now seek to constra@@ in argument and debate .
they conten@@ d that people should not be exposed to ideas with which they strongly disagree .
moreover , they argue that history should be re@@ written to exp@@ unge the names ( though not the en@@ dow@@ ments ) of those who fail to pass today ’ s tests of political correc@@ tness .
th@@ om@@ as je@@ ffer@@ son and c@@ ec@@ il r@@ ho@@ des , among others , have been targeted .
and how would chur@@ chill and wash@@ ington fare if the same tests were applied to them ?
some people are being denied the chance to speak as well – so-called “ no plat@@ forming ” , in the aw@@ ful jar@@ gon of some clearly not very liter@@ ate camp@@ uses .
there are calls for “ safe spaces ” where students can be protected from anything that ass@@ aults their sense of what is moral and appropriate .
this reflects and inevitably nur@@ tures a harmful politics of vic@@ tim@@ ization – defining one ’ s own identity ( and thus one ’ s interests ) in opposition to others .
when i was a student 50 years ago , my principal teacher was a leading mar@@ x@@ ist hist@@ orian and former member of the communist party . the bri@@ tish security services were deeply suspici@@ ous of him .
he was a great hist@@ orian and teacher , but these days i might be encouraged to think that he had threatened my “ safe space . ”
in fact , he made me a great deal better informed , more open to discussion of ideas that challeng@@ ed my own , more capable of distingu@@ ishing between an argument and a quar@@ rel , and more prepared to think for myself .
of course , some ideas – inc@@ itement of ra@@ cial hat@@ red , gender ho@@ stil@@ ity , or political violence – are an@@ a@@ thema in every free society .
liberty requires some limits ( decided freely by democratic argument under the rule of law ) in order to exist .
universities should be tru@@ sted to exercise that degree of control themselves .
but in@@ tolerance of debate , of discussion , and of particular branches of schol@@ ar@@ ship should never be toler@@ ated .
as the great political phil@@ osop@@ her kar@@ l po@@ pper taught us , the only thing we should be in@@ toler@@ ant of is in@@ tolerance itself .
that is especially true at universities .
yet some ameri@@ can and bri@@ tish academ@@ ics and students are themselves undermining freedom ; parado@@ x@@ ically , they have the liberty to do so .
mean@@ while , universities in ch@@ ina and h@@ ong kon@@ g are faced with threats to their autonomy and freedom , not from within , but from an author@@ itarian government .
in h@@ ong kon@@ g , the autonomy of universities and free speech itself , guaranteed in the city ’ s basic law and the 5@@ 0-@@ year treaty between b@@ rit@@ ain and ch@@ ina on the city ’ s status , are under threat .
the r@@ ationale seems to be that , because students strongly supported the pro-@@ democracy protests in 2014 , the universities where they study should be brought to he@@ el .
so the city ’ s government bl@@ under@@ s away , stir@@ ring up trouble , clearly on the orders of the government in bei@@ jing .
indeed , the chin@@ ese authorities only recently showed what they think of treaty obligations and of the “ golden age ” of sin@@ o-@@ bri@@ tish relations ( much adverti@@ sed by bri@@ tish ministers ) , by ab@@ duc@@ ting a bri@@ tish citizen ( and four other h@@ ong kon@@ g residents ) on the city ’ s streets .
the five were publishing books that exposed some of the dirty secre@@ ts of ch@@ ina ’ s leaders .
on the main@@ land , the chin@@ ese communist party has launched the biggest cra@@ ck@@ down on universities since the after@@ math of the k@@ ill@@ ings in ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square in 1989 .
there is to be no discussion of so-called western values in ch@@ ina ’ s universities .
only mar@@ x@@ ism can be taught .
did no one tell president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping and his pol@@ it@@ bur@@ o colleagues where kar@@ l mar@@ x came from ?
the trouble these days is precisely that they know little about mar@@ x but a lot about len@@ in .
west@@ ern@@ ers should take a closer interest in what is happening in ch@@ ina ’ s universities and what that tells us about the real values underp@@ inning schol@@ ar@@ ship , teaching , and the ac@@ ade@@ my .
compare and contrast , as students are asked to do .
do you want universities where the government decides what it is alle@@ ge@@ dly safe for you to learn and discuss ?
or do you want universities that regard the idea of a “ safe space ” – in terms of closing down debate in case it off@@ ends someone – as an ox@@ y@@ mor@@ on in an academic setting ?
western students should think occasionally about their counterparts in h@@ ong kon@@ g and ch@@ ina who must fight for freedoms that they take for granted – and too often abuse .
the new brain dra@@ in in science
du@@ bai – in dec@@ ember 2013 , the no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate physi@@ c@@ ist p@@ eter hig@@ gs told the guar@@ dian that if he were seeking a job in ac@@ ade@@ mia today , “ i don ’ t think i would be regarded as productive enough . ”
having published fewer than ten papers since his ground@@ breaking work in 1964 , hig@@ gs believes that no university would employ him nowadays .
academ@@ ics are well acqu@@ ain@@ ted with the notion of “ publish or per@@ ish . ”
they must publish their work in pe@@ er-@@ reviewed journ@@ als increasingly often to clim@@ b the career lad@@ der , protect their jobs , and secure funding for their institutions .
but what happens to scientists and other schol@@ ars , such as those in the middle east , who have different research concerns from – and sc@@ ant connections to – the professional journ@@ als that can make or break an academic / scientific career ?
schol@@ ars and institutions with high publishing rates in the established journ@@ als receive better productivity sco@@ res , which translate into bigger re@@ wards , in terms of enhanced care@@ ers and greater research funding .
whether the work they are publishing has a meas@@ ur@@ able impact on their field of study is , sad@@ ly , too often a secondary concern .
the incentives they face mean that quantity often comes before quality .
academic journ@@ als determine the various disciplinary rank@@ ings that academic institutions are comp@@ elled to clim@@ b , which leads institutions to hire and retain only those schol@@ ars who can produce at high rates .
this has given rise to a deeper , two@@ fold problem : academic journ@@ als have become dis@@ proportion@@ ately influ@@ ential , and they have placed a premium on emp@@ i@@ rical research .
with respect to the first problem , journ@@ als are gradually replacing institutions as the arbit@@ ers of quality within academic communities .
schol@@ ars in almost any discipline seeking jobs at “ a-@@ level ” institutions must publish in a select few a-@@ level journ@@ als that are seen as g@@ ate@@ ways .
these journ@@ als ’ edi@@ torial boards increasingly privi@@ lege posi@@ tiv@@ ist theoretical work – meaning research that is based on emp@@ i@@ rical data analysis .
qualitative research – such as eth@@ no@@ grap@@ hi@@ es , particip@@ atory surveys , and case studies – is often designated as suitable only for b@@ - and c-@@ level journ@@ als .
academ@@ ics conducting emp@@ i@@ rical research have a big advantage over those carrying out qualitative work , because they can use efficient software and powerful computers to test their hypo@@ thes@@ es quickly and account for different variables in data sets .
this kind of work can be cheaper , too , because a single data set can generate multiple journ@@ al articles .
to be sure , there is nothing wrong with scientific practices evol@@ ving along with technology , or with academ@@ ics using ri@@ cher data sets and better software .
but adoption of this quantitative approach should not be the single most important criterion for assessing scientific excellence and deciding career tra@@ jec@@ tories .
after all , knowledge is acquired in different ways , and emp@@ i@@ rical posi@@ tivis@@ m is only one method in a larger ep@@ is@@ tem@@ ological inventory .
the posi@@ tiv@@ ist trend in science today is particularly problematic for developing countries , where data sets are scar@@ ce and often of poor quality .
thus , scientists working in developing countries face a di@@ lemma : either work on rich@@ -@@ world problems for which there is abund@@ ant data , or risk career adv@@ ancement by conducting qualitative work that will not make it into a-@@ level journ@@ als .
academ@@ ics who move from dat@@ a-@@ rich countries in europ@@ e and north ameri@@ ca to dat@@ a-@@ poor countries in the middle east and elsewhere often face this problem .
as researchers at my institution in ab@@ u d@@ hab@@ i know , conducting surveys for qualitative research is feasible ; but generating rich data from scrat@@ ch for the@@ or@@ y-@@ building research is extremely difficult .
at the international conference on science and technology indicators this year , a f@@ ren@@ ch academic resear@@ ching soil in afri@@ ca reported that only 5 % of the published work in his field has origin@@ ated from afri@@ can researchers .
when he du@@ g deeper into his own research , he found that 50 % of what he had learned about afri@@ can soil came from afri@@ can researchers , who have not or could not publish their work in international academic journ@@ als .
countries where english is not the ling@@ ua fran@@ ca are particularly disadvantaged in science , not because they lack academic excellence , but because engl@@ ish-@@ language journ@@ als call the shots .
non-@@ english academic journ@@ als simply do not command the same attention in the science community .
as a result , the scope of research topics that many countries can undertake is limited , and they must struggle to retain scientific talent .
this is particularly true in the middle east , where governments are strug@@ gling to diversi@@ fy their economies , in order to make them more re@@ sili@@ ent .
as engl@@ ish-@@ language emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cal@@ -@@ research journ@@ als consolidate their hold on the channels that determine whether or not a scienti@@ st will have a successful career , developing countries will have to invest heavily in their own data infrastructure to place domestic researchers on a more competitive footing .
but even – or especially – if developing countries do make such investments , much will be lost to science .
with ( mostly ) united stat@@ es-@@ based academic journ@@ als re@@ ign@@ ing over global science , no one has to move to become part of a new brain dra@@ in , whereby scientists ’ research priorities , problems , and methods gra@@ vit@@ ate to the dominant posi@@ tiv@@ ist ep@@ is@@ tem@@ ology , at the expense of all alternatives .
kamp@@ ala – last month , the united king@@ dom hosted the first-@@ ever global disability summit to help focus the world ’ s attention on the needs of people with disabilities .
the agenda was packed with topics like building equ@@ itable education , ending discrimination , and bringing technology to disabled communities – especially poor countries in the global south .
but one challenge that did not receive the attention it deser@@ ved is an o@@ f@@ ten-@@ over@@ looked component of development policy : access to financial services .
this was a missed opportunity – not only for the world ’ s one billion disabled people , but also for the institutions that should be serving them .
increasing the accessibility of financial services is good for business and economic growth .
according to research by bar@@ cla@@ ys , when customers with disabilities are able to manage their money , economic vulnerability dec@@ lines and overall economic health improves .
moreover , with more than $ 1 tril@@ lion in dis@@ pos@@ able income , the so-called disability market is among the biggest potential client bases in the world .
in other words , finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ service providers have every reason to c@@ ater to people with disabilities .
why , then , are most businesses doing just the opposite ?
one reason is a lack of awareness .
because people with disabilities typically have less income than their non@@ disabled pe@@ ers , service providers have often l@@ acked an incentive to extend support to them .
but , with more attention being paid to total market potential , financial institutions are starting to adjust their product lines accordingly .
as they do , four issues must be addressed to maxim@@ ize the benefits for customers with accessibility challenges .
first , finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ services companies must work harder to understand the needs of current and future clients .
for example , with better data , a bank in a particular market could improve the accessibility of its mobi@@ le-@@ banking platforms .
this is essentially what happened at standard char@@ tered bank in indi@@ a last year , when employees developed a voic@@ e-@@ assisted system to help vis@@ ually im@@ pa@@ ired customers access their accounts online .
good data are also essential to the effectiveness of advoc@@ acy groups as they push providers to improve their services .
second , engagement must not stop with innovative products ; it must also be extended to the labor market .
simply put , the finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ services industry should hire more people with disabilities by investing in ass@@ is@@ tive technologies like bra@@ ille readers and alternative and aug@@ ment@@ ative communication devices .
the need to diversi@@ fy the workforce is particularly acute in the united states , where one in five people has a disability .
third , people with disabilities must always be included in discussions about how to expand and strengthen financial independence .
in 2013 , when the l@@ loy@@ ds banking group conven@@ ed a focus group to examine the effects of de@@ men@@ tia on customer behavior , engagement with clients led to the charter on de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ friendly financial services .
this innovative document codi@@ fied how banks should tail@@ or products to clients with co@@ gni@@ tive im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ments .
future initiatives should follow this collabor@@ ative model to ensure that decision-making at all levels is facilit@@ ated by hum@@ an-@@ c@@ entered design .
and , la@@ stly , governments must commit to addressing this issue , by em@@ ul@@ ating the action of countries like the uk , which has linked services for the disabled to development funding .
with the right support , progress on these complex challenges can be swe@@ eping ; for example , at financial sector deepening ug@@ anda , where i work , we are using bri@@ tish aid money to extend financial services to the disabled in rural communities .
our vision is to encourage the emergence of similar programs in many other countries around the world .
with 91 countries having already ratified the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities , it is clear that there is plenty of political support for these initiatives .
the challenge now is to turn ple@@ dges into action .
in the coming decades , the world ’ s disabled population will grow as medical advances allow people to live longer , health@@ ier , ful@@ ler lives .
providing the disabled with access to financial services and products is among the best ways to guard against discrimination and nur@@ ture long-term em@@ power@@ ment .
full financial inclusion will come slowly for a community often referred to as the “ fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing minority group in the world . ”
the task for activists , advocates , en@@ ligh@@ tened business leaders , and policymakers is to highlight the social and economic benefits of success .
surgery for all
bo@@ ston – on a recent trip to indi@@ a , i ha@@ iled a ri@@ ck@@ sha@@ w that was pe@@ dal@@ ed , i soon noticed , by a man with a l@@ ame leg .
it turns out that a few weeks earlier , the driver had been hit by a car while navig@@ ating the busy streets of new del@@ hi .
although he had managed to obtain medic@@ ation from a local pharm@@ acy for the agon@@ izing pain – probably because his leg was broken – he could spare neither the time nor the money to see a sur@@ ge@@ on .
this type of tragic calcul@@ us is stri@@ k@@ ingly common .
the lan@@ c@@ et commission on global surgery estimates that some five billion people – almost 70 % of the world ’ s population – lack access to safe , affordable sur@@ gical and an@@ es@@ thetic care , while 33 million people are s@@ add@@ led with unbe@@ ar@@ ably high health expenses .
not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , the global poor suffer dis@@ proportion@@ ately : while low-@@ income countries are home to close to 35 % of humanity , they account for just 3.5 % of all sur@@ gical procedures .
one of the biggest obstacles to achieving universal health coverage – which the united nations has declared a global goal – is financing .
and , parado@@ x@@ ical as it may sound , one of the best ways that governments can get the money they need to expand coverage is by making surgery more widely available .
time-@@ sensitive health problems – such as in@@ juries from traffic accidents and pregn@@ anc@@ y-@@ related comp@@ lications – are among the leading causes of death and disability in low@@ - and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries .
but un@@ treated or under@@ treated conditions requiring surgery also h@@ urt economic productivity .
for example , the lan@@ c@@ et study estimated that the failure to improve sur@@ gical care in developing countries would translate into $ 12.@@ 3 tril@@ lion of lost economic output by 2030 .
failure to maintain strong sur@@ gical capacity could even under@@ cut economic gains made by mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries , reducing total g@@ d@@ p growth by approximately 2 % annually .
for many leaders , the common perception is that provision of sur@@ gical care is not sustainable or cost-effective .
when faced with tough budget choices , governments often favor programs that combat infec@@ tious and chronic diseases , leaving people like my ri@@ ck@@ sha@@ w driver in the l@@ urch .
but a growing body of evidence suggests that these views are mis@@ placed .
when researchers at the har@@ v@@ ard medical school analy@@ zed sur@@ gical interventions in low@@ - and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries , they found a remarkable dis@@ connect between economic assu@@ mp@@ tions and reality .
for example , they calculated that money spent on ces@@ are@@ an sections and joint sur@@ geri@@ es yiel@@ ds higher returns than spending on the management of hi@@ v or heart disease .
to be sure , chronic and infec@@ tious diseases need our attention , too ; we cannot re@@ structure health systems overnight , nor should we turn our backs on those being treated for non-@@ sur@@ gical ill@@ nesses .
but reforms that focus more attention on the importance of surgery would boost economic productivity and help create more equ@@ itable health care for everyone .
for star@@ ters , health min@@ istri@@ es and physi@@ cian organizations should formally recognize that sur@@ gical and an@@ es@@ thetic care are an essential part of universal health coverage .
to make this case , heal@@ th-@@ care providers will need to improve their collection and analysis of data on sur@@ gical outcomes , which would increase transparency on mortality and mor@@ bi@@ dity and strengthen overall accountability .
decisions about how to expand services could be guided by the lan@@ c@@ et commission ’ s core indicators on “ prep@@ are@@ dness , ” “ delivery , ” and “ impact ” of sur@@ gical care .
second , to pool risk and guard against cost over@@ runs , countries that are considering universal coverage policies should put sur@@ gical care under publicly financed plans .
while some funding for expanding sur@@ gical services could come from taxation , heal@@ th-@@ care providers should also explore innovative financing options – such as “ social justice models , ” whereby people pay according to their means .
finally , to stream@@ line resources and increase sur@@ gical capacity , hospitals should explore t@@ as@@ k-@@ sharing , whereby non-@@ emergency cases are referred to licensed nur@@ ses and physi@@ cian assist@@ ants .
lon@@ ger-@@ term strategies include investing more in medical education to bol@@ ster the ranks of doctors and sur@@ ge@@ ons .
the tremendous economic progress that many developing countries have made in recent decades has been largely driven by vibrant , young , and ambitious populations .
one of the most effective ways to maintain this growth and development is to ensure access to safe and affordable healthcare – including surgery .
while the cost of providing it may be high , the cost of not providing it is even higher .
pollu@@ ters must pay
new y@@ or@@ k – when b@@ p and its dri@@ ll@@ ing partners caused the deep@@ water horiz@@ on oil sp@@ ill in the g@@ ulf of m@@ ex@@ ico in 2010 , the united states government demanded that b@@ p finance the clean@@ up , compensate those who suffered damages , and pay criminal penalties for the violations that led to the disaster .
b@@ p has already committed more than $ 20 billion in re@@ mediation and penalties .
based on a settlement last week , b@@ p will now pay the largest criminal penalty in us history – $ 4.@@ 5 billion .
the same standards for environmental clean@@ up need to be applied to global companies operating in poorer countries , where their power has typically been so great relative to that of governments that many act with imp@@ unity , w@@ re@@ aking ha@@ vo@@ c on the environment with little or no accountability .
as we enter a new era of sustainable development , imp@@ unity must turn to responsibility .
pollu@@ ters must pay , whether in rich or poor countries .
major companies need to accept responsibility for their actions .
ni@@ geri@@ a has been ex@@ hibit a of corporate environmental imp@@ unity .
for decades , major oil companies , including shell , ex@@ x@@ on@@ mobi@@ l , and ch@@ ev@@ ron , have been producing oil in the ni@@ ger del@@ ta , an ec@@ ologically fragile environment of fresh@@ water sw@@ amp forests , man@@ gro@@ ves , low@@ land rain@@ forests , and coastal barrier islands .
this rich habit@@ at supports remarkable biodiversity – or did before the oil companies got there – and more than 30 million local inhabitants , who depend on the local eco@@ systems for their health and live@@ li@@ hoods .
twenty years ago , the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources classified the ni@@ ger del@@ ta as a region of high biodiversity of marine and coastal flora and fauna – tree species , fish , birds , and m@@ am@@ mals , among other forms of life – and therefore rated it as a very high priority for conservation .
yet it also noted that the region ’ s biodiversity was under massive threat , with little or no protection .
the global companies operating in the del@@ ta have sp@@ illed oil and fla@@ red natural gas for decades , without regard for the natural environment and the communities im@@ pover@@ ished and po@@ is@@ oned by their actions .
one estimate puts the cum@@ ul@@ ative sp@@ ills over the past 50 years at approximately 10 million bar@@ rel@@ s – twice the size of the b@@ p sp@@ ill .
the data are uncertain : there have been many thousands of sp@@ ills during this period – often po@@ or@@ ly documented and their mag@@ nit@@ ude hidden or simply un@@ measured by either the companies or the government .
indeed , just as b@@ p was being hit with new criminal penalties , ex@@ x@@ on@@ mobi@@ l announced yet another pipeline lea@@ k in the ni@@ ger del@@ ta .
the environmental destruction of the del@@ ta is part of a larger sag@@ a : cor@@ rupt companies operating hand in hand with cor@@ rupt government officials .
the companies rout@@ inely bri@@ be officials to gain oil le@@ ases , lie about output , ev@@ ade taxes , and do@@ dge responsibility for the environmental damage that they cause .
ni@@ geri@@ an officials have become f@@ abul@@ ously weal@@ thy , owing to decades of pay@@ off@@ s by international companies that have pl@@ under@@ ed the del@@ ta ’ s natural wealth .
shell , the largest foreign operator in the ni@@ ger del@@ ta , has been cri@@ tici@@ zed repeatedly for its eg@@ regi@@ ous practices and its un@@ willingness to be held to account .
mean@@ while , the local population has remained im@@ pover@@ ished and bes@@ et by diseases caused by un@@ safe air , po@@ is@@ oned drinking water , and pollution in the food chain .
local law@@ less@@ ness has led to gang war@@ fare and persistent illegal ta@@ pping into the pi@@ pel@@ ines to ste@@ al oil , leading to further massive oil sp@@ ills and frequent explo@@ sions that kill doz@@ ens , including innocent b@@ yst@@ anders .
in the colonial era , it was the official purpose of imperi@@ al power to extrac@@ t wealth from the administer@@ ed territories .
in the post-@@ colonial period , the methods are better dis@@ gu@@ ised .
when oil companies mis@@ be@@ have in ni@@ geri@@ a or elsewhere , they are protected by the power of their home countries .
don ’ t m@@ ess with the companies , they are told by the united states and europ@@ e .
indeed , one of the largest bri@@ bes ( a rep@@ uted $ 180 million ) paid in recent times in ni@@ geri@@ a was by hal@@ li@@ bur@@ ton , a company tigh@@ tly inter@@ tw@@ ined with us political power .
( di@@ ck chen@@ ey went from being hal@@ li@@ bur@@ ton ’ s ce@@ o to the us vice presidency . )
last year , the united nations environment program ( un@@ ep ) issued a remarkable report on og@@ on@@ il@@ and , a major ethnic hom@@ eland in the ni@@ ger del@@ ta that has been at the ep@@ ic@@ enter of conflict between local communities and international oil .
the report was as sc@@ a@@ thing as it was scienti@@ fically clear .
despite many past promises of a clean@@ up , og@@ on@@ il@@ and remains in environmental ag@@ ony , im@@ pover@@ ished and si@@ ck@@ ened by the oil industry .
un@@ ep also offered clear and detailed recommendations , including emergency measures to ensure safe drinking water ; clean@@ up activities targeting the man@@ gro@@ ves and so@@ ils ; public-@@ health studies to identify and counter@@ act the consequences of pollution ; and a new regulatory framework .
the world ’ s governments have recently agreed to move to a new framework for sustainable development , declar@@ ing their intention to adopt sustainable development goals at the ri@@ o + 20 summit in jun@@ e .
the s@@ d@@ gs offer a critical opportunity for the world to set clear , comp@@ elling standards for government and corporate behavior .
many major companies , including in the oil industry , have expressed their readiness to support sustainable development goals .
cleaning up the ni@@ ger del@@ ta would provide the strongest possible example of a new age of accountability .
shell , ch@@ ev@@ ron , ex@@ x@@ on@@ mobi@@ l , and other major oil companies should step forward and help to fund the necessary clean@@ up , us@@ her@@ ing in a new era of responsibility .
the ni@@ geri@@ an government ’ s own accountability is on the line as well .
it is hear@@ tening that several ni@@ geri@@ an sen@@ ators have recently been in the fore@@ front of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector .
the clean@@ up of the ni@@ ger del@@ ta provides an ideal opportunity for ni@@ geri@@ a , the oil industry , and the international community to show convinc@@ ingly that a new age has da@@ wn@@ ed .
from now on , sustainable development must not be a mere s@@ log@@ an , but rather an operational approach to global governance and well-being on a stra@@ ined and crow@@ ded planet .
accounting for ga@@ za
new y@@ or@@ k – this week the united nations human rights council will debate the report of the fac@@ t-@@ finding mission led by judge rich@@ ard gol@@ d@@ stone on human rights violations in the ga@@ za conflict .
let us hope it is a full and fair examination based on the report ’ s findings and recommendations .
unfortunately , rather than debating gol@@ d@@ stone ’ s detailed findings and the merits of his recommendations on ways to move forward , there are indications that governments may focus instead on the process leading up to the investigation and seek to limit full discussion of the report .
as someone involved in that process , i feel it is important to put my views on record , as comments i made previously are now being used as part of the effort to undermine judge gol@@ d@@ stone and his important work .
i refused to accept the invitation from the president of the human rights council at the time , am@@ bassador mar@@ tin u@@ homo@@ i@@ b@@ hi of ni@@ geri@@ a , to lead the investigation following the human rights council ’ s jan@@ u@@ ary 12 , 2009 resolution . as a former un high commission@@ er for human rights , i felt strongly that the council ’ s resolution was one-@@ si@@ ded and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground .
it referred only to “ the grave violations of human rights in the occupied pal@@ est@@ inian territory , particularly due to the recent isra@@ eli military attacks , ” and called for a mission to investigate “ all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occup@@ ying power , isra@@ el , against the pal@@ est@@ inian people . ”
i was also aware that the un human rights council had made repeated condem@@ nations of isra@@ el over the past two years but had focused little attention on large-scale violations of human rights in other countries .
this pattern of action and in@@ action by the council has given greater cre@@ dence to those who believe the un ’ s highest human rights body is inher@@ ently anti-@@ isra@@ el .
i decided i could not undertake the mission for these reasons .
i am aware that judge gol@@ d@@ stone , a dedicated and un@@ impe@@ ach@@ able human rights lawyer and advocate , shared similar concerns when he was initially appro@@ ached .
but he was able to work with the council ’ s president to secure an agreement he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to the conflict .
experts can debate whether this was in conformity with un rules and procedures .
i have no doubt that those involved were seeking a way forward that would allow for a full investigation and help overcome the political di@@ visi@@ veness currently undermining the human rights council within the un system .
the question now is whether governments will give judge gol@@ d@@ stone ’ s findings the serious attention they deserve , or instead fall back into an over@@ tly political post@@ ure .
as gol@@ d@@ stone &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s report makes clear :
in this way , both the isra@@ eli@@ s and the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans share a secret fear – for some , a belief – that each has no intention of accepting the other ’ s right to a country of their own .
this anger and fear are unfortunately ably represented by many politicians .
( para . 17@@ 05 )
for the sake of human rights and peace in the region , my hope is that the international community will bear witness to these circumstances , consider judge gol@@ d@@ stone ’ s report in its enti@@ re@@ ty and press for accountability for the most serious crimes .
accounting tri@@ cks around the globe
accounting ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ery will be high on the agenda of the ban@@ kers who will meet at the annual im@@ f / world bank gathering in wash@@ ington , d.@@ c. the im@@ f should do more than offer the private sector advice about how to fix its accounting problems ; governmental accounting tri@@ cks and the im@@ f &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s own whe@@ e@@ zes should also be addressed , says no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate jo@@ se@@ ph sti@@ gl@@ itz .
the ar@@ thur ander@@ son and en@@ ron sc@@ and@@ als in ameri@@ ca have focused attention on the problems of accounting in private businesses .
but the scale of this corruption should not blind us to the problem of public sector accounting , where many dec@@ eit@@ ful things are also being done .
accounting rules are designed to provide standardi@@ zed frameworks within which the financial position of a firm , or government , can be assessed .
bad accounting frameworks always lead to bad information , and bad information leads to bad decisions , with serious long term consequences .
this is true in the public as well as the private sector .
ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s business sc@@ and@@ als showed how accounting rules can be b@@ ent and ab@@ used to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a company .
the b@@ ush administration , not to be left behind , has shown how public accounting rules can be b@@ ent so as to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a national economy .
indeed , last year saw what may be the largest accounting fraud ever conducted , as a me@@ ga@@ -@@ surplus of more than $ 3@@ tril@@ lion for the years 2002 to 2011 was transformed into a $ 2 tril@@ lion deficit .
though sudden and vast , the change in ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fiscal stance already provides a clear in@@ kl@@ ing that something was am@@ iss .
it will be years before the full mag@@ nit@@ ude of president b@@ ush &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s dec@@ eption is apparent .
mean@@ while , the b@@ ush administration will blame the sin@@ king economy , bad luck , and un@@ inten@@ tional mis@@ calculations for the van@@ ished surplus .
but ameri@@ ca is not alone in allowing for official accounting sh@@ en@@ an@@ ig@@ ans .
in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca and elsewhere in the developing world , the im@@ f im@@ poses accounting frameworks that not only make little sense , but result in excessive austerity .
in some of the poorest countries in the world - ie , those most dependent on aid - the im@@ f has argued that foreign aid should not be listed as revenue in a government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s budget calculations .
but what else is aid if it is not revenue ?
the im@@ f &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s argument seems to be this : a country cannot rely on foreign aid because aid is too unstable .
the truth , of course , is that aid is more stable than tax revenues in poor countries .
by the im@@ f &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s logic , neither aid nor tax revenues should be included in budgets .
if that is the case , every country in the world is in deep trouble .
the absur@@ dity here is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to reserves .
but donor countries want to see the money they give to finance schools or health clin@@ ics spent on schools and health clin@@ ics ; they don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t want to see it added to a nation &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s reserves .
governments in developing countries have the correct answer to the problem of revenue instability : expenditure flexibility .
build schools when you have aid ; stop building them when you don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t .
for years , world bank economists have tried to convince the im@@ f to see this logic , with little progress .
other im@@ f accounting practices , including how the capital expendi@@ tures of govern@@ ment-@@ owned enterprises are treated , are also causing ou@@ tra@@ ge .
if a state owned enterprise in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca wants to bor@@ row to make an investment , in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca such borro@@ wing is treated as an addition to the deficit .
investors , worried about the size of a government deficit , see only the bottom line .
but if a company can buy a $ 1 billion asset for $ 500 million , economic logic says buy the asset .
the balance sheet is improved by $ 500 million .
but by im@@ f logic , all you see in the accounts is increased expenditure and borro@@ wing , not the value of the acquired asset .
because of this rule , investors may only see an apparent wor@@ sen@@ ing of the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fiscal position , and so may demand higher interest rates .
of course , foreign investors like this im@@ f logic : government corporations are put at a distinct disadvantage : their ability to invest in@@ hib@@ ited , these firms cannot compete to make acqu@@ isi@@ tions .
a second im@@ f accounting distortion involves stabili@@ zation funds .
these are national funds that , in boom years , receive revenues from sales of natural resources to be set aside against a ra@@ iny day .
this makes sense .
but im@@ f accounting in@@ hib@@ its the use of these funds to help stabili@@ ze an economy through counter-@@ cyc@@ lical fiscal spending .
according to m@@ exi@@ can and chi@@ lean officials i have discussed the matter with , spending from a stabili@@ zation fund is re@@ porte@@ dly treated as if the country is borro@@ wing , thus adding to its deficit .
it is , of course , in times of economic down@@ turn that countries worry most about their credit rating , so the im@@ f stance is particularly un@@ helpful .
im@@ f accounting frameworks , rather than providing useful signals to the market , provide distor@@ ted information that exacerb@@ ates a troub@@ led country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s problems .
good decisions require accurate information , and this comes only through good accounting frameworks .
of course , no perfect accounting framework exists , but some frameworks systematically dist@@ ort .
indeed , a hidden agenda often exists in the choice of an accounting framework .
not including stock options inside the accounting framework served us corporate interests , and those of individual bo@@ ss@@ es , well .
the im@@ f &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s distor@@ ted and unfair accounting frameworks may also serve a hidden purpose : to force governments to shr@@ ink expendi@@ tures .
but there are high economic and social costs to this agenda , one that goes far beyond the im@@ f &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s mandate .
cam@@ bridge – with youth unemployment tou@@ ching 50 % in eurozone countries such as sp@@ ain and gre@@ ece , is a generation being sacri@@ fic@@ ed for the sake of a single currency that encomp@@ asses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable ?
if so , does enlar@@ ging the euro ’ s membership really serve europ@@ e ’ s apparent goal of maxim@@ izing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union ?
the good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether europ@@ e should have a single currency .
the bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that , at least for large countries , currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders .
at a minimum , currency unions require a con@@ federation with far more centr@@ alized power over taxation and other policies than europ@@ ean leaders en@@ vision for the eurozone .
what of no@@ bel prize winner ro@@ bert m@@ und@@ ell ’ s famous 196@@ 1 con@@ jec@@ ture that national and currency borders need not significantly overla@@ p ?
in his pro@@ voc@@ ative ameri@@ can economic review paper “ a theory of optimum currency areas , ” m@@ und@@ ell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were , the region could afford to for@@ go the equi@@ libr@@ ating mechanism of ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate adjustment .
he credi@@ ted another ( future ) no@@ bel prize winner , j@@ ames me@@ ade , for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work , but cri@@ tici@@ zed me@@ ade for interpre@@ ting the idea too str@@ ing@@ ently , especially in the context of europ@@ e ’ s nas@@ cent integration .
m@@ und@@ ell did not emphasize financial crises , but pre@@ sum@@ ably labor mobility is more important today than ever .
not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , workers are leaving the eurozone ’ s crisis countries , but not necessarily for its stronger northern region .
instead , portu@@ gu@@ ese workers are fle@@ eing to bo@@ oming former colon@@ ies such as bra@@ zi@@ l and mac@@ au .
ir@@ ish workers are leaving in dro@@ ves to can@@ ada , au@@ str@@ alia , and the united states . span@@ ish workers are streaming into roman@@ ia , which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in sp@@ ain .
still , if in@@ tra-@@ eurozone mobility were anything like m@@ und@@ ell ’ s ideal , today we would not be seeing 25 % unemployment in sp@@ ain while ger@@ many ’ s unemployment rate is below 7 % .
later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union , which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration .
p@@ eter k@@ enen argued in the late 1960 ’ s that without ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate movements as a shock absor@@ ber , a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk .
some europ@@ ean academ@@ ics tried to argue that there was no need for us-@@ like fiscal transfers , because any desired degree of risk sharing can , in theory , be achieved through financial markets .
this claim was hu@@ gely mis@@ guided .
financial markets can be fragile , and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income , which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy .
k@@ enen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyc@@ lical b@@ ump@@ iness .
but , in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels , the short term can stretch out for a very long time .
many ger@@ mans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will mor@@ ph into a permanent feeding tube , much the way that northern ital@@ y has been pro@@ pping up southern ital@@ y for the last century .
indeed , more than 20 years on , western ger@@ mans still see no end in sight for the bil@@ ls from german unification .
later , mau@@ rice ob@@ st@@ feld pointed out that , in addition to fiscal transfers , a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the l@@ ender of last resort .
otherwise , bank runs and debt pan@@ ics will be ra@@ mp@@ ant .
ob@@ st@@ feld had in mind a ba@@ il@@ out mechanism for banks , but it is now abund@@ antly clear that one also needs a l@@ ender of last resort and a bankrupt@@ cy mechanism for states and municipalities .
a logical cor@@ oll@@ ary of the criteria set forth by k@@ enen and ob@@ st@@ feld , and even of m@@ und@@ ell ’ s lab@@ or-@@ mobility criterion , is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy , most likely involving regi@@ on-@@ wide popular elections .
europ@@ e ’ s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries in@@ definitely without a coherent europ@@ ean political framework .
europ@@ ean policymakers today often compla@@ in that , were it not for the us financial crisis , the eurozone would be doing just fine .
perhaps they are right .
but any financial system must be able to with@@ stand sho@@ cks , including big ones .
europ@@ e may never be an “ optimum ” currency area by any standard .
but , without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade .
a century of chin@@ ese protests
achieving a “ europ@@ e of results ”
br@@ ussel@@ s – the ts@@ un@@ ami that has swe@@ pt across financial markets is a global catastro@@ phe .
if handled correctly , however , the crisis may yet raise the est@@ e@@ em of the europ@@ ean union and its institutions .
the eu ’ s legitimacy problem has two different aspects : ap@@ ath@@ y , leading to a low turn@@ out in the europ@@ ean parliamentary elections , and ou@@ tri@@ ght euro@@ -@@ skep@@ tic@@ ism .
the vo@@ ter-@@ turn@@ out problem partly reflects frustr@@ ation about the present state of the eu , and also people ’ s impression that they can ex@@ ert little influence by voting one way or the other .
euro@@ -@@ skep@@ tic@@ ism , on the other hand , and the lo@@ oming threat of anti-@@ europ@@ ean popul@@ ism , is directly linked to the idea that the eu is not merely inc@@ ap@@ able of offering a solution to the crisis , but in fact is part of the problem .
so , although the eu represents our best hope of ensuring that europ@@ e is internationally competitive in today ’ s increasingly difficult environment , it is actually being bl@@ amed for globalization .
many people conf@@ use these two aspects of the eu ’ s legitimacy problem , and believe that som@@ ehow turn@@ out in europ@@ ean elections can be increased by pointing out to people how good and important the eu is .
but in most cases , this is not possible .
at first sight , the easi@@ est answer to the problem of low vo@@ ter turn@@ out is to give more power to the europ@@ ean parliament .
but if this was the solution , then we would not have had steadily declining turn@@ outs since the high point of 63 % , at the first elections to the europ@@ ean parliament in 1979 .
after all , since then the ep ’ s influence and powers of joint decision-making have grown constantly .
the trouble is that , ep elections must be “ about ” something if voters are to be interested , which means they must involve a real choice .
and a real choice requires europ@@ e-@@ wide election campaigns by all parties .
this would also involve making the choice of the europ@@ ean commission ’ s president dependent on the outcome of the ep elections .
but , in fact , both of these conditions have already been met ; in 2004 , portu@@ gu@@ ese prime minister jo@@ s@@ é manu@@ el dur@@ ão bar@@ ro@@ so was appointed president of the commission because he came from the political organization with the strongest election result , the europ@@ ean people ’ s party .
and this year ’ s elections saw a more intensive presence of party organizations at europ@@ ean level than ever before .
instead , i believe that the most important way to re@@ aw@@ ak@@ en voters ’ interest in europ@@ ean elections will be to open up the election of the commission ’ s president to them , and create a genuinely europ@@ e-@@ wide political debate during the next election campaign .
the euro@@ -@@ skep@@ tic@@ ism problem can be tackled only if the union itself starts to perform better , and is seen to be doing so .
that is why in the after@@ math of the failed refer@@ enda four years ago in fran@@ ce and the ne@@ ther@@ lands on the constitutional treaty , the commission tried to emphasize the idea of a “ europ@@ e of results ” that would seek to convince citizens of its worth through concrete achievements .
given the grav@@ ity of the economic crisis , the time has come for the eu to demonstrate its strengths whenever possible .
the aim must be not only to win back the hearts of europ@@ e@@ ans who have become skep@@ tical , but also to convince them that the union is indispensable to meeting the challenges europ@@ e@@ ans face .
europ@@ e ’ s citizens understand that the relatively small nation@@ -@@ states that make up the eu are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own .
in i@@ reland , last autumn ’ s financial crisis provo@@ ked a turn@@ around in public opinion about the eu , and even in ic@@ eland , although it lies on the peripher@@ y of our continent , membership of the eu and the euro have become a priority .
europ@@ ean countries have become so inter@@ connected that isolated national measures on issues like finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ market regulation are hop@@ eless .
a changing world in which new powers like ch@@ ina and indi@@ a play an increasingly important role will not wait for europ@@ e to make up its mind .
the eu must instead show leadership through its efforts to solve the world ’ s current problems .
as for the europ@@ ean people ’ s party , for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people .
the economic crisis was caused by short@@ si@@ gh@@ te@@ dness and a lack of control in the global financial system .
now we must re@@ define the role of regulators in financial markets and in the wider economy , for we cannot let the financial sector walk off with the profits and leave taxpayers bearing the losses .
that doesn ’ t mean that we are advoc@@ ating a move to soci@@ alism ; we want better and sm@@ ar@@ ter regulation , not regulation for its own sake .
we see five keys to recovery :
a “ europ@@ e of results ” is achie@@ vable .
it can strengthen the eu ’ s legitimacy , though , only if policy recommendations such as these , and the successes that result from implementing them , are communicated clearly and effectively to the general public .
the education road@@ map to 2030
lon@@ don – when i visited the za@@ at@@ ari refugee camp in jord@@ an earlier this year , i met with children who told me what education means to them .
for sy@@ ri@@ an you@@ ths who have been forced from their homes and have lost everything , education is about more than qualifications or test sco@@ res ; it em@@ bodies their hope for the future .
children like those in za@@ at@@ ari , and millions of others around the world , are central to the work of the international commission on financing global education opportunity , which i joined last se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber .
this commission is committed to the fourth united nations sustainable development goal , which aims , by 2030 , to “ ensure inclusive and equ@@ itable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all . ”
this goal is still a distant prospect for far too many children .
with so many development issues demanding our attention , policymakers should bear in mind that education is not just a good in itself ; it is also a cataly@@ st for many other development gains .
as the old afri@@ can pro@@ ver@@ b goes , if you educ@@ ate a girl , you educ@@ ate an entire nation .
ensuring access to quality education for children , especially girls , will lead to fewer child marri@@ ages and less child labor and exploitation .
and education has long-term soci@@ etal benefits : aside from increased political engagement , educated children contribute intellectual capital and pursue entrepreneur@@ ial opportunities when they grow up , boosting economic growth .
tackling the education challenge needs to start from two principles embedded in the goal .
first , “ for all ” means that we must focus on the children who have been left behind .
millions of children are out of school or are receiving a sub@@ standard education because of who they are or where they live .
according to the un high commission@@ er for refugees , refugee children are five times more likely to be out of school than other children in the countries to which they ’ ve been displaced .
and in all but two afri@@ can countries , girls remain less likely than boys to complete a primary education .
getting these children into school will require new approaches that directly address their exclusion and make scho@@ oling genuinely accessible and relevant .
second , “ quality ” : education must be effective , so that children actually learn .
for the 61 million children who are out of primary school , formal education is beyond reach .
but , just as urgently , more than one-@@ third of children of pri@@ mar@@ y-@@ school age – 250 million – are not learning the basi@@ cs , according to the un@@ esco education for all global monitoring report .
half of these children have been in school for at least four years .
we must address the barriers to learning , both in the class@@ room and at home , by improving the quality of teaching and class@@ room conditions and teaching parents how they can support their children ’ s education .
uph@@ ol@@ ding these two principles will require increased investment .
last year , un@@ esco calculated that governments must double education spending as a share of national income to achieve the 2030 goals .
this will require increased revenue from taxation and stronger efforts to collect what ’ s o@@ wed .
donors also need to live up to their aid commitments and target aid more effectively .
for example , less than one-@@ third of education aid goes to afri@@ ca , even though the region accounts for almost two-@@ thirds of out-@@ of-@@ school children .
moreover , at the moment , education budgets are often reg@@ res@@ sive , with almost half of spending in the poorest countries allocated to the most educated 10 % of the population .
fixing education investment requires action in two key areas .
first , we need equ@@ itable financing , with more investment in early childhood care and development , where there is the biggest potential for returns .
budgets must be focused on the most excluded children , and primary education must be free at the point of use , so that every child can learn .
we also urgently need more transparency and accountability , so that budgets are visible and communities have a say in school governance .
second , we need to strengthen domestic education systems so that governments see themselves as the guar@@ ant@@ or of accessible , quality schools for their citizens , rather than ab@@ dic@@ ating that role to outside development agencies .
in particular , we should push for partnerships between government and business to boost domestic resources for education , and eliminate il@@ licit capital flows that depri@@ ve governments of the means to fund it , such as tax ev@@ asion and money laundering across national borders .
with these priorities in mind , the education commission will deliver its recommendations at the un general assembly on se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 18 , when the sec@@ retary-@@ general will receive and act on them .
the education commission will have succeeded if we are able to leverage the funding and political will to ensure that every child lear@@ ns , regardless of their income , location , or social status .
our work will not be complete until that happens .
achieving growth in a re@@ balanced world
mil@@ an – although the financial crisis is win@@ ding down , the prospects for growth in the global economy are unlikely to pick up .
but it is also the result of poor coordination between governments as the world economy re@@ balances .
prior to the crisis , ameri@@ can consumers , on average , either saved nothing or accumul@@ ated debt .
that has now changed .
with household wealth seriously damaged by the housing crash and other ass@@ et-@@ price dec@@ lines , pensions and retirement provisions are in dis@@ array .
because asset prices will not reach pre-@@ crisis levels any@@ time soon ( that is , without infl@@ ating another bub@@ ble and ris@@ king renewed instability ) , household saving in the united states has risen to about 5 % of dis@@ pos@@ able income , and probably will rise further .
this withdrawal of the us consumer is part ( perhaps half ) of the process of re@@ balancing the global economy .
restoring ameri@@ ca ’ s sav@@ ing@@ s-@@ investment balance implies a reduction in global aggreg@@ ate demand of around $ 800 billion .
to be sure , fiscal deficits and emergency measures in advanced economies and some major developing countries have c@@ us@@ hi@@ oned the sharp decline , sub@@ stit@@ uting in part for missing consumers .
but this sub@@ stitution cannot continue in@@ definitely .
in advanced countries , governments will eventually be forced to reduce spending , and central banks will withdraw from emergency credit provisions and guarantees .
as a result , many believe that a “ new normal ” of s@@ lower adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country growth is upon us .
despite a recovery in asset prices in many countries and the dec@@ eler@@ ation of negative growth , unemployment is high and rising .
risk spre@@ ads have declined from their mid-@@ crisis high@@ s , but credit in many sectors remains tight or barely available , while the financial sector is set to become more conservative – and is likely to be re-@@ regulated with higher capital , reserve , and margin requirements .
and this is just the bas@@ el@@ ine scenario .
down@@ side risks include fiscal dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zation resulting from a failure to rein in deficits , inflation and withdrawal of central bank autonomy , and loss of confidence in the dollar , which continues to be the reserve currency for the global economy .
little wonder , then , that many knowled@@ ge@@ able an@@ al@@ yst@@ s reasonably expect post-@@ crisis growth in advanced countries to be lower , perhaps by 0.5 to 1 % .
a 1 % slow@@ down in adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country growth transl@@ ates into roughly $ 350 billion of missing aggreg@@ ate demand every year , in addition to the short@@ fall because of re@@ balancing in the us .
if the slow@@ down in advanced countries pers@@ ists , pre-@@ crisis growth levels will not be achie@@ vable in the developing world either , owing to insufficient demand to absor@@ b the imp@@ lied increase in output .
of course , individual developing countries may be sp@@ ared .
but it is an unfortunate mathemati@@ cal fact that not everyone can gain market share .
if the adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country scenario is right , many developing countries will lose out and experience sharp@@ ly dimin@@ ished growth .
prior to the crisis , many suspected that the mix of aggreg@@ ate demand that was supporting high growth was un@@ sustainable , though the problem perhaps seemed too hypo@@ theti@@ cal to comp@@ el collective action .
but the collective action problem is no less da@@ un@@ ting , and it requires urgent attention if the world ’ s growth aspirations are to be achieved .
the problem is all the more pressing because countries can achieve gains in market share not only through higher priv@@ ate-@@ sector competitiveness , but also by means of protection@@ ist measures .
and , as we have seen in many countries ’ efforts to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate the crisis , the non-@@ cooperative protection@@ ist response is much more likely to be adopted – despite wide recognition that it is highly destruc@@ tive – when aggreg@@ ate demand is in short supply .
so what can be done to shore up global aggreg@@ ate demand and growth prospects , while preserving the economic openness that has benefited major parts of the developing world so greatly in the past 30 years ?
first , countries with curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses such as ger@@ many , jap@@ an and ch@@ ina must recognize that their own growth ( and that of others ) depends on reducing the global sav@@ ing@@ s-@@ investment im@@ balance , which will result in narro@@ wing external deficits elsewhere .
this needs to be done on a sustained basis following the withdrawal of extraordinary fiscal stimulus .
second , everyone must recognize their stake in restoring balanced adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country growth as much and as soon as possible in order to counter the ongoing short@@ fall in aggreg@@ ate demand .
after all , advanced countries account for about two-@@ thirds of global g@@ d@@ p , so slow growth in these countries will inevitably impede global growth and tr@@ un@@ c@@ ate the growth potential of much of the developing world .
this challenge , however , is very complex because dele@@ ver@@ aging and re@@ balancing cannot be completed overnight .
but key steps can and should be taken : restoration of fiscal balance in well-@@ communicated plans , commitment to central bank autonomy and low inflation , and striking a thou@@ ghtful balance between under@@ - and over-@@ regulation of the financial sector .
extern@@ ally , major trading partners and holders of adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country assets can support re@@ balancing by agreeing to avoid sudden and potentially dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing shi@@ fts in the composition of their balance sheets .
so , two crucial items must claim priority at the top of the world ’ s economic agenda in the months ahead .
the first is re-@@ regulation of advanced countries financial systems with a view to ensuring greater stability without im@@ pa@@ iring essential functions or un@@ necessarily elev@@ ating the cost of capital .
the second is a set of understand@@ ings and commitments among the major advanced and developing countries to re@@ balance the global economy in order to restore aggreg@@ ate demand and growth .
if that can be accomplished , the world will have taken a major step toward a relatively smooth , effective , and equ@@ itable global economic recovery .
su@@ sta@@ ining progress in transition countries
new y@@ or@@ k – in the world bank ’ s most recent “ doing business ” report , half of the eastern europ@@ ean and central asi@@ an countries included in the global ranking were among the top 50 . as a measure of economic mat@@ urity , the report confirms what many in the international development community have long known : the region is as@@ c@@ end@@ ant .
over the last decade , the economies of eastern europ@@ e and central a@@ sia have recorded spectacular gains , but@@ t@@ res@@ sed by ambitious market and public-@@ sector reforms .
the question now is how to ensure that this progress – which has tri@@ pled the size of the middle class – is sustained .
signs of the region ’ s social and economic prosperity are everywhere .
in az@@ er@@ ba@@ ij@@ an , incomes have increased dramatically in recent decades , and only 5 % of the population now lives below the poverty line – down from nearly 50 % in 2002 .
elsewhere , est@@ onia is the third country in europ@@ e in star@@ tu@@ ps per person and has one of the fastest internet speeds anywhere .
and from alb@@ ania to k@@ yr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , e-@@ government systems are allowing more people to connect with critical services through online and electronic port@@ als .
but while it is temp@@ ting to assume that the region is dest@@ ined for prosperity , structural bott@@ len@@ ecks continue to slow progress , especially in the western bal@@ kan@@ s , the southern cau@@ casus , and parts of central a@@ sia .
to maintain momentum in meeting the united nations sustainable development goals ( s@@ d@@ gs ) by 2030 , leaders must address three key issues .
first , the region ’ s economies need to be strengthened to inc@@ enti@@ vi@@ ze sm@@ ar@@ ter , more sustainable growth .
for example , fossi@@ l-@@ fuel subsidies should be re@@ considered , because they dis@@ courage investment in energy-@@ efficiency projects , and impede the development of renewable technologies .
simil@@ arly , while public financing of pensions and welfare programs is dependent on tax@@ ing labor , much of the region currently suff@@ ers from high rates of unemployment ; in the western bal@@ kan@@ s , there are nearly no jobs , or none at all .
job creation is an urgent challenge for every state in the region .
second , in many countries , the space for civil society is becoming narro@@ wer , posing a threat to plur@@ alism and accountability .
to prevent conflict and give voice to the region ’ s margin@@ alized groups , tolerance and respect for human rights must be made essential ingredients of governance .
finally , the region must coordinate on strategies to address the changes that automation and artificial intelligence will bring to the labor market .
leaders in some countries , particularly bel@@ ar@@ us , are shi@@ fting economic output from heavy manufacturing to technology star@@ tu@@ ps .
but authorities everywhere can do more to increase the re@@ sili@@ ence of their work@@ forces .
fortunately , governments , technology companies , civil@@ -@@ society groups , and journalists recognize the s@@ ali@@ ence of these issues and are working together to build more transparent and accountable institutions .
in many countries , heads of government are using the s@@ d@@ gs to guide their national planning and efforts to legisl@@ ate reforms .
the parliaments of several central asi@@ an countries have even endorsed the s@@ d@@ gs as a development road@@ map .
changes like these are helping to translate development ambition into action .
in ar@@ men@@ ia , the government recently created the world ’ s first national s@@ d@@ g innovation laboratory , a collabor@@ ative effort designed to “ accelerate ” s@@ d@@ g implementation .
initial research efforts will focus on increasing the country ’ s tax collection , improving its education system , and boosting its renew@@ ab@@ le-@@ energy sector .
mean@@ while , planning officials in mol@@ do@@ va have used crow@@ d@@ funding to raise millions of dollars from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a to fund sustainable development projects at home .
rev@@ itali@@ zation efforts have included the reconstruction of a public pla@@ za in the capital , chi@@ ș@@ in@@ ă@@ u , and the expansion of infrastructure in rural areas .
the region ’ s private sector is also participating actively in sustainable development efforts .
from sie@@ mens ’ green heating and air conditioning systems to uni@@ le@@ ver ’ s “ equal pay for equal work ” policy , multinational firms operating in eastern europ@@ e and central a@@ sia are embra@@ cing sustainability and equality as viable business models .
in only a few decades , the people of eastern europ@@ e and central a@@ sia have witnessed profound political and economic changes .
to cap@@ itali@@ ze on the development progress already made , countries and organizations must learn from one another , adapting solutions to local conditions .
that will be the main topic at the ist@@ an@@ bul development dialo@@ gues , an annual global gathering organized by the un development programme , this week .
as the new und@@ p strategic plan for 201@@ 8-@@ 20@@ 21 argu@@ es , collaboration is a critical component to any sustain@@ ab@@ le-@@ development strategy .
if the measure of a country can be calculated by how easily business is conducted within its borders , the states of eastern europ@@ e and central a@@ sia have a bright future .
with strong leadership that trans@@ forms the region ’ s economies and moderni@@ zes its institutions , the region ’ s recent gains will not be fle@@ eting .
the ach@@ illes ’ he@@ el of tru@@ mp@@ onom@@ ics
new haven – don@@ ald tru@@ mp ’ s economic strategy is severely fla@@ wed .
the us pre@@ sident@@ -@@ elect wants to restore growth via deficit spending in a country with a chronic short@@ fall of saving .
this points to a further compres@@ sion in national saving , making a wi@@ dening of an already out@@ size trade gap all but inevitable .
that dynamic un@@ mas@@ ks the ach@@ illes ’ he@@ el of tru@@ mp@@ onom@@ ics : a b@@ lat@@ ant protection@@ ist bi@@ as that col@@ li@@ des head@@ -@@ on with ameri@@ ca ’ s in@@ es@@ capable reli@@ ance on foreign saving and trade deficits to sustain economic growth .
the tru@@ mp administration will not inher@@ it a strong and sound us economy .
the pace of recovery since the great recession has been running at half that of normal cyc@@ lical re@@ bo@@ unds – all the more distur@@ bing given the massive size of the contra@@ ction in 2008-@@ 09 .
and savings , the seed cor@@ n of future prosperity , remain in wo@@ efully short supply .
the so-called net national saving rate – the de@@ preci@@ ation-@@ adjusted sum of business , household , and government saving – stood at just 2.4 % of national income in mid-@@ 2016 .
while that ’ s an improvement from the unprecedented negative saving position in 2008-@@ 2011 , it remains far short of the 6.@@ 3 % average that prev@@ ailed over the final three decades of the twen@@ tieth century .
this is important because it explains the per@@ ni@@ cious trade deficits that tru@@ mp continues to rail against .
lacking in saving and wanting to grow , the united states must import surplus saving from abroad .
and the only way to attract that foreign capital is by running massive curr@@ ent-@@ account and trade deficits .
the numbers bear this out : since 2000 , when national saving fell well below trend , the curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit has wi@@ dened to an average of 3.@@ 8 % of g@@ d@@ p – nearly four times the 1 % gap from 1970 to 1999 .
simil@@ arly , the net export deficit – the broad@@ est measure of a country ’ s trade im@@ balance – has been 4 % of g@@ d@@ p since 2000 , ver@@ sus an average of 1.1 % over the final three decades of the twen@@ tieth century .
tru@@ mp@@ onom@@ ics has the cause and effect behind this development back@@ wards .
it fix@@ ates on countr@@ y-@@ specific sources of the trade deficit , like ch@@ ina and m@@ ex@@ ico , but mis@@ ses the fundamental point that these bilateral deficits are symptoms of ameri@@ ca ’ s far deeper saving problem .
presu@@ me for the moment that the us clos@@ es down trade with ch@@ ina and m@@ ex@@ ico – the first and fourth largest components of the overall trade deficit – through a combination of tariffs and other protection@@ ist measures ( including the proposed ren@@ egoti@@ ation of n@@ af@@ ta and a m@@ ex@@ ic@@ an-@@ funded border wall ) .
without addressing ameri@@ ca ’ s chronic saving shortage , the chin@@ ese and m@@ exi@@ can components of the trade deficit would simply be re@@ distributed to other countries – most likely to hig@@ her@@ -@@ cost producers .
the result would be the functional equivalent of a tax hi@@ ke on bele@@ agu@@ ered mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class us families .
in short , there is no bilateral fix for a multilateral problem .
the us had trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015 – a multilateral problem stem@@ ming from a saving short@@ fall that cannot be effectively addressed through countr@@ y-@@ specific “ remedies . ”
that ’ s not to say that ameri@@ ca ’ s trading partners should be let off the ho@@ ok for unfair practices .
but it does mean that there is limited hope for resolving seem@@ ingly chronic trade deficits – and the related ero@@ sion of domestic h@@ iring trac@@ eable to these imbalances – if the us doesn ’ t start saving again .
al@@ as , this plot is about to thi@@ cken .
tru@@ mp@@ onom@@ ics seems likely to exacerb@@ ate ameri@@ ca ’ s saving short@@ fall in the years ahead .
analyses by the tax policy center , the tax foundation , and mo@@ o@@ dy ’ s analy@@ tics all indicate that federal budget deficits under tru@@ mp ’ s economic plan are headed back toward at least 7 % of g@@ d@@ p over the next ten years .
tru@@ mp ’ s senior econom@@ ic-@@ policy advis@@ ers , p@@ eter nav@@ ar@@ ro and wil@@ bu@@ r ro@@ ss ( tru@@ mp &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s pick for commerce secret@@ ary ) , argued in a position paper in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber that these estimates are fla@@ wed , because they don ’ t take into account “ grow@@ th-@@ in@@ duc@@ ing wind@@ falls ” from regulatory and energy reforms , or the added bon@@ an@@ za that should arise from a sharp narro@@ wing of ameri@@ ca ’ s trade deficit .
indeed , the nav@@ arro@@ -@@ ro@@ ss analysis attri@@ butes fully 73 % of the grow@@ th-@@ in@@ duc@@ ing revenue wind@@ fall of tru@@ mp@@ onom@@ ics to a massive improvement in the overall trade balance over the next decade .
yet , as stressed above , bar@@ ring a mi@@ ra@@ culous sur@@ ge in national saving , this is highly du@@ bi@@ ous .
creative accounting , long a st@@ ap@@ le of sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ side economics , has never been more imagin@@ ative .
ther@@ ein lies one of the most g@@ lar@@ ing dis@@ connec@@ ts of tru@@ mp@@ onom@@ ics .
getting tough on trade at a time when national saving is about to come under ever-@@ greater pressure simply doesn ’ t add up .
even the most conservative estimates of the federal budget deficit suggest that the al@@ read@@ y-@@ de@@ pressed net national saving rate could re-@@ enter negative territory at some point in the 201@@ 8-@@ 201@@ 9 period .
that would put renewed pressure on the curr@@ ent-@@ account and trade deficits , making it extremely difficult to reverse the loss of jobs and income that politicians are quick to blame on ameri@@ ca ’ s trading partners .
ir@@ on@@ ically , in the coming era of negative saving , the us will find itself increasingly dependent on surplus saving from abroad .
if the tru@@ mp administration takes aim at major foreign len@@ ders – namely , ch@@ ina – its strategy could quickly back@@ fire .
at a minimum , there could be an adverse impact on the terms by which ameri@@ ca borro@@ ws from abroad ; that could mean higher interest rates – hin@@ ts of which are already evident – and ultimately down@@ ward pressure on the dollar .
protectionism , an@@ em@@ ic saving , and deficit spending make for an especially toxic cocktail .
under tru@@ mp@@ onom@@ ics , it will be exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly difficult to make ameri@@ ca great again .
a chin@@ ese champi@@ on of peace and freedom
for his bra@@ very and clarity of thought about ch@@ ina ’ s future , li@@ u deserves the 2010 no@@ bel peace prize . there are two reasons why we believe that li@@ u would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award .
first and foremost , he stands in the tradition of no@@ bel peace prize lau@@ re@@ ates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights . no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates such as mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king , le@@ ch wal@@ esa , and a@@ ung s@@ an su@@ u k@@ y@@ i are but a few of the many examples that the no@@ bel committee has recognized in previous years .
we are convinced that the concepts that li@@ u and his colleagues put down on paper in dec@@ ember 2008 are both universal and tim@@ eless . these ide@@ als – respect for human rights and human dignity , and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights – represent humanity ’ s highest aspirations .
should the no@@ bel committee choose to recognize li@@ u ’ s courage and sacrifi@@ ce in articul@@ ating these ide@@ als , it would not only draw global attention to the in@@ justice of li@@ u ’ s 1@@ 1-@@ year sentence . it would also help to amp@@ li@@ fy within ch@@ ina the universal and human@@ istic values for which li@@ u has spent so much of his life fighting .
the second reason why li@@ u deserves the no@@ bel peace prize res@@ on@@ ates with al@@ fred no@@ bel ’ s original intent for the award . in working to promote human rights , political reform , and democrati@@ zation in ch@@ ina , li@@ u has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fr@@ at@@ ernity among nations that no@@ bel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago .
but it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state ’ s foreign and domestic policies . this active and searching convers@@ ation , the hall@@ mark of a democratic pol@@ ity , is the best hope for better decisions by governments , both at home and abroad .
li@@ u ’ s committed advoc@@ acy on behalf of democracy in ch@@ ina is , above all , intended for the benefit of the chin@@ ese people . but his courage and example may help to accelerate the da@@ wn of the day when ch@@ ina ’ s participation in international affairs is ai@@ ded by the expertise and over@@ sight of civil@@ -@@ society groups , an independent media , and an engaged citiz@@ en@@ ry able to express its views through the bal@@ lot box .
it is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that li@@ u would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 no@@ bel peace prize . in confer@@ ring on li@@ u one of the world ’ s highest hon@@ ors , the committee would be sign@@ aling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand , and world peace and international solidarity on the other .
li@@ u ’ s har@@ sh prison sentence was meant as an exempl@@ ary measure , a stern warning to all other chin@@ ese who might want to follow his path . we are convinced that there are moments when exempl@@ ary civi@@ c engagement , such as li@@ u ’ s , requires an exempl@@ ary response .
a civili@@ zation in crisis
a climate deal is not enough
am@@ ster@@ dam – during the cop@@ 15 climate summit in cop@@ enhagen , world leaders have been negotiating the future of our planet .
all the signs suggest that they are unlikely to sign a global climate treaty .
the views of the various countries , and of the various industrial and political power b@@ loc@@ s , differ too much .
the politicians , civil servants , and other participants at the cop@@ enhagen summit have mainly been bom@@ bar@@ ding each other with numbers . figures on how much various countries should reduce co@@ 2 emissions , the amount of money they should put up in coming years , the exact nature of their responsibilities , how much temperature increase earth will be able to end@@ ure , and how long we can continue to wait .
these are all very important issues .
but the mere figures are simply not enough .
a different approach to the problem of climate change is needed .
the climate issue can only be solved on the basis of shared , deeply felt ethical principles .
humanity has reached a critical moment in earth ’ s history , at which peoples and nations will have to recognize their solidarity – with each other and with the earth – and start acting upon it .
similar to the way world leaders adopted the united nations mill@@ enni@@ um declaration in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 2000 , and embra@@ ced the resulting mill@@ enni@@ um development goals , today ’ s climate negoti@@ ators will have to commit themselves to creating a basis of shared fundamental ethical principles .
such a basis is not hard to find .
its inspiration can be the earth charter , which , launched in 2000 , was initiated by , among others , former uss@@ r president mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il gor@@ b@@ ach@@ e@@ v and wan@@ gar@@ i ma@@ th@@ a@@ ai , who received the 2004 no@@ bel peace prize for her efforts in the green belt movement , a pan@@ -@@ afri@@ can tre@@ e-@@ plan@@ ting initiative .
the climate problem does not stop at borders .
in the next few decades , a low-@@ lying country like the ne@@ ther@@ lands will need to invest billions of euros to intensify its age-@@ old struggle against rising water .
but in many other countries , the water is already floo@@ ding over the di@@ kes , both literally and figur@@ atively .
climate change affects particularly those countries that lack the money needed to take adequate measures against rising sea levels , persistent d@@ rou@@ ghts , or devastating stor@@ ms , even though they had nothing to do with the primary cause of these problems – industri@@ alization in the developed countries .
apart from the necessary , often infra@@ structural adap@@ tations to survive the effects of climate change , enormous efforts to prevent even worse things from happening are required .
large investments in fore@@ station , agriculture , and energy supply are called for .
in de@@ vising solutions , the role of women should be the main focus .
women are often the first people who have to address the problem of gaining access to natural resources , and they are capable of playing a major role as pione@@ ers in finding solutions to climate change and the way human@@ kind should adapt to it .
in the short term , the world should become a sustainable global society of low co@@ 2 emit@@ ters .
this is a mission for all human@@ kind , in which patri@@ o@@ tic feelings and thinking in terms of power b@@ loc@@ s have no place .
the pursuit of a sustainable global society of low co@@ 2 emit@@ ters requires a tremendous effort .
precisely for this reason , it also requires a broadly shared ethical basis .
this would guide the negotiating parties in such a way that they look not only for solutions to a part of the problem , but first and foremost at a comprehensive solution to the entire problem .
the climate change issue is too important to be left in the care of politicians .
in cop@@ enhagen , it is therefore imperative that not only nation states , but the business community and citizens combine their efforts to save our planet ’ s climate .
that is not only a scientific necessity ; it is an ethical imperative .
a clo@@ ck@@ work chem@@ istry
ox@@ ford – in an@@ th@@ ony bur@@ ges@@ s ’ s nov@@ ella ( and stan@@ ley ku@@ bri@@ ck ’ s film ) a clo@@ ck@@ work orange , al@@ ex , an un@@ rep@@ ent@@ ant psych@@ op@@ ath , has his eyes pri@@ ed wide open and is forced to watch violent images .
like pav@@ lo@@ v ’ s dog , al@@ ex is being programm@@ ed to respond with nau@@ sea to violence and sex .
this scene remains sho@@ cking , but , like most science fic@@ tion , it has aged .
the behavi@@ or@@ ist psych@@ ology it drew upon has long exp@@ ired , and the fear that science will be used to make , or even force , people to be mor@@ ally better now sounds ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned .
science fic@@ tion ages fast , but it has a long after@@ life .
over the past decade , an army of psych@@ ologists , neuro@@ scientists , and e@@ volu@@ tionary bi@@ ologists has been busy trying to un@@ cover the ne@@ ural “ clo@@ ck@@ work ” that under@@ lies human mor@@ ality .
they have started to trace the e@@ volu@@ tionary origins of pro-@@ social senti@@ ments such as em@@ pa@@ thy , and have begun to un@@ cover the genes that dis@@ pose some individuals to sen@@ sel@@ ess violence and others to acts of al@@ tru@@ ism , and the path@@ ways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions .
and to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it .
indeed , scientists have not only identified some of the brain path@@ ways that shape our ethical decisions , but also chemical substances that modul@@ ate this ne@@ ural activity .
a recent study has shown that the anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant c@@ ital@@ op@@ ra@@ m can change the responses of individuals to hypo@@ theti@@ cal moral di@@ lemma scenarios .
another series of studies has shown that when the hor@@ m@@ one ox@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is administer@@ ed via nas@@ al spra@@ y , it increases tru@@ sting and cooperative behavior within social groups , but also decre@@ ases cooperation with those perceived as out@@ si@@ ders .
neuro@@ scientists have even magne@@ tically “ z@@ apped ” carefully targeted areas of people ’ s bra@@ ins to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways – for example , making it easier for them to lie .
of course , no one is developing a “ moral pil@@ l ” that will transform us into sa@@ ints .
but the research is adv@@ ancing fast , and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to res@@ ha@@ pe our moral intui@@ tions , senti@@ ments , and motiv@@ ations .
should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human mor@@ ality to try to make people mor@@ ally better ?
a clo@@ ck@@ work orange was accused of gl@@ ori@@ fying violence , and some of its scenes are still hard to watch .
but as bur@@ ges@@ s himself argued , the nov@@ ella has an almost ch@@ ris@@ tian message : what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil , and for society to cr@@ ush individuals into servi@@ le conformity is as wick@@ ed as , and perhaps even worse than , the sad@@ ism of psych@@ op@@ a@@ ths like al@@ ex .
i suspect that many will agree with this view .
they will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard , not a broken clock that scientists should fix .
of course , most of us don ’ t need to be conditioned to feel rep@@ ul@@ sed by rap@@ e or torture .
but this does not mean that we are mor@@ ally good , or good enough .
as you read this , perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing un@@ speak@@ able things to others .
even in the most advanced and aff@@ lu@@ ent societies , a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal dec@@ ency : think of lo@@ cks , security al@@ arms , police , courts , and pris@@ ons .
and it is doub@@ tful that we really care enough about others , or give enough to the less fortunate .
humans are born with the capacity to be moral , but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical comple@@ xi@@ ties of the modern world .
for thousands of years , humans have re@@ lied on education , persu@@ asion , social institutions , and the threat of real ( or super@@ natural ) punishment to make people be@@ have dec@@ ently .
we could all be mor@@ ally better , but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further .
it is not as if people would suddenly begin to be@@ have better if we just gave them more facts and statistics , or better arguments .
so we sh@@ ouldn ’ t be too quick to dis@@ miss the suggestion that science might help – in the first instance , by helping us design more effective institutions , more inspir@@ ing moral education , or more persu@@ a@@ sive ethical arguments .
but science might also offer more direct ways of influ@@ encing our bra@@ ins .
it would be self-@@ defe@@ ating , or worse , to try to promote mor@@ ality through brutal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
governments must not be given the power to control its citizens ’ moral code – we know that if they had such power , they would mis@@ use it .
it would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves , whether by practic@@ ing min@@ d@@ fulness , reading moral philosophy , or , yes , by taking a ’ mor@@ ality ’ pil@@ l .
but it is also true that although some people are e@@ ager to take p@@ ills that make them feel better or think faster , it is not so obvious that people would really want to take p@@ ills that would make them mor@@ ally better .
it is not clear that people really want to be mor@@ ally better .
and those who , like the psych@@ opath@@ ic al@@ ex , need the most help are probably those who would want it least .
these are , of course , hypo@@ theti@@ cal questions .
we don ’ t yet know what is possible .
but it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late .
and even if “ moral p@@ ills ” are just science fic@@ tion , they raise deep questions .
will we want to take them if they ever become available ?
and what does it say about us if we won ’ t ?
a cl@@ oud over air@@ plane safety
pr@@ inc@@ et@@ on – when airports across europ@@ e re@@ opened after the closure caused by the erup@@ tion of ic@@ eland ’ s ey@@ j@@ af@@ j@@ al@@ la@@ j@@ ö@@ kul@@ l volcan@@ o , it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped , but because the risk that the ash posed to air@@ plane safety had been re@@ assessed .
was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban , or was it a reflection of the hard@@ ship , both personal and economic , that the ban was causing ?
over six days , about 95@@ ,000 flights were can@@ cel@@ ed , at a cost to airlines of more than $ 1 billion .
an estimated five million people were str@@ anded or delayed .
the bri@@ tish economy lost £ 1.5 billion , and others were simil@@ arly affected .
flower gro@@ wers in ken@@ ya , who depend on air transport to take their short-@@ lived product to europ@@ e , suddenly had no income .
six@@ teen cancer patients in critical need of bone mar@@ row for transp@@ lan@@ ts were put at risk because the matching mar@@ row could not be flo@@ wn in from the united states or can@@ ada .
in the past , je@@ ts flying into ash from volcan@@ oes in the us , in@@ don@@ esia , the p@@ hili@@ pp@@ ines , and m@@ ex@@ ico have temporarily lost engine power , and in one case , dropped thousands of feet , although all managed to land safely .
but there was no evidence that the more widely dis@@ per@@ sed ash b@@ lowing over europ@@ e from ic@@ eland would cause similar problems .
the decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft , and that no matter how slight that risk might be , the government ’ s job was , as bri@@ tish prime minister g@@ ord@@ on bro@@ wn put it , “ to make sure that safety was par@@ amount . ”
indeed , in closing their sk@@ ies , europ@@ ean governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else .
yet none of them act on that principle in other areas .
some 3@@ ,000 people die on the world ’ s roads every day .
cutting speed limits to , say , 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives .
we don ’ t do it , because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving .
the price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be in@@ fin@@ ite .
it is dis@@ taste@@ ful to put a price on human life , but the more we spend on safety , the less we will have for our other goals .
the bri@@ tish government uses a figure of a little more than £ 1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life – for example , by improving road safety .
in the us , the department of transportation is prepared to go up to $ 5.@@ 8 million – nearly four times as much , at current exchange rates – for the same purpose .
does that mean that safety is par@@ amount in the us , but not in b@@ rit@@ ain ?
gi@@ ov@@ anni bis@@ ign@@ ani , the head of the international air transport association , an industry group , cri@@ tici@@ zed the sh@@ ut@@ down , saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken .
on the whole , though , the public seemed to support the decision .
str@@ anded travel@@ ers , inter@@ viewed at airports , typically said that they would rather be stu@@ ck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky .
but what if some travel@@ ers have a higher tolerance of risk , or just a more urgent need to travel , than others ?
j@@ oh@@ n stu@@ art mill , in his classic book on liberty , considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is un@@ safe .
in mill ’ s view , we are justified in st@@ opping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger .
once he knows of it , the decision is his to make , because only he can judge the importance of his journey , and balance that against the risk he is running .
air safety is slightly different , because a cr@@ ash@@ ing plane can kill people on the ground , but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew .
if they are fully informed of the risks , and are still willing to fly – perhaps the crew has been offered more money , as workers in dangerous occup@@ ations often are – should we prevent them from making the decision to fly ?
in the end , after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage , and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere , europ@@ e ’ s sk@@ ies were re@@ opened .
the international civil aviation authority has announced that it will conven@@ e a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it un@@ safe to fly .
now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety , we know that this is not only a technical question .
i trust that among the experts will be some who have p@@ onder@@ ed the underlying ethical question : how safe should we aim to be ?
a communist party without commun@@ ism
pr@@ inc@@ et@@ on – rus@@ sian president v@@ ladimir pu@@ tin ’ s ano@@ in@@ tment of al@@ ex@@ ander me@@ d@@ ve@@ dev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next mar@@ ch shows that rus@@ sia ’ s leaders have not changed a wh@@ it .
it looks increasingly likely that , as under le@@ on@@ id bre@@ zh@@ ne@@ v , we will see the same names in the news for decades to come .
according to gle@@ b pav@@ lov@@ sky , the pu@@ tin regime ’ s leading ide@@ olog@@ ist , the current rus@@ sian system is perfect in all respects but one : it doesn ’ t know its enemies .
indeed , it seems as if everyone in the kre@@ m@@ lin is reading car@@ l sch@@ mit@@ t , the n@@ az@@ i legal the@@ or@@ ist who taught that nam@@ ing your enemy is the central mission of politics .
in the spirit of sch@@ mit@@ t , pu@@ tin ’ s men designated a liberal party , the union of right forces , as their ur-@@ enemy .
its public meetings were broken up by armed police ; its leaders arrested and be@@ aten ; pu@@ tin called its supporters “ co@@ yo@@ tes . ”
what is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger . oil prices are so@@ aring , as are pu@@ tin ’ s approval rat@@ ings .
his appoin@@ tees control everything that matters , from ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m to the central electoral committee .
since the p@@ aci@@ fication of che@@ chn@@ ya with violence and subsidies , the inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation or em@@ ig@@ ration of a few financially viable opponents , and the massive “ social investments ” of recent years , which , under me@@ d@@ ve@@ dev ’ s personal supervision , have bri@@ bed the population , no credible force can seriously challenge pu@@ tin ’ s men .
yet their regime is in crisis , and they know it .
rus@@ sia ’ s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before .
military reform has been revers@@ ed .
despite increasing incomes , rus@@ si@@ ans are less educated and less healthy than they were when pu@@ tin came to power ; they still die at a sho@@ ck@@ ingly young age .
rus@@ sian involvement in world affairs is tain@@ ted by po@@ ison and corruption .
state monopolies und@@ o what private businesses created .
with more money , ill-@@ educated bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats hire more ill-@@ educated bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats ; as a result , the regime fails to rule the country .
the country is un@@ ru@@ ly , and its rul@@ ers know it .
so they pan@@ ic .
pu@@ tin ’ s aim was to subject all power to the control of rus@@ sia ’ s security forces .
his generation of k@@ g@@ b officers wat@@ ched the collapse of the communist party and all the governmental bodies that it “ directed and controlled , ” including the k@@ g@@ b .
under pu@@ tin , the security service has had its re@@ ven@@ ge .
its people have become powerful , arro@@ gan@@ t , and enor@@ m@@ ously rich .
they have also become dis@@ o@@ bedient .
in 2004 , general vi@@ ktor cher@@ kes@@ ov , then pu@@ tin ’ s representative in nor@@ thwest rus@@ sia , published an es@@ say that gl@@ ori@@ fied the k@@ g@@ b as the only un@@ spo@@ iled authority in a cor@@ rupted country .
this es@@ say , more than anything else , defined pu@@ tin ’ s second term .
in oc@@ tober 2007 , cher@@ kes@@ ov ( now chief of one of the most ob@@ sc@@ ure and powerful services , the federal anti-@@ drug administration ) published another es@@ say in which he la@@ mented his colleagues ’ degra@@ dation : war@@ ri@@ ors had turned into traders , he compla@@ ined .
earlier , gener@@ als from a competing service , the fs@@ b , had arrested cher@@ kes@@ ov ’ s dep@@ uty for “ illegal bu@@ gging . ”
in a public gest@@ ure of des@@ pair , cher@@ kes@@ ov admitted the failure of pu@@ tin ’ s project to re@@ anim@@ ate rus@@ sian governance by sub@@ ordin@@ ating it to the security services .
cher@@ kes@@ ov ’ s dep@@ uty remains in prison .
in the absence of communist party control , these security officers betra@@ yed their corporate eth@@ ic and engaged in hor@@ se-@@ trading , applying force when a trade did not go well .
that this happens to ordinary rus@@ si@@ ans is clear ; what cher@@ kes@@ ov revealed was that pu@@ tin ’ s circle also confron@@ ts this situation .
what is to be done when ex-@@ k@@ g@@ b war@@ ri@@ ors turn their s@@ words and bugs against one another ?
cher@@ kes@@ ov ’ s case exemp@@ li@@ fies pu@@ tin ’ s night@@ mare .
but if your inst@@ inc@@ ts betra@@ y you , you go back to even deeper ones .
now that pu@@ tin ’ s people have left their predec@@ essors ’ neo-@@ liberal ideas behind and feel dis@@ enchan@@ ted with the ex-@@ k@@ g@@ b cli@@ que , the task is to recre@@ ate an om@@ ni@@ present political party that controls the security services , the administration , business , and much else .
this party will be centr@@ alized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fic@@ tion .
pre@@ aching nation@@ alism , its managers will believe in their universal competence , as opposed to k@@ g@@ b-@@ style profession@@ alism and corpor@@ atis@@ m .
bor@@ is yel@@ ts@@ in for@@ ba@@ de party cells in state-@@ controlled institutions by decre@@ e .
pu@@ tin ’ s lawyers will reverse that decision ; the party will have cells or committees in every factory , cor@@ poration , military unit , university department , etc .
integrated by the leader ’ s char@@ is@@ ma and party discipline , party members will direct and uni@@ fy the des@@ ol@@ ated country .
like former so@@ vi@@ et leader y@@ ur@@ i and@@ ro@@ po@@ v , the only other k@@ g@@ b man to rule rus@@ sia , pu@@ tin will become the party ’ s general secret@@ ary .
as in the so@@ vi@@ et era , state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ci@@ ph@@ ers – the role that president me@@ d@@ ve@@ dev will play under general secret@@ ary pu@@ tin .
and , of course , being general secret@@ ary carries no constitutional term limit .
in the end , pu@@ tin has what history left him : not ideas , just a fac@@ tion year@@ ning to consolidate its gri@@ p on power .
len@@ in and tro@@ ts@@ ky needed a party to make their ideology a reality ; pu@@ tin and me@@ d@@ ve@@ dev are de@@ vising an ideology to solidi@@ fy their party .
it is a bizar@@ re ideology .
acc@@ using war@@ ri@@ ors of being traders and traders of being th@@ ie@@ ves , it sh@@ uns its mar@@ x@@ ist origins .
it will sub@@ ordin@@ ate all who really do work – traders , war@@ ri@@ ors , journalists , and others – to party ide@@ olo@@ gues whose sole job is to search for enemies .
a con@@ federal solution for pal@@ est@@ ine
lon@@ don – last month , while in new y@@ or@@ k city , i happened to be staying in the same hotel as isra@@ eli prime minister bin@@ y@@ amin net@@ any@@ ah@@ u .
to accommodate his security needs , the hotel had been converted into a fortress , much like isra@@ el itself .
net@@ any@@ ah@@ u was in the united states for yet another round of middle east peace talks .
the us offered various swe@@ eten@@ ers to in@@ duce isra@@ el to free@@ ze its west bank settlement construction for another 90 days .
the isra@@ eli@@ s refused ; another im@@ pas@@ se was reached .
what , then , might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land ?
the answer is : very poor .
all peace efforts since the os@@ lo acc@@ ords of 1993 have been based on the “ two-@@ state solution , ” according to which isra@@ el is supposed to turn over the occupied territories to a pal@@ est@@ inian state , the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans are supposed to ren@@ ounce any claims on the je@@ wish state , and everyone is supposed to live happ@@ ily ever after .
a negotiated “ land for peace ” solution still remains official western doc@@ tr@@ ine .
as us secret@@ ary of state h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton put it in a recent speech , “ a just , lasting , and comprehensive peace ” has to be based on “ two states for two peoples . ”
mean@@ while , the two main parties to the dispute , pal@@ est@@ ine and isra@@ el , are searching for unilateral alternatives to the sty@@ mi@@ ed “ peace process . ” the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans are pushing for international recognition of their stat@@ eh@@ ood , while the isra@@ eli@@ s are using their settlement policy to pre@@ emp@@ t a pal@@ est@@ inian state .
pal@@ est@@ inian president mah@@ m@@ oud ab@@ bas has said that , if the latest peace talks collapse , he will press for un recognition of a pal@@ est@@ inian state based on the 1967 borders .
this month , bra@@ zi@@ l and ar@@ gent@@ ina recognized “ pal@@ est@@ ine , ” and a cas@@ c@@ ade of l@@ atin ameri@@ can countries is expected to follow .
ab@@ bas is now setting his sights on europ@@ e , and would ask tur@@ key to serve as a go@@ -@@ between .
the game is to use international recognition of an independent pal@@ est@@ inian state to pressure the us to re@@ treat from its almost un@@ conditional support for isra@@ eli policy .
isra@@ el ’ s main concern continues to be security .
the official western doc@@ tr@@ ine is that isra@@ el ’ s long-term security depends on the success of the “ peace process . ”
in practice , isra@@ el has been taking other measures to secure its future .
media attention has been focused on the “ security wall , ” which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence .
but , to the ha@@ w@@ ks who now control isra@@ eli politics , the key to isra@@ el ’ s security depends on depth of defense , for which expansion of the settlements is indispensable .
the ha@@ w@@ ks ’ recip@@ e for survival is thre@@ e@@ fold : continued military and economic support from the us , defen@@ sible frontiers through a strategic settlement program , and the car@@ ve-@@ up of the pal@@ est@@ inian west bank into dis@@ connected ban@@ tu@@ st@@ ans , or sub@@ ordin@@ ate authorities , inc@@ ap@@ able of concer@@ ted opposition to isra@@ eli policy .
thus , while ab@@ bas seeks to create a new “ fact on the ground ” by dru@@ mming up international support for a pal@@ est@@ inian state , isra@@ el aims to tru@@ mp him by making such a state un@@ viable .
the ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states , but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single con@@ federal state .
indeed , the two-@@ state solution was always an illu@@ sion .
there was never enough land to satisfy the passion@@ ate poss@@ essi@@ veness of all those with claims to it .
and , over time , isra@@ eli sett@@ ler dis@@ engagement from the west bank and east jer@@ usalem has become just as impossible as any attempt by isra@@ el to exp@@ el its remaining arab@@ s .
isra@@ eli je@@ ws are bound to stay in the west bank and east jer@@ usalem , and isra@@ eli arab@@ s are bound to stay in isra@@ el proper .
these are the “ facts on the ground ” that do@@ om pal@@ est@@ inian hopes for a sovereign pal@@ est@@ inian state no less than isra@@ eli hopes for a wholly je@@ wish state .
moreover , land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view .
if compensation for wron@@ gs to the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans was to be the guiding principle , there were always better ways of going about it than to found a ri@@ ck@@ ety , pover@@ ty-@@ ri@@ dden new country dependent on foreign aid .
most people have forgotten that the par@@ is protocols of ap@@ ri@@ l 1994 established a customs union between isra@@ el and the occupied territories , with a joint economic council to adju@@ dic@@ ate trade disputes .
the free movement of goods , labor , and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to pal@@ est@@ inian g@@ d@@ p .
it could also have been the basis of a con@@ federal state , whose pal@@ est@@ inian part would have benefited from the west bank sett@@ lers ’ productivity and taxes .
but this ben@@ ign prospect was under@@ mined by the violence needed to maintain the je@@ wish state and enable the emergence of a pal@@ est@@ inian one .
the official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-@@ state settlement will bring about the security needed for the economic revi@@ val of the pal@@ est@@ inian territories .
but it is just possible that unilateral isra@@ eli policy , imp@@ lic@@ itly backed by the us , will create interim conditions of peace that are sufficient for economic growth to cool pal@@ est@@ inian nation@@ alism .
the pal@@ est@@ inian cause is not the over@@ riding pre@@ occupation of even the ar@@ ab states , so net@@ any@@ ah@@ u ’ s strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than ab@@ bas ’ s pursuit of stat@@ eh@@ ood through international recognition .
net@@ any@@ ah@@ u ’ s project is not moral .
but that doesn ’ t mean that it won ’ t work , at least for a time .
a con@@ federation for ko@@ so@@ vo
time is running out in ko@@ so@@ vo .
if a united n@@ ations@@ -@@ backed settlement is not reached by early dec@@ ember , the province ’ s majority alb@@ anian population is likely to declare independence unilater@@ ally – a move that the united states has announced it may support .
rus@@ sia would be fur@@ ious , because it fears that ko@@ so@@ vo ’ s sec@@ ession – whether or not it is internationally recognized – might fuel separ@@ ati@@ st movements in the former so@@ vi@@ et emp@@ ire .
ser@@ bia is even more strongly opposed .
d@@ us@@ an pr@@ or@@ o@@ ko@@ vic , ser@@ bia ’ s state secret@@ ary for ko@@ so@@ vo , has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty .
even if the government hes@@ it@@ ates , ul@@ tran@@ ation@@ alist groups might push prime minister vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v kost@@ unic@@ a to send in troops : the current un presence in ko@@ so@@ vo is very thin ( only 40 “ military observers ” and 2,@@ 1@@ 16 polic@@ emen ) but the station@@ ing of 15@@ ,000 nat@@ o troops could make any armed clas@@ h very dangerous .
after eight years of international administration , ko@@ so@@ vo ’ s alb@@ anian majority has ta@@ sted freedom and is e@@ ager for full independence .
but ser@@ bia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition .
moreover , independence would not be accepted by the ser@@ bian public , which has already wat@@ ched in dis@@ may as “ great ser@@ bia ” has been gradually wh@@ it@@ t@@ led away , most recently with the sec@@ ession of mon@@ tene@@ gro .
ser@@ bia is prepared to conc@@ ede only “ enhanced autonomy ” to ko@@ so@@ vo , and some capacity to enter into international agreements .
yet , while the two parties now seem irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , it is not too late for compromise .
but this is possible only by res@@ us@@ cit@@ ating – and updating – an old institution of the international community : a con@@ federation of states .
by means of a binding un security council resolution , ko@@ so@@ vo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory , as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene .
it could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals ( for example , admission and circulation of foreigners , or ex@@ tradition ) , plus the right to seek admission to the un ( which does not require full sovereignty and independence ) .
ko@@ so@@ vo would thus gain some essential tra@@ pp@@ ings of stat@@ eh@@ ood .
however , a decision-making body consisting of deleg@@ ates from ko@@ so@@ vo , ser@@ bia , and the europ@@ ean union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues ( for example , al@@ liances and relations with international economic institutions ) , defence , borders ( in case ko@@ so@@ vo wished to join with alb@@ ania ) , and the treatment of ko@@ so@@ vo ’ s ser@@ bian minority .
as a result , ko@@ so@@ vo and ser@@ bia would constitute two distinct international subjects , bound by a con@@ federation h@@ ing@@ ing on a common decision-making body .
of course , this con@@ federation would be asymmet@@ rical , because the ser@@ bian government ’ s sovereignty over the rest of ser@@ bia would remain int@@ act and unlimited , whereas the ko@@ so@@ var government ’ s “ sovereignty ” over ko@@ so@@ vo would be restra@@ ined .
to avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions , the common decision-making body should consist of four ser@@ bian deleg@@ ates , two ko@@ so@@ var deleg@@ ates , and three representatives of the eu , thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the europ@@ ean deleg@@ ates .
in addition , the eu should create a small but effective military force ( say , 5@@ ,000 troops ) to back up the common body ’ s decisions .
ser@@ bia would save face , and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning ko@@ so@@ vo , including the treatment of the ser@@ bian minority .
ko@@ so@@ vo would acquire limited independence , with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the un .
the eu would benefit as well , by contributing to the stabili@@ zation of a highly vol@@ atile area .
subsequently , the eu would monitor ko@@ so@@ vo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent .
a final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary .
histor@@ ically , con@@ feder@@ ations sooner or later either become feder@@ ations ( as occurred in the us , ger@@ many , and swit@@ zer@@ land ) or , pushed by cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gal forces , split up ( as with the united ar@@ ab re@@ public , established in 1958 , which split three years later into eg@@ yp@@ t and sy@@ ria ) .
the con@@ federation i advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage ( lasting five or ten years ) , at the end of which ko@@ so@@ vo is likely to become fully independent .
dela@@ ying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify ko@@ so@@ vo ’ s prospects of joining the eu and thus eventually sharing “ sovereign authority ” with other independent states , which could de@@ fl@@ ate ko@@ so@@ v@@ ars ’ danger@@ ously robust nation@@ alistic demands .
a conservative europ@@ e
last week ton@@ y bla@@ ir , j@@ acqu@@ es chi@@ rac , and ger@@ hard sch@@ ro@@ eder met in ber@@ lin .
we &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ ve heard that empty promise before .
instead , the europ@@ ean union needs a new direction .
i say this as leader of the party which has been at the fore@@ front of b@@ rit@@ ain &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s engagement with europ@@ e .
it was a conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s .
a conservative government took the united king@@ dom into the europ@@ ean economic community in 1973 .
mar@@ gare@@ t th@@ at@@ cher worked with j@@ acqu@@ es del@@ ors to for@@ ge the single market in 1986 .
so i have no doubt that b@@ rit@@ ain must remain influ@@ ential within the union .
but bri@@ tish policy towards the eu has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states .
faced with a new eu initiative , our traditional response has often been to oppose it , vote against it , lose the vote , then sul@@ k@@ ily to adopt it while bl@@ aming everyone else .
many europ@@ e@@ ans are si@@ ck of bri@@ tish vet@@ oes .
so am i .
of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept .
foremost are the four freedoms of the single market ; free movement of goods , services , people and capital .
but a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy , far less a common taxation policy .
forcing common standards means that europ@@ e will fall further behind as member states sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le their costs onto their neighbours .
which areas should be applied to every member state , and which should be optional ?
i believe that every member state should ad@@ minister those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states .
in areas which serve their national interest , individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co ‑ operate with others .
the union &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s members should form a series of overla@@ pping cir@@ cles : different combin@@ ations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing .
prece@@ dents exist for this .
nat@@ o has been flexible since its inc@@ eption .
fran@@ ce signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to nat@@ o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s central command .
similar flexibility exists with the euro , the schen@@ gen agreement , and the social chapter .
these prece@@ dents can be extended .
so far , everyone has had to move forward together , with individual countries negotiating specific opt ‑ outs .
but since 1998 , there has been a procedure within the treaties - called enhanced co ‑ operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member .
instead of individual member states having frau@@ ght negotiations to opt ‑ out of a new initiative , those that support it can simply opt ‑ in .
countries that want to integrate further can do so .
they don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t need to drag b@@ rit@@ ain and others ki@@ cking and scre@@ aming in their wake because the others are not comp@@ elled to join them .
in this way we can break free of the institution@@ alised tu@@ g of war that has characterised eu relations .
i am not talking about a two ‑ speed europ@@ e .
that implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey .
i don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t want to reach the destination that some of our partners may asp@@ ire to .
but i don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t want to block their way .
there are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely .
but influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end .
b@@ rit@@ ain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the euro are taken .
our economy has not been adver@@ sely affected by staying out .
keeping the po@@ und does not mean that we oppose the euro , or hope for its failure .
the europ@@ ean union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively .
it should give member states the chance to develop an approach to europ@@ e that suits their national traditions , within the eu framework .
it is on this basis that bri@@ tish con@@ servatives oppose the proposed constitution .
we disagree with many of its contents , of course , but also oppose the idea of having an eu constitution at all .
there is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty , and a single entity , whether you call it a state or not , with its own legal personality , deri@@ ving its authority from its own constitution .
if this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form , the eu would gain many attri@@ butes and tra@@ pp@@ ings of stat@@ eh@@ ood : its own president and foreign minister , its own legal system .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of eu law would deri@@ ve not from acts of national parliaments but from a su@@ pr@@ a ‑ national constitution .
that is a radical change , not the mere ti@@ dying ‑ up exercise some suggest .
i do not believe it is right to make a change of such mag@@ nit@@ ude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we go@@ vern .
elected parliaments do not own our liber@@ ties .
they safeguard them , and should not dimin@@ ish those liber@@ ties without an explicit mandate .
any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the bri@@ tish people and to the people in each eu member state .
a con@@ spi@@ racy so immense
new y@@ or@@ k – is this the age of the con@@ spi@@ racy theory ?
plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation , documentation , and in@@ ference that takes shape – usually on the internet – and spre@@ ads vir@@ ally around the globe .
in the process , con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories are pul@@ led from the margins of public dis@@ course , where they were generally con@@ signed in the past , and sometimes into the very heart of politics .
i learned this by accident .
having written a book about the hi@@ j@@ acking of executive power in the united states in the b@@ ush years , i found myself , in resear@@ ching new developments , stum@@ bling upon convers@@ ations online that embra@@ ce nar@@ rati@@ ves of behin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes manipulation .
there are some major themes .
a frequent one in the us is that global el@@ ites are plo@@ t@@ ting – via the bil@@ der@@ berg group and the council on foreign relations , among others – to establish a “ one world government ” dominated by themselves rather than national governments .
sometimes , more fol@@ kl@@ or@@ ic details come into play , bro@@ a@@ dening the members of this cab@@ al to include the ill@@ umin@@ ati , the fre@@ em@@ as@@ ons , r@@ ho@@ des schol@@ ars , or , as always , the je@@ ws .
the hall@@ marks of this nar@@ r@@ ative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis .
in liter@@ ary terms , this con@@ spi@@ racy theory closely resem@@ bles the protocols of the el@@ ders of zi@@ on , featuring secre@@ tive global elite with great power and wick@@ ed aims .
histor@@ ically , there tends to be the same set of themes : f@@ ear@@ some , un@@ controlled transform@@ ative change led by educated , ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zed cosm@@ opol@@ it@@ ans .
students of wei@@ mar ger@@ many know that sudden dis@@ locations and sho@@ cks – rapid ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation , dis@@ ruption of traditional family and social ties , loo@@ sen@@ ing of sexual restrictions , and economic collapse – pri@@ med many ger@@ mans to become recep@@ tive to simpl@@ istic the@@ ories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering .
simil@@ arly , the “ 9 / 11 truth movement ” asser@@ ts that al-@@ q@@ a@@ eda ’ s attack on the twin to@@ wers was an “ inside job . ”
in the mus@@ li@@ m world , there is a widespread con@@ spi@@ racy theory that the isra@@ eli@@ s were behind those attacks , and that all je@@ ws who worked in the buildings stayed home that day .
usually , con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories surface where people are po@@ or@@ ly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking .
so why are such the@@ ories gaining adher@@ ents in the us and other aff@@ lu@@ ent democracies nowadays ?
today ’ s explo@@ sion of con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories has been st@@ oked by the same conditions that dro@@ ve their acceptance in the past : rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty .
a clearly designated “ enemy ” with an un@@ mis@@ tak@@ able “ plan ” is psych@@ ologically more com@@ for@@ ting than the cha@@ o@@ tic evolution of social norms and the work@@ ings – or failures – of un@@ fet@@ tered capitalism .
and , while con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories are often pat@@ ently ir@@ rational , the questions they address are often healthy , even if the answers are frequently un@@ sour@@ ced or just plain wrong .
in seeking answers , these citizens are re@@ acting ration@@ ally to ir@@ rational realities .
many citizens believe , rightly , that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses .
newspapers in most advanced countries are strug@@ gling or fol@@ ding , and investig@@ ative reporting is often the first thing they cut .
concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular m@@ istr@@ ust , setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum .
likewise , in an age when corporate lob@@ by@@ ists have a free hand in shaping – if not drafting – public policies , many people believe , again rightly , that their elected officials no longer represent them .
hence their impul@@ se to believe in un@@ seen forces .
finally , even rational people have become more recep@@ tive to certain con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories because , in the last eight years , we actually have seen some sophisticated con@@ spi@@ racies .
the b@@ ush administration con@@ spi@@ red to lead ameri@@ cans and others into an illegal war , using fabri@@ c@@ ated evidence to do so .
is it any wonder , then , that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become un@@ usually op@@ a@@ que ?
when even the 9 / 11 commission@@ ers ren@@ ounce their own conclusions ( because they were based on evidence derived from torture ) , is it surprising that many want a second investigation ?
frequently enough , it is citizens dig@@ ging at the margins of the dis@@ course – pursuing such the@@ ories – who report on news that the main@@ stream media igno@@ res .
for example , it took a “ con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ist , ” al@@ ex j@@ ones , to turn up documentation of micro@@ wave technologies to be used by police forces on us citizens .
the new y@@ or@@ ker confirmed the story much later – without credi@@ ting the original source .
the main@@ stream media ’ s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually news@@ worthy in internet con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories partly reflects class bi@@ as .
con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories are seen as vul@@ gar and low@@ bro@@ w .
so even good , critical questions or well-@@ sour@@ ced data un@@ earth@@ ed by citizen investig@@ ators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists .
the real problem with this fran@@ tic con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ oriz@@ ing is that it leaves citizens emo@@ tionally ag@@ it@@ ated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their wor@@ ld@@ view , and without constructive directions in which to turn their emo@@ tions .
this is why so many th@@ reads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to h@@ ate speech and par@@ ano@@ ia .
in a fe@@ ver@@ ed environment , without good edi@@ torial vali@@ dation or tools for sourcing , citizens can be pre@@ yed upon and wh@@ i@@ pped up by de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues , as we saw in recent weeks at sar@@ ah pal@@ in ’ s r@@ allies after internet the@@ ories painted bar@@ ack ob@@ ama as a terrorist or in le@@ ague with terrorists .
citizens should be able more easily to lea@@ k information , pit@@ ch stories , and send leads to main@@ stream investig@@ ative re@@ por@@ ters .
they should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investig@@ ative reporting , un@@ medi@@ ated by corporate pressures .
and citizen investig@@ ators should be trained in basic journ@@ alism : finding good data , confir@@ ming stories with two independent sources , using quo@@ tes respon@@ sibly , and es@@ che@@ wing anony@@ m@@ ity – that is , standing by their own by@@ lines , as conventional re@@ por@@ ters do .
this is how citizens can be taken – and take themselves – seriously as docu@@ men@@ ters and investig@@ ators of our common situation .
in a time of official lies , healthy investig@@ ative energy should shed light , not just generate heat .
a constitutional coup in ukra@@ ine
changing constitu@@ tions is always a ris@@ ky business .
but it is a down@@ right dangerous one when undertaken to benefit one man alone .
indeed , when a president volunte@@ ers to reduce the powers of his own office , you can be certain that he is up to no good .
that is exactly what is going on in ukra@@ ine , where president le@@ on@@ id ku@@ ch@@ ma proposes to jun@@ k our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has con@@ co@@ c@@ ted .
ku@@ ch@@ ma has not suddenly converted to the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones .
no , ku@@ ch@@ ma wants to change ukra@@ ine &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s constitution for no other reason than to maintain his gri@@ p on power .
today , ku@@ ch@@ ma rules as an all-@@ powerful president .
but his term ends next year and he cannot run again .
so , instead of reti@@ ring gra@@ ce@@ fully , as presiden@@ ts from bill clin@@ ton to bor@@ is yel@@ ts@@ in rout@@ inely do , ku@@ ch@@ ma wants to change the constitution in order to become an all-@@ powerful prime minister who will never face a limit on the length of his term .
of course , constitu@@ tions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is ro@@ tten .
constitu@@ tions can , and should , accommodate reform when necessary .
a powerful president , however , is not necessarily wrong for ukra@@ ine .
in our w@@ ren@@ ching post@@ communist transition , it is essential that a government can act decisi@@ vely .
to change a system that seems best suited to ukra@@ ine &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s circumstances , you need a good reason .
the ukra@@ ine president is authorized to appoint and s@@ ack the prime minister , dis@@ solve parliament if he wishes , and rule by decre@@ e if he judges that the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s institutions are in danger .
he maintains day-to-day control over every aspect of government .
so pu@@ iss@@ ant a ca@@ es@@ ar must be above re@@ pro@@ ach .
as president , ku@@ ch@@ ma is gro@@ tes@@ qu@@ ely un@@ popular .
even slo@@ bo@@ dan mil@@ ose@@ vic had more support in y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via before his fall .
so ku@@ ch@@ ma knows that he cannot rely on hand@@ pi@@ cking his successor , as yel@@ ts@@ in did in rus@@ sia .
unable to assure himself of a t@@ ame presidential successor , ku@@ ch@@ ma wants what he calls a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; parliamentary re@@ public &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; with a weak president and powerful prime minister .
but the parliament he has in mind is a mut@@ ant , one where the author@@ itarian rule of the criminal c@@ lans ku@@ ch@@ ma controls will continue , unab@@ ated , behind the fac@@ ade of parliamentary procedure .
people too easily forget ukra@@ ine , this big country on the border of the so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be enlarged europ@@ ean union .
but any attempt to pro@@ long ku@@ ch@@ ma &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s rule will create such a political m@@ ess that it is not absurd to fear that ukra@@ ine could follow bel@@ ar@@ us and the bal@@ kan@@ s of the early 1990 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s into ou@@ tri@@ ght dictatorship and cha@@ os .
indeed , this scenario could wor@@ sen , because rus@@ sia is unlikely to sit around i@@ dly and watch ukra@@ ine un@@ ra@@ vel .
intervention of some type seems more likely in such circumstances .
only an imperi@@ al rus@@ sia , however , would d@@ are re@@ absor@@ b ukra@@ ine .
but an imperi@@ al rus@@ sia cannot be a democratic rus@@ sia .
so ku@@ ch@@ ma en@@ dangers freedom and human rights not only in ukra@@ ine , but ultimately threat@@ ens rus@@ sia &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s democracy as well .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , there has never been a better time for the west@@ --@@ particularly the eu@@ --@@ to nu@@ dge ukra@@ ine back from the br@@ ink .
with eu expansion coming next spring , all ukra@@ ini@@ ans fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the union &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s e@@ ast@@ ern@@ most border in pol@@ and .
although the job of maintaining ukra@@ ine &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s democracy is primarily one for ukra@@ ini@@ ans , the eu can help if it takes practical steps to re@@ assure ukra@@ ini@@ ans that they won &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t be cut off from the rest of europ@@ e .
a generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in ukra@@ ine that will benefit im@@ pover@@ ished eastern pol@@ and , are two possible in@@ duc@@ ements .
but these should be made conditional on ku@@ ch@@ ma leaving the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s constitution and democracy alone .
the eu should not fre@@ t about inter@@ fer@@ ing in ukra@@ ine &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s domestic affairs .
after all , it hes@@ it@@ ated little a few years ago to put a current member state , au@@ stri@@ a , on notice that it was watching out for the welfare of that country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s democracy .
the wa@@ y@@ ward ku@@ ch@@ ma is far more deser@@ ving of europ@@ e imposing safeguards to ensure his good behavior .
simil@@ arly , the us should cast a war@@ y eye at ku@@ ch@@ ma &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s decision to send troops to i@@ ra@@ q .
it cannot be the case that ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fi@@ del@@ ity to democracy in ukra@@ ine can be so cy@@ ni@@ cally purchased .
within ukra@@ ine , a government capable of truly governing should seek to adopt eu laws and norms in exactly the manner that the countries po@@ ised to join the union have done , thus helping to clean up the mur@@ ky system in which ku@@ ch@@ ma &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s criminal c@@ ron@@ ies flour@@ ish .
the constitution must be reformed , but not to shift power from one un@@ accountable leader to another .
what is needed are clear checks on arbitrary rule , and transparency in decision-making .
no one should doubt that ku@@ ch@@ ma intends to stay in power , no matter what .
less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election ( or any other kind of election ) if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued mis@@ rule .
it is , after all , president ku@@ ch@@ ma who is dis@@ credi@@ ted , not ukra@@ ine &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s constitutional arrangements .
a con@@ ta@@ gion of bad ideas
new y@@ or@@ k – the great recession of 2008 has mor@@ ph@@ ed into the north at@@ lan@@ tic recession : it is mainly europ@@ e and the united states , not the major emerging markets , that have become mi@@ red in slow growth and high unemployment .
and it is europ@@ e and ameri@@ ca that are mar@@ ching , alone and together , to the den@@ ou@@ ement of a grand deb@@ ac@@ le .
a bu@@ sted bub@@ ble led to a massive ke@@ yn@@ esian stimulus that aver@@ ted a much deeper recession , but that also fu@@ eled substantial budget deficits .
the response – massive spending cuts – ensures that un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably high levels of unemployment ( a vast waste of resources and an over@@ supply of suffering ) will continue , possibly for years .
the europ@@ ean union has finally committed itself to helping its financially dist@@ res@@ sed members .
it had no choice : with financial tur@@ mo@@ il threatening to spread from small countries like gre@@ ece and i@@ reland to large ones like ital@@ y and sp@@ ain , the euro ’ s very survival was in growing jeop@@ ar@@ dy .
europ@@ e ’ s leaders recognized that dist@@ res@@ sed countries ’ debts would become un@@ manage@@ able unless their economies could grow , and that growth could not be achieved without assistance .
but , even as europ@@ e ’ s leaders promised that help was on the way , they dou@@ bled down on the belief that non-@@ crisis countries must cut spending .
the resulting austerity will hin@@ der europ@@ e ’ s growth , and thus that of its most dist@@ res@@ sed economies : after all , nothing would help gre@@ ece more than robust growth in its trading partners .
and low growth will h@@ urt tax revenues , undermining the proc@@ laimed goal of fiscal consolidation .
the discussions before the crisis illustr@@ ated how little had been done to repair economic fundament@@ als .
the europ@@ ean central bank ’ s veh@@ ement opposition to what is essential to all capital@@ ist economies – the restructuring of failed or in@@ sol@@ vent entities ’ debt – is evidence of the continuing fra@@ gil@@ ity of the western banking system .
the ec@@ b argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for gre@@ ece ’ s bad sovereign debt , for fear that any priv@@ ate-@@ sector involvement ( p@@ si ) would trigger a “ credit event , ” which would force large pay@@ outs on credi@@ t-@@ default sw@@ aps ( c@@ d@@ ss ) , possibly fu@@ eling further financial tur@@ mo@@ il .
but , if that is a real fear for the ec@@ b – if it is not merely acting on behalf of private len@@ ders – surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital .
likewise , the ec@@ b should have bar@@ red banks from the ris@@ ky c@@ ds market , where they are held ho@@ stage to rat@@ ings agencies ’ decisions about what constitutes a “ credit event . ”
indeed , one positive achievement by europ@@ ean leaders at the recent br@@ ussel@@ s summit was to begin the process of re@@ ining in both the ec@@ b and the power of the ameri@@ can rat@@ ings agencies .
indeed , the most cur@@ ious aspect of the ec@@ b ’ s position was its threat not to accept re@@ structured government bonds as col@@ lateral if the rat@@ ings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event .
the whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remain@@ der more manage@@ able .
if the bonds were acceptable as col@@ lateral before the restructuring , surely they were safer after the restructuring , and thus equally acceptable .
this episode serves as a remin@@ der that central banks are political institutions , with a political agenda , and that independent central banks tend to be captured ( at least “ co@@ gni@@ tively ” ) by the banks that they are supposed to regulate .
and matters are little better on the other side of the at@@ lan@@ tic .
there , the extreme right threatened to shut down the us government , confir@@ ming what game theory suggests : when those who are ir@@ ration@@ ally committed to destruction if they don ’ t get their way confront rational individuals , the former prevail .
as a result , president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama acqui@@ es@@ ced in an un@@ balanced deb@@ t-@@ reduction strategy , with no tax increases – not even for the milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res who have done so well during the past two decades , and not even by eliminating tax gi@@ ve@@ a@@ ways to oil companies , which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degra@@ dation .
optim@@ ists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise ameri@@ ca ’ s debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited – roughly $ 25 billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year .
but the pay@@ roll@@ -@@ tax cut ( which put more than $ 100 billion into the po@@ ckets of ordinary ameri@@ cans ) was not renewed , and surely business , anticip@@ ating the contrac@@ tionary effects down the line , will be even more reluc@@ tant to lend .
the end of the stimulus itself is contrac@@ tionary .
and , with housing prices continuing to fall , g@@ d@@ p growth fal@@ tering , and unemployment remaining stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly high ( one of six ameri@@ cans who would like a full-@@ time job still cannot get one ) , more stimulus , not austerity , is needed – for the sake of balancing the budget as well .
the single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues , owing to poor economic performance ; the single best remedy would be to put ameri@@ ca back to work .
the recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction .
there has been much concern about financial con@@ ta@@ gion between europ@@ e and ameri@@ ca .
after all , ameri@@ ca ’ s financial mis@@ management played an important role in trig@@ gering europ@@ e ’ s problems , and financial tur@@ mo@@ il in europ@@ e would not be good for the us – especially given the fra@@ gil@@ ity of the us banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-@@ transparent c@@ d@@ ss .
but the real problem st@@ ems from another form of con@@ ta@@ gion : bad ideas move easily across borders , and mis@@ guided economic no@@ tions on both sides of the at@@ lan@@ tic have been reinforcing each other .
the same will be true of the stag@@ nation that those policies bring .
a cool calcul@@ us of global warming
the bri@@ tish government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming , and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions , in the hope of aver@@ ting some of the dire@@ st consequences .
written under the leadership of si@@ r ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ as stern of the lon@@ don school of economics , who succeeded me as chief econom@@ ist of the world bank , the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming , but whether we can afford not to .
the report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1 % of annual consumption , but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater .
the reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-@@ linear , with a non-@@ negli@@ gible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought .
indeed , the study may actually significantly under@@ estimate the costs : for instance , climate change may lead to more weather vari@@ ability , a possible dis@@ appearance or major shift of the g@@ ulf stream – of particular concern to europ@@ e – and a flour@@ ishing of disease .
when i served in 1995 on the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the scientific group that perio@@ di@@ cally ass@@ esses the science of global warming , there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased mark@@ edly since the beginning of the industrial revolution , that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases , and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels .
but few saw , for instance , the ar@@ tic ice cap mel@@ ting as rapidly as now seems to be the case .
still , some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be , we should do little or nothing .
to me , uncertainty should make us act more resol@@ utely today , not less .
as one scienti@@ st friend puts it : if you are driving on a mountain road , appro@@ aching a cli@@ ff , in a car whose bra@@ kes may fail , and a fo@@ g bank roll@@ s in , should you drive more or less cau@@ ti@@ ously ?
global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more f@@ ear@@ ful of what may be happening than the population at large .
as the stern report points out , as usual , the poor are the most vulnerable .
a third of b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h will be under@@ water by the end of this century .
the mal@@ di@@ ves and a host of p@@ aci@@ fic island states will disappear : our twenty-@@ first-@@ century at@@ lan@@ tis .
to an econom@@ ist , the problem is obvious : pollu@@ ters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause .
the advanced countries might mean b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h and the dis@@ appearing island states no harm , but no war could be more devastating .
a global extern@@ ality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate .
this does not mean an increase in overall taxation , but simply a sub@@ stitution in each country of a pollution ( carbon ) tax for some current taxes .
it makes much more sense to tax things that are bad , like pollution , than things that are good , like savings and work .
although president ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush says he believes in markets , in this case he has called for voluntary action .
but it makes far more sense to use the force of markets – the power of incentives – than to rely on goo@@ d@@ will , especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maxim@@ izing profits , regardless of the cost to others .
ex@@ x@@ on has re@@ porte@@ dly been funding so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming , just as the tobacco industry funded “ research ” to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer .
some companies even seem to celebrate the mel@@ ting of the pol@@ ar ice cap , because it will reduce the cost of extrac@@ ting the oil that lies bene@@ ath the ar@@ c@@ tic ocean .
the good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the my@@ ri@@ ad of subsidies for in@@ efficient us@@ ages .
the us subsidi@@ zes cor@@ n@@ -based ethan@@ ol , and im@@ poses tariffs on su@@ gar@@ -based ethan@@ ol ; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries .
most importantly , price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation .
small changes in practices , when rep@@ lic@@ ated by hundreds of millions of people , can make an enormous difference .
for example , simply changing the color of roo@@ fs in warm clim@@ ates to reflect sun@@ light or plan@@ ting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning .
we have but one planet , and should treas@@ ure it .
global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore .
a crisis in two nar@@ rati@@ ves
ch@@ ic@@ ago – with the world ’ s industrial democracies in crisis , two competing nar@@ rati@@ ves of its sources – and appropriate remedies – are emerging .
the first , bet@@ ter-@@ known diagnosis is that demand has collap@@ sed because of high debt accumul@@ ated prior to the crisis .
households ( and countries ) that were most pr@@ one to spend cannot bor@@ row any more .
to revi@@ ve growth , others must be encouraged to spend – governments that can still bor@@ row should run larger deficits , and ro@@ ck-@@ bottom interest rates should dis@@ courage thri@@ f@@ ty households from saving .
under these circumstances , budgetary reck@@ less@@ ness is a virtu@@ e , at least in the short term .
in the medium term , once growth revi@@ ves , debt can be paid down and the financial sector cur@@ bed so that it does not inf@@ lic@@ t another crisis on the world .
this nar@@ r@@ ative – the standard ke@@ yn@@ esian line , modified for a debt crisis – is the one to which most government officials , central ban@@ kers , and wall street economists have subscri@@ bed , and needs little elabor@@ ation .
its virtu@@ e is that it gives policymakers something clear to do , with promised returns that match the political cycle .
unfortunately , despite past stimulus , growth is still te@@ p@@ id , and it is increasingly difficult to find sensible new spending that can pay off in the short run .
attention is therefore shi@@ fting to the second nar@@ r@@ ative , which suggests that the advanced economies ’ fundamental capacity to grow by making useful things has been declining for decades , a trend that was mas@@ ked by deb@@ t-@@ fu@@ eled spending .
more such spending will not return these countries to a sustainable growth path .
instead , they must improve the environment for growth .
the second nar@@ r@@ ative starts with the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s , an era of rapid growth in the west and jap@@ an .
several factors , including post-@@ war reconstruction , the res@@ ur@@ gence of trade after the protection@@ ist 1930 ’ s , the introduction of new technologies in power , transport , and communications across countries , and expansion of educational at@@ tainment , underp@@ inn@@ ed the long boom .
but , as ty@@ ler co@@ wen has argued in his book the great stag@@ nation , once these “ low-@@ hang@@ ing fruit ” were p@@ lu@@ cked , it became much harder to prop@@ el growth from the 1970 ’ s on@@ ward .
mean@@ while , as wol@@ f@@ gang stre@@ eck writ@@ es persu@@ asi@@ vely in new left review , democratic governments , facing what seemed , in the 1960 ’ s , like an endless v@@ ista of innovation and growth , were quick to expand the welfare state .
but , when growth fal@@ tered , this meant that government spending expanded , even as its resources shr@@ ank .
for a while , central banks accommod@@ ated that spending .
the resulting high inflation created widespread dis@@ content , especially because little growth resulted .
faith in ke@@ yn@@ esian stimulus dimin@@ ished , though high inflation did reduce public-@@ debt levels .
central banks then began to focus on low and stable inflation as their primary objective , and became more independent from their political masters .
but deficit spending by governments continued ap@@ ace , and public debt as a share of g@@ d@@ p in industrial countries climb@@ ed steadily from the late 1970 ’ s , this time without inflation to reduce its real value .
recogni@@ zing the need to find new sources of growth , towards the end of j@@ im@@ my car@@ ter ’ s presidency , and then under ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an , the united states dereg@@ ul@@ ated industry and the financial sector , as did mar@@ gare@@ t th@@ at@@ cher in the united king@@ dom .
productivity growth increased substantially in these countries over time , which persu@@ aded continental europ@@ e to adopt reforms of its own , often pushed by the europ@@ ean commission .
yet even this growth was not enough , given previous governments ’ generous promises of health care and pensions – promises made even less ten@@ able by rising life expec@@ tan@@ cy and falling birth rates .
public debt continued to grow .
and the incomes of the moder@@ ately educated middle class failed to benefit from dereg@@ ul@@ ation-@@ led growth ( though it improved their lot as consumers ) .
the most recent phase of the advanced economies ’ f@@ ren@@ zi@@ ed search for growth took different forms .
in some countries , most notably the us , a priv@@ ate-@@ sector credit boom created jobs in low-@@ skilled industries like construction , and pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated a consumption boom as people borro@@ wed against over@@ valued houses .
in other countries , like gre@@ ece , as well as under regional administrations in ital@@ y and sp@@ ain , a govern@@ ment-@@ led h@@ iring spre@@ e created secure jobs for the moder@@ ately educated .
in this “ fundamental ” nar@@ r@@ ative , the advanced countries ’ pre-@@ crisis g@@ d@@ p was un@@ sustainable , bol@@ ster@@ ed by borro@@ wing and un@@ productive ma@@ ke-@@ work jobs .
more borro@@ wed growth – the ke@@ yn@@ esian formula – may create the illu@@ sion of nor@@ mal@@ cy , and may be useful in the immediate after@@ math of a deep crisis to calm a pan@@ ic , but it is no solution to a fundamental growth problem .
if this diagnosis is correct , advanced countries need to focus on revi@@ ving innovation and productivity growth over the medium term , and on real@@ ign@@ ing welfare promises with revenue capacity , while allevi@@ ating the pain of the truly des@@ ti@@ tu@@ te in the short run .
for example , southern europ@@ e ’ s growth potential may consist in dereg@@ ul@@ ating service sectors and reducing employment protection to sp@@ ur creation of more priv@@ ate-@@ sector jobs for re@@ tr@@ en@@ ched government workers and unemployed youth .
in the us , the imperative is to improve the match between potential jobs and worker skills .
people understand better than the government what they need and are acting accordingly .
many women , for example , are leaving low-@@ paying jobs to acquire skills that will open doors to hig@@ her@@ -@@ paying positions .
too little government attention has been focused on such issues , partly because pay@@ off@@ s occur beyond electoral horiz@@ ons , and partly because the effectiveness of government programs has been mixed .
tax reform , however , can provide sp@@ ur re@@ training and maintain incentives to work , even while fixing g@@ ap@@ ing fiscal holes .
three powerful forces , one hopes , will help to create more productive jobs in the future : better use of information and communications technology ( and new ways to make it pay ) , lower@@ -@@ cost energy as alternative sources are har@@ ness@@ ed , and sharp@@ ly rising demand in emerging markets for hig@@ her@@ -@@ valu@@ e-@@ added goods .
the advanced countries have a choice .
they can act as if all is well , except that their consumers are in a fun@@ k , and that “ animal spir@@ its ” must be revi@@ ved through stimulus .
or they can treat the crisis as a w@@ ak@@ e-@@ up call to fix what debt has pap@@ ered over in the last few decades .
for better or worse , the nar@@ r@@ ative that persu@@ ades these countries ’ governments and public@@ s will determine their future – and that of the global economy .
lon@@ don – public trust in financial institutions , and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them , was an early cas@@ u@@ alty of the financial crisis .
that is hardly surprising , as previously rever@@ ed firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed .
it is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this com@@ eu@@ pp@@ ance for the masters of the universe .
but , unfortunately , if this loss of trust pers@@ ists , it could be costly for us all .
as r@@ alp@@ h wal@@ do emer@@ son re@@ marked , “ our dist@@ r@@ ust is very expensive . ” the no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate kenn@@ eth ar@@ row made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago : “ it can be plau@@ sibly argued that much of the economic back@@ war@@ dness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence . ”
indeed , much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggreg@@ ate economic performance .
without mutual trust , economic activity is severely constra@@ ined .
even within europ@@ e , there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment , particularly through venture capital investment , and are prepared to use more flexible contracts , which are also beneficial for growth and investment .
so if it is true that trust in financial institutions – and in the governments that over@@ see them – has been damaged by the crisis , we should care a lot , and we should be de@@ vising responses which seek to re@@ build that trust .
in fact , the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpre@@ t .
in the united king@@ dom , recent survey results are ambiguous .
surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not dimin@@ ished much , and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the national health service or the b@@ b@@ c .
surveys promoted by the b@@ b@@ c tend to show the reverse .
banks quote statistics to show that they are more tru@@ sted than super@@ markets , whereas super@@ markets c@@ ite evidence that the opposite is true , and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks , which have had to be exp@@ en@@ sively ba@@ iled out by the government .
the market will prove one side right before too long .
in the united states , there is now a more systematic , independent survey promoted by economists at the university of ch@@ ic@@ ago booth school of business .
their financial trust index , based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-@@ makers in ameri@@ can households , did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009 , following the collapse of leh@@ man bro@@ thers .
that fall in confidence affected banks , the stock market , and the government and its regulators .
furthermore , the survey showed that declining trust was strongly cor@@ related with financial behavior .
in other words , if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharp@@ ly , you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks .
so falling trust had real economic consequences .
fortunately , the latest survey , published in ju@@ ly this year , shows that trust in banks and ban@@ kers has begun to recover , and quite sharp@@ ly .
this has been positive for the stock market .
there is also a little more confidence in the government ’ s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year .
the latter point , which no doubt reflects the ob@@ ama administration ’ s attempts to reform the d@@ ys@@ functional system it inher@@ ited , is particularly important , as the sharp@@ est dec@@ lines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government ’ s ability to regulate .
it would seem that re@@ building confidence in the federal reserve and the securities and exchange commission is economically more important than re@@ building trust in ci@@ ti@@ bank or a@@ ig .
continuing disputes in congress about the precise details of reform could , therefore , have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be over@@ hau@@ led gains ground .
all these data are at an aggreg@@ ate level and reflect average views among voters and investors .
yet we also know that individual views are remark@@ ably hetero@@ gen@@ eous .
some people are very tru@@ sting of others , and of the firms and institutions with which they do business .
others are con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally dist@@ ru@@ st@@ ful .
researchers at the europ@@ ean university institute in fl@@ or@@ ence and u@@ c@@ la recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals ’ income .
a pan@@ -@@ europ@@ ean opinion survey , which has been carried out for many years , allows us to relate the two .
it asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inc@@ lined to trust those with whom they deal .
the data show , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ingly , that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes .
it would seem not , as it is also true that very tru@@ sting people also have lower incomes than the average .
in other words , if you diver@@ ge mark@@ edly from society ’ s average level of trust , you are likely to lose out , either because you are so dist@@ ru@@ st@@ ful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange , or because you are so tru@@ sting that you leave yourself open to being che@@ ated and ab@@ used .
when anyone i don ’ t know says “ trust me ” – an ir@@ rit@@ ating convers@@ ational tic – i usually close my wal@@ let .
perhaps most academ@@ ics , who are at the lower end of the skill and quali@@ fic@@ ation-@@ adjusted income scale , do the same .
maybe we should trust each other more – but not too much .
new haven – few economists predic@@ ted the current economic crisis , and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes .
so , not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end , either .
of course , we all know the proxim@@ ate causes of an economic crisis : people are not spending , because their incomes have fallen , their jobs are in@@ secure , or both .
but we can take it a step further back : people ’ s income is lower and their jobs are in@@ secure because they were not spending a short time ago – and so on , back@@ wards in time , in a repe@@ ating feedback loo@@ p .
it is a vi@@ cious circle , but where and why did it start ?
why did it wor@@ sen ?
what will reverse it ?
it is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers .
the state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the great de@@ pression that followed the 19@@ 29 stock market crash .
economists did not pre@@ dict that event , either .
in the 19@@ 20 ’ s , some warned about an over@@ priced stock market , but they did not pre@@ dict a dec@@ ade@@ -@@ long de@@ pression affecting the entire economy .
the causes given were “ distributed widely among government , labor , industry , international politics and policies . ”
although economic theory today is much improved , if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis , we will mostly get the same answers . we would certainly hear some new ones , too : unprecedented real-@@ estate bub@@ bles , a global savings glu@@ t , international trade imbalances , exotic financial contracts , sub-@@ prime mort@@ g@@ ages , un@@ regulated over-@@ the-@@ counter markets , rating agencies ’ errors , com@@ promised real-@@ estate app@@ ra@@ is@@ als , and com@@ plac@@ ency about counter@@ party risk .
more likely than not , many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right , for the economic crisis was caused by a conf@@ lu@@ ence of many factors , the chance co-@@ occurr@@ ence of a lot of bad things , which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point .
at that point , the trouble gra@@ b@@ bed widespread attention , destroyed public confidence , and set in motion a negative feedback loo@@ p .
our attention , after all , is naturally drawn to the worst events . precisely because the worst events are statistical out@@ liers , their causes are probably multiple .
consider the question of predic@@ ting events like the jan@@ u@@ ary 2010 earthquake in ha@@ iti , which killed more than 200@@ ,000 people .
it captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage .
but if one went beyond trying to pre@@ dict the occurr@@ ence of earthqu@@ akes to predic@@ ting the extent of the damage , one could surely de@@ vise a long list of contributing factors – including even political , financial , and insurance factors – that resem@@ bles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis .
indeed , the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes . for , in a complicated economic system that fe@@ eds back on itself in many ways , events that start a vi@@ cious cycle might be as seem@@ ingly tri@@ vi@@ al as the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al but@@ ter@@ fly in the amaz@@ on , which , by fla@@ pping its w@@ ings , sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a far-@@ away hur@@ ri@@ cane .
cha@@ os theory in mathemati@@ cs explains such dependen@@ cy on remote and seem@@ ingly tri@@ vi@@ al initial conditions , and explains why even the extra@@ pol@@ ation of apparently precise plan@@ etary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future .
weather forec@@ ast@@ ers cannot forecast far into the future , either , but at least they have precise mathemati@@ cal models .
massive parallel computers are programm@@ ed to yield num@@ eri@@ cal solutions of differ@@ ential equ@@ ations derived from the theory of flu@@ id dynam@@ ics and ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics . scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather , even if it is inher@@ ently difficult to extra@@ pol@@ ate very far .
the problem for macro@@ economics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to system@@ ati@@ ze .
the mathemati@@ cal models that macro@@ economists have may resem@@ ble weather models in some respects , but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid , im@@ mut@@ able theory .
the most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis , car@@ men rein@@ hart ’ s and kenn@@ eth ro@@ go@@ ff ’ s this time is different , is essentially a summary of lessons learned from virtually every financial crisis in every country in recorded history .
but the book is almost entirely non-@@ theoretical .
it merely documents recurr@@ ent patterns .
unfortunately , in 800 years of financial history , there is only one example of a really massive worldwide contra@@ ction , namely the great de@@ pression of the 1930 ’ s .
so it is hard to know exactly what to expect in the current contra@@ ction based on the rein@@ har@@ t-@@ ro@@ go@@ ff analysis .
this leaves us trying to use patterns from past , dis@@ similar crises to try to in@@ fer the likely progno@@ sis for the current crisis .
as a result , we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or dis@@ appointing .
financing the next development agenda
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – as the 2015 target date for the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals approaches , the united nations is intensi@@ fying its efforts to foster debate about what comes next for promotion of development worldwide .
the outcome of these discussions will shape policies and investment aimed at sp@@ urr@@ ing g@@ d@@ p growth , strengthening human capital , and promoting more inclusive prosperity .
with the global population expected to reach nine billion people by 2050 – a significant proportion of whom will re@@ side in developing or under@@ developed countries – the international community must improve access to education , health care , and employment opportunities worldwide .
mean@@ while , the prospect of a rise in global temperature of more than 2 ° c ( 3.@@ 6 ° f ) over pre-@@ industrial levels by the end of this century ( which would trigger global warming ’ s most damaging effects ) calls for higher investment in sustainable ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation , cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ smart agriculture , and social safety nets .
governments , civil society , and the private sector must rise to the challenge , cooperating to find and implement creative solutions .
but , first , they must anticip@@ ate the associated financing requirements , which will soon sur@@ pass the current capacities of governments and international donors , and take action now to activate new , reliable sources of financing .
to start , governments should design targeted , evi@@ den@@ ce-@@ based policies and support the development of sound institutions .
this would make government services more effective , while helping to cataly@@ ze additional development aid from traditional donors and mobili@@ ze priv@@ ate-@@ sector resources .
in many countries , there is considerable scope for domestic resource mobili@@ zation .
bro@@ a@@ dening the tax base , improving tax administration , and closing gaps in the valu@@ e-@@ added tax could make a significant difference in lower@@ -@@ income countries , where tax revenues account for only about 10-@@ 14 % of g@@ d@@ p , compared to 20-@@ 30 % of g@@ d@@ p in high-@@ income countries .
more equ@@ itable taxation would have a positive impact on governance , another important tool for mobi@@ liz@@ ing domestic resources .
with improved corporate and public governance and clear transfer@@ -@@ pricing policies , re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ rich countries could shore up their capacity to negotiate fair contracts with extrac@@ tive industries , balance revenues and expendi@@ tures over time , and manage their natural en@@ dow@@ ments more transpar@@ ently .
progress in these areas would help governments to channel their spending more effectively toward those who would benefit the most .
for example , only 8 % of the $ 4@@ 09 billion spent on fossi@@ l-@@ fuel subsidies in 2010 reached the poorest 20 % of the population .
a targeted support program could increase substantially the efficiency of spending , fre@@ eing up resources for education , health , and poverty eradication .
furthermore , promoting financial deepening and inclu@@ si@@ veness could accelerate priv@@ ate-@@ sector growth , creating more opportunities .
indeed , broader access to financial services would help the estimated 400 million m@@ icro , small , and medium-@@ size enterprises in developing countries to prosp@@ er , while enabling the 2.5 billion people worldwide who currently lack access to such services to build their assets .
a deeper and more efficient financial sector would also reduce transaction costs and facilitate risk management .
loc@@ al-@@ currency bond markets could help to develop domestic investor bases and mobili@@ ze domestic savings to support long-term investments .
at the same time , the international community should work to improve the availability and effectiveness of official development assistance .
the o@@ da target of 0.@@ 7 % of g@@ d@@ p – agreed in 2002 at the international conference on financing for development in mon@@ ter@@ rey , m@@ ex@@ ico – should motiv@@ ate countries to increase their contributions .
they can also take steps to make o@@ da more predictable from year to year .
donors should structure aid to ensure that it supports sound national development policies and programs , rather than their own narrow interests .
this is particularly relevant as emerging development partners , especially the bri@@ cs ( bra@@ zi@@ l , rus@@ sia , indi@@ a , ch@@ ina , and south afri@@ ca ) , offer new kinds of aid packages that incorporate investment and non-@@ financial assistance .
private ch@@ arities , which have been instru@@ mental in promoting innovation in fields such as health care , the environment , and education , could provide valuable insight into chann@@ eling aid more effectively .
more generally , improving coordination among donors would help to maxim@@ ize the impact of aid on the ground .
while o@@ da remains an important source of financing for fragile and ver@@ y-@@ low-@@ income countries , it represents only 7 % of net financial flows to developing countries , where foreign direct investment , re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces , long-term debt , and portfolio investment have a larger impact .
donors should leverage aid to “ grow the p@@ ie ” and to diversi@@ fy financing sources for the world ’ s poorest countries by providing risk guarantees , innovative investment vehicles , debt syn@@ dic@@ ation , and co-@@ financing arrangements .
attrac@@ ting even a fra@@ ction of the assets held by institutional investors , sovereign@@ -@@ wealth funds , and public pension funds could boost development finance substantially .
di@@ as@@ por@@ a populations are another major potential source of development financing .
reducing transfer costs , which average an estimated 9 % of the value of transactions , would put more money into the hands of those who need it most .
tail@@ oring financial products for di@@ as@@ por@@ a communities could attract resources for investment , while reinforcing migrants ’ ties – economic and otherwise – to their home countries .
finally , the international community bears a special responsibility for delivering global public goods .
the responsibility to preserve the environment , stem the spread of communic@@ able diseases , strengthen the international financial architecture , enhance develop@@ ing-@@ country participation in the global trading system , and facilitate the exchange of knowledge lies at the inter@@ section of national development priorities and global interests .
dut@@ y-@@ free , quo@@ ta-@@ free access to o@@ ec@@ d markets , comple@@ mented by simpler , more transparent rules of origin , would raise g@@ d@@ p by 1 % in the le@@ ast-@@ developed countries , lifting millions out of poverty .
investment in statistical capacity would help governments and businesses worldwide to make better policy decisions , based on a more accurate accounting of the associated costs and benefits .
the challenge of the post-@@ 2015 development agenda lies in finding creative solutions to support prosperity , equality , and sustainability .
together , governments , civil society , international organizations , and the private sector can improve the availability and quality of finance for development , and shape a better future for all .
a cure for fiscal failure ?
cam@@ bridge – should more countries create independent fiscal advisory coun@@ cils to inf@@ use greater objec@@ tivity into national budget debates ?
j@@ ailed s@@ win@@ dler ber@@ nie ma@@ do@@ ff recently summ@@ ed up a lot of people ’ s feelings about fiscal policy , declar@@ ing that “ the whole government is a pon@@ zi scheme . ”
perhaps this was just w@@ ish@@ ful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record@@ -@@ breaking $ 50 billion py@@ ra@@ mid scheme collap@@ sed in 2008 .
personally , i suspect ma@@ do@@ ff ’ s un@@ en@@ viable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while .
still , with many of the world ’ s largest governments facing a le@@ th@@ al combination of un@@ sustainable conventional debt , unprecedented ol@@ d-@@ age pension obligations , and a down@@ shift in growth , one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is .
in a new paper , “ a decade of debt , ” car@@ men m. rein@@ hart and i show that general government debt in the united states , including federal , state , and local debt , has now sur@@ passed the record 120 % of g@@ d@@ p reached at the end of world war ii .
jap@@ an , of course , is in even worse shape , with government debt total@@ ing more than 200 % of g@@ d@@ p .
though this is partially offset by foreign@@ -@@ exchange reserves , jap@@ an now faces massive disast@@ er-@@ relief costs – and this on top of its de@@ pressing demographic trends .
many other rich countries ’ debt levels are also un@@ comfortably close to 15@@ 0-@@ year high@@ s , despite relative peace in much of the world .
there is a no easy way out .
for now , low world interest rates are restra@@ ining deb@@ t-@@ service costs , but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods , whereas real ( infl@@ ation-@@ adjusted ) interest rates can rise far more quickly , even for rich countries .
debt crises tend to come out of the blue , hit@@ ting countries whose debt tra@@ jec@@ tories simply have no room for error or un@@ planned ad@@ versity .
the single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to re@@ ign in spending by producing a counter@@ point to p@@ ang@@ los@@ sian government growth and revenue forecasts .
in principle , an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-@@ balance sheet debts .
it is high time to consider novel approaches .
of course , no one simple change will eliminate the huge bi@@ as towards deficit spending in most modern political systems .
and no one simple change will prec@@ lu@@ de the risk of future debt and inflation crises .
many countries require swe@@ eping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entit@@ lement programs – including their pension schemes – more realistic .
the recent adv@@ ent of fiscal advisory coun@@ cils is a promising institutional start .
a number of countries , including den@@ mark , the ne@@ ther@@ lands , the us , and bel@@ gi@@ um , have long-@@ standing fiscal wat@@ ch@@ dog agencies , such as the us con@@ gres@@ sional budget office ( c@@ bo ) .
but , while these older institutions have proven enor@@ m@@ ously useful , they are typically quite constra@@ ined .
the c@@ bo , for example , is free to issue long-term fiscal projec@@ tions based on its own best estimates of growth , but is largely forced to accept politically im@@ plau@@ sible future “ fi@@ xes ” at face value , somewhat neutr@@ alizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies .
to enhance credibility , a number of governments are g@@ ing@@ erly moving towards creating fiscal coun@@ cils with greater independence , often with central banks as a role model .
the new van@@ guard includes coun@@ cils in s@@ weden , the united king@@ dom , slo@@ ven@@ ia , and can@@ ada .
the remit of s@@ weden ’ s fiscal council is particularly broad , giving it a mandate not only to forecast , but also to look more deeply at the motiv@@ ations and consequences of government policy .
in principle , an independent fiscal council could have provided inv@@ al@@ u@@ able help during the financial crisis .
in the us , such an agency could have weigh@@ ed in on the costs and benefits of ba@@ il@@ out plans , perhaps helping to end con@@ gres@@ sional par@@ aly@@ sis and ste@@ eling ner@@ ves to give taxpayers more up@@ side risk .
it is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks , at least any@@ time soon .
there is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy .
and fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-@@ dimensional .
still , the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal san@@ ity .
of course , fiscal coun@@ cils by themselves are not enough , no matter how well designed they are .
to resist these powerful pressures , fiscal coun@@ cils will need to have their work audi@@ ted perio@@ di@@ cally by international agencies such as the international monetary fund , both to protect their independence and to promote accountability .
to be sure , ber@@ nie ma@@ do@@ ff may yet be proved right , and his will not turn out to be the biggest pon@@ zi scheme ever .
but greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpet@@ ual con@@ und@@ rum of out@@ sized deficits .
it is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather bar@@ ren policy landscape .
a customs union for the bal@@ kan@@ s
the fall of mil@@ ose@@ vic does not cure the political wo@@ es of the bal@@ kan@@ s ; indeed , it raises their urgency .
y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via has dis@@ integrated , but the dis@@ integration is incomplete .
it was in y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via that vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v kost@@ unic@@ a was elected president , but his mandate comes solely from support in ser@@ bia .
mon@@ tene@@ gro , ser@@ bia ’ s j@@ unior partner in the y@@ u@@ gosla@@ v federation , mostly boy@@ cot@@ ted the election while alb@@ ani@@ ans in ko@@ so@@ vo ignored them .
yet it was y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via , whose foundations are unstable , that was recently admitted to the un .
a host of problems remain un@@ resolved : relations between ser@@ bia and mon@@ tene@@ gro and the status of ko@@ so@@ vo ( not to mention ser@@ bia ’ s northern province of vo@@ j@@ vo@@ d@@ ina ) .
any resolution – any suggestion of change – will en@@ gender new conflicts because of conflic@@ ting claims of sovereignty .
however temp@@ ting it may be to solve the pu@@ zz@@ le by drawing new borders or establishing new entities , this con@@ und@@ rum cannot be resolved in terms of sovereignty .
that traditional solution would only perpet@@ u@@ ate the problems of the bal@@ kan@@ s .
a new approach is needed : the europ@@ ean union should use the prospect of europ@@ ean integration as the way to promote regional integration .
the eu could act as a mag@@ net to bring the region closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to europ@@ e .
this idea has great appeal to people in the region , but only the eu can make it happen .
after nat@@ o intervention in ko@@ so@@ vo , europ@@ ean leaders made this approach the corner@@ stone of their vision for the bal@@ kan@@ s .
it was enshrined in the stability pact signed at the sar@@ aje@@ vo summit of ju@@ ly , 1999 .
but the stability pact is merely a shell – it needs to be filled with content .
the time to do so is at the z@@ agre@@ b conference on nov@@ ember 24 called by fran@@ ce as the current eu president .
the europ@@ ean union should now propose a three-@@ point plan for the bal@@ kan@@ s :
$ a customs union with preferential access to eu markets within one year . the existing eu@@ -@@ tur@@ key customs union should be used as a model .
once all these countries reach agreement with the eu there would automatically be free trade throughout the bal@@ kan@@ s .
this will take some time to implement .
but from the start , the eu should give a signal by unilater@@ ally opening its border to imports from the region .
this cannot en@@ danger any eu interests as the countries at issue now have far less than 1 % of the eu market .
$ a regional v@@ at to replace the lost customs revenues should be established within two years .
differences in indirect taxes such as v@@ at pose another way in which borders become obstacles to trade .
they should be unified throughout the region .
regional v@@ at rates might be increased slightly if expenditure restra@@ int is not sufficient to offset the loss of tariff revenues due to the customs union .
$ temporary budgetary support on a declining scale for three years , subject to eu supervision over budgetary expendi@@ tures .
because it will take time to collect revenues from the regional v@@ at , the eu should provide financial help during the transition .
the area covered by this plan would include bul@@ g@@ aria , cro@@ ati@@ a and alb@@ ania as well as ser@@ bia , bo@@ s@@ nia , mac@@ ed@@ onia , mon@@ tene@@ gro and ko@@ so@@ vo .
participation by roman@@ ia and mol@@ do@@ va is optional .
bul@@ g@@ aria and cro@@ ati@@ a could be persu@@ aded to participate provided it would not inter@@ fere with their candi@@ d@@ acy for eu membership .
depending on the country , there could be more or less budgetary support .
( bul@@ g@@ aria , for example , might not need compensation since to a great extent it has already eliminated tariffs ) .
in comparison to the cost of military intervention and peac@@ eke@@ eping , the financial costs here are ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously low .
i estimate that euro 750 million in the first year , euro 500 million in the second year and euro 250 million in the third year would do the tri@@ ck .
( if roman@@ ia and mol@@ do@@ va were included the figures would be slightly higher ) .
these figures are well within range of ple@@ dges already made by the eu for the stability pact and they could be easily accommod@@ ated within the con@@ fines of the ber@@ lin acc@@ ord on the eu budget for 2000-@@ 2005 if eu member states agree to a real@@ location of un@@ spent funds .
budgetary support in the context of a customs union would be a more effective way to dis@@ bur@@ se eu funds than conventional methods .
this three-@@ point program would lay the ground for economic res@@ ur@@ gence .
it would remove two major sources of corruption and in@@ efficiency : the customs service and the mis@@ use of public funds in general .
it would create a trade area large enough to generate both local and foreign investment .
the deutsche mark , already widely used in the region , now functions as the de facto common currency .
any ban on its use should be li@@ fted to make borders ir@@ relevant for trade and investment .
improved economic prospects and the strengthening of institutions , in turn , would have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the bal@@ kan@@ s .
ser@@ bia has climb@@ ed part of the way out of the ab@@ y@@ ss .
success in peac@@ efully removing a ty@@ rant has set in motion a process of national renewal .
but that process has a long way to go .
the opposition inher@@ ited a bank@@ rupt country whose institutions are in ruins .
the population , frustr@@ ated by ever deepening im@@ pover@@ ishment and isolation , is beginning to question what happened over the past decade in ser@@ bia .
people are asking about crimes committed by the mil@@ ose@@ vic regime against ser@@ bs .
they must begin to come to terms with the crimes committed against others - in cro@@ ati@@ a , bo@@ s@@ nia and ko@@ so@@ vo .
once that process is underway , many problems that now seem in@@ trac@@ table will be resolved more easily .
kost@@ unic@@ a ’ s election as president of y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via amounts to an incomplete revolution : many of the old guard are still in place .
the momentum created by mil@@ ose@@ vic ’ s over@@ throw needs to be maintained .
mil@@ ose@@ vic was over@@ thrown in the hope of ending ser@@ bia ’ s isolation . europ@@ e must now ful@@ fill its promise .
if the f@@ ren@@ ch presidency fails to sei@@ ze the moment in z@@ agre@@ b , an historic opportunity will be lost .
a cz@@ ech moment
the reality is that there is no such thing as “ old and new ” europ@@ e , and there never was .
the break with commun@@ ism and re@@ unification of europ@@ e is now almost two decades old .
we cz@@ ech@@ s are 100 % europ@@ ean , and were even when the iron cur@@ tain cut us off from democratic europ@@ e .
indeed , our pro-@@ eu senti@@ ments may be all the stronger because our membership in the union , like our freedom , is so compar@@ atively new .
so no one in europ@@ e needs to fear that the cz@@ ech re@@ public has some no@@ stal@@ gic or i@@ di@@ os@@ yn@@ c@@ ratic agenda that it wants to impose on the union .
on the contrary , events have imposed an agenda on europ@@ e that we cannot escape and for which solidarity – true union – will be needed .
the primary , and most pressing , of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is envelop@@ ing the eu .
unfortunately , conditions across the union will likely wor@@ sen before they begin to improve .
the type of social un@@ rest recently witnessed in gre@@ ece may spread , because the down@@ turn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on europ@@ e ’ s young people , who are seeking jobs at a time when har@@ d-@@ pressed europ@@ ean businesses will be able to offer them very few .
it will fall to the union , once again , to help transform des@@ pair into hope .
we cz@@ ech@@ s know something about this , as the w@@ ren@@ ching economic transition that we under@@ went in the 1990 ’ s taught us much about how the right policies can break the gri@@ p of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
to contain today ’ s financial and economic crisis , europ@@ e will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point .
the very existence of our union , and particularly of the euro , has already helped to prevent the competitive de@@ valu@@ ations and beg@@ gar@@ -@@ th@@ y-@@ neigh@@ bor policies that ra@@ v@@ aged europ@@ e during the 1930 ’ s – the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic down@@ turn .
but we cannot be com@@ plac@@ ent that the forces of national ego@@ ism will remain in check .
for now , eu governments ’ coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived popul@@ ists of their usual charge that the eu is in@@ different to the fate of individuals .
even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-@@ establish eu norms once the storm cl@@ ou@@ ds begin to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate .
although it is right that the stability and growth pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times , its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro .
these rules must eventually be restored int@@ act if europ@@ e is to return to the path of sustainable growth , and a consensus will need to be for@@ ged now to make that happen .
the second key challenge that we will face during our europ@@ ean presidency is that of rus@@ sia .
a new partnership and cooperation agreement ( p@@ ca ) between the eu and the rus@@ sian federation must be negotiated .
those negotiations should have begun seriously last year , but the war in ge@@ or@@ gia interven@@ ed to put them on hold .
now those talks have resumed , but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically .
rus@@ sia ’ s economy is now in far worse shape than that of eu members .
the collapse of world oil and gas prices has wo@@ unded rus@@ sia ’ s budget , and lack of investment in the country ’ s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predic@@ ted .
until now , rus@@ sia has c@@ ared less about a new p@@ ca than the eu , because two-@@ thirds of rus@@ sia ’ s exports to the union comp@@ rise natural resources , which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a p@@ ca provides .
given the stark changes in economic conditions , however , it is now in rus@@ sia ’ s national interest to re@@ assure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business , for which a new p@@ ca would serve as an ideal signal .
moreover , without a new p@@ ca , individual europ@@ ean countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with rus@@ sia .
indeed , many eu members have been in a race with each other to see who will be rus@@ sia ’ s closest friend in the union .
but the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other union members , and may un@@ balance relations within the union as a whole . only a rul@@ es-@@ based eu framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and uni@@ on-@@ wide relations with rus@@ sia .
europ@@ e ’ s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rul@@ es-@@ based multilater@@ alism , important as that undoubtedly is , but its unity .
when the ge@@ or@@ gia crisis erup@@ ted , europ@@ e united around a single position on rus@@ sia ’ s withdrawal .
it is the cz@@ ech re@@ public ’ s task , and that of the swe@@ dish eu presidency that will follow our own , to maintain this unity as the p@@ ca negotiations move forward .
during the 1990 ’ s , the us and europ@@ e er@@ red in treating rus@@ sia with ben@@ ign neg@@ le@@ ct . it would be a mistake for rus@@ sia to respond in kind today by seeking to pro@@ long the p@@ ca negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amen@@ able eu president may one day offer so@@ fter terms .
we , like all eu presiden@@ cies , will be representing the wider union interests when we negotiate .
the rus@@ sian go@@ d@@ father
war@@ saw – rus@@ sian president v@@ ladimir pu@@ tin is be@@ having like a ma@@ fia bo@@ ss .
in inv@@ ading , occup@@ ying , and finally anne@@ x@@ ing cri@@ me@@ a , he pointed rus@@ sia ’ s g@@ uns at ukra@@ ine and said : your territorial sovereignty or your life .
so far , ex@@ tor@@ tion has worked – and pu@@ tin knows it .
indeed , in his speech announ@@ cing the anne@@ x@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a , pu@@ tin spoke his mind : his regime fears no punishment and will do whatever it ple@@ ases .
cri@@ me@@ a is just the first step toward re@@ alizing his dream of revi@@ ved rus@@ sian great@@ ness .
his address in the kre@@ m@@ lin was a tissue of lies and manipulation , though a sub@@ tle analysis would be a waste of time .
the simple fact is that the president of one of the world ’ s most powerful countries has embark@@ ed on a path of confron@@ tation with the entire international community .
his speech sm@@ acked of the fe@@ ver@@ ed , par@@ ano@@ id world of f@@ yo@@ dor do@@ sto@@ ye@@ v@@ sky ’ s demon@@ s , con@@ j@@ uring as it did a del@@ u@@ sional alternative universe – a place that does not exist and has never existed .
what does ko@@ so@@ vo , where the alb@@ ani@@ ans suffered persecution and ethnic clean@@ sing , have in common with the situation in cri@@ me@@ a , whose people have never been op@@ pressed by ukra@@ ini@@ ans ?
what is the point in dis@@ playing open con@@ temp@@ t for ukra@@ ine ’ s government , parliament , and people ?
why label ukra@@ inian authorities “ fasc@@ ist and anti-@@ semi@@ tic ” ?
cri@@ mean tat@@ ars pay no he@@ ed to the fair@@ y tal@@ es about fasc@@ ists ruling ukra@@ ine ; they can still remember the brutal and mur@@ der@@ ous mass de@@ port@@ ations of their parents and grand@@ parents , ordered by stal@@ in and carried out by the n@@ k@@ v@@ d .
in pu@@ tin ’ s mind , the whole world has discrimin@@ ated against rus@@ sia for the last three centuries .
rus@@ sia ’ s bloo@@ dy des@@ pots – ca@@ therine ii , ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ as i , or stal@@ in – apparently never discrimin@@ ated against anyone .
rus@@ sia could not , according to pu@@ tin , leave the people of cri@@ me@@ a “ alone in their pre@@ di@@ ca@@ ment . ” these words prompt a sad s@@ mile ; le@@ on@@ id bre@@ zh@@ ne@@ v used precisely the same phrase in aug@@ ust 1968 to justify the red army ’ s intervention in cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia to help bele@@ agu@@ ered communist hard@@ lin@@ ers there cr@@ ush the pra@@ gue spring reform movement .
“ we want ukra@@ ine to be a strong , sovereign , and independent country , ” says pu@@ tin .
stal@@ in said the same thing about pol@@ and in 1945 .
bra@@ ve rus@@ sian democ@@ rats who have not yet been si@@ len@@ ced have already re@@ marked on the simil@@ arity between pu@@ tin ’ s appeal to ethnic solidarity in anne@@ x@@ ing cri@@ me@@ a and hit@@ ler ’ s stance during the anschluss and the su@@ deten crisis in 19@@ 38 .
this is the real end of history – the history of dreams about a world governed by democratic values and the market economy .
unless the democratic world under@@ stands that now is not the time for faith in diplomatic compromise , and that it must respond strongly enough to stop pu@@ tin ’ s imperi@@ al designs , events could follow a logic that is too d@@ read@@ ful to con@@ template .
it takes force to stop a thu@@ g , not sharp words or cosme@@ tic sanctions .
i commend and take pride in pol@@ and ’ s pru@@ dent and determined policy and the attitude of its public , which do us great credit .
but we must recognize that the best quar@@ ter-@@ century in the last 400 years of pol@@ ish history is about to end before our very eyes .
a time of tec@@ ton@@ ic shi@@ fts has begun .
we must appreciate what we have managed to achieve – and learn to protect it .
ma@@ fia bo@@ ss@@ es often meet an un@@ happy fate , and i do not think that pu@@ tin will fare much better in the end .
unfortunately , many people are likely to be h@@ urt in the meantime , not least those who now support him .
living with climate change
ro@@ tter@@ dam – for anyone still un@@ decided about the consequences of global warming , the summer of 201@@ 8 , one of the ho@@ tt@@ est on record , should have ti@@ pped the sc@@ ales .
across far-@@ f@@ lung long@@ itu@@ des and l@@ ati@@ tudes , regions are strug@@ gling with the fall@@ out from large-scale cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ related events .
in the southern united states , cities and towns pum@@ mel@@ ed by hur@@ ri@@ cane fl@@ or@@ ence in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber were still dr@@ ying out when hur@@ ri@@ cane mi@@ cha@@ el brought more floo@@ ding in oc@@ tober .
in c@@ alifor@@ nia , fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters are batt@@ ling the embers of the largest wild@@ fire in state history .
and in parts of l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , europ@@ e , afri@@ ca , and a@@ sia , agricultural output is in fre@@ ef@@ all following months of sti@@ fl@@ ing heat .
cool@@ er weather has done little to ease the suffering .
according to the national oc@@ e@@ an@@ ic and atmosp@@ h@@ eric administration , “ moderate ” to “ exceptional ” d@@ rought conditions cover 25.@@ 1 % of the united states .
but “ extreme ” and “ exceptional ” d@@ rought – the worst categories – expanded to cover 6.@@ 3 % of the country , up from 6 % in mid-@@ se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber .
regions in au@@ str@@ alia also are strug@@ gling with the worst d@@ rought in a generation .
in fact , for a growing number of people around the world , floods , lands@@ li@@ des , and he@@ at@@ waves – jap@@ an ’ s summer in a nut@@ shell – is the new normal .
a recent study in the journ@@ al p@@ los medicine projects a fi@@ ve@@ fold increase in he@@ at-@@ related deaths in the us by 20@@ 80 ; the outlook for poorer countries is even worse .
the climate debate is no longer about causes ; fossil fuels and human activity are the cul@@ pr@@ its .
rather , the question is how billions of at-@@ risk people and businesses can rapidly adapt and ensure their communities are as re@@ sili@@ ent as possible .
even if the world meets the par@@ is climate agreement ’ s target of limiting the increase in global temperature to 2@@ º cel@@ si@@ us relative to pre-@@ industrial levels , adaptation will still be critical , because climate extre@@ mes are now the new normal .
some communities have already recognized this , and local adaptation is well under way .
in mel@@ bour@@ ne , au@@ str@@ alia , for example , plann@@ ers are working to double the city ’ s tree can@@ op@@ y by 20@@ 40 , an approach that will lower temperatures and reduce he@@ at-@@ related deaths .
simil@@ arly , in ah@@ me@@ d@@ ab@@ ad , a city of over seven million people in western indi@@ a , authorities have launched a major initiative to cover roo@@ fs in reflec@@ tive paint to lower temperatures on “ heat islands , ” urban areas that tra@@ p the sun ’ s warm@@ th and make city living unbe@@ ar@@ able , even at night .
these are just two of the many infra@@ structural responses that communities around the world have undertaken .
but adapting to climate change will also mean managing the long-term economic fall@@ out of extreme weather , and this is a requirement that countries are only beginning to take seriously .
consider water scar@@ city .
according to a 2016 world bank analysis , d@@ rou@@ ght-@@ related water crises in afri@@ ca and the middle east could reduce g@@ d@@ p in these regions by as much as 6 % by 2050 .
that would be painful anywhere , but it would be devastating in regions already ri@@ fe with political tur@@ mo@@ il and humanitarian crises .
the decline in property values will have far-reaching implications not only for individual wealth , but also for the tax bases of communities and the industries that serve them .
a related concern is that homes and businesses around the world will eventually become under-@@ insu@@ red or even un@@ insur@@ able , owing to the frequency of we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ related catastro@@ ph@@ es .
cli@@ mat@@ e@@ wise , a global network of insurance industry organizations , has already warned that the world is facing a $ 100 billion annual climate risk “ protection gap ” .
no single international organization or authority has all the answers to the cas@@ c@@ ade of challenges that climate change has triggered .
but some are taking key leadership roles and pushing governments and local communities to act with more urgency .
one of the more promising initiatives to accelerate solutions , launched just this week , is the global commission on adaptation , chaired by former un sec@@ retary-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon , micro@@ soft co-@@ founder bill g@@ ates , and world bank ce@@ o krist@@ al@@ ina ge@@ or@@ gi@@ eva .
over the next 15 years , the world will need to invest some $ 90 tril@@ lion in infrastructure improvements .
how these projects proceed , and whether they are designed with low-@@ carbon features , could lead the world toward a mo@@ re-@@ climate re@@ sili@@ ent future – or they could undermine food , water , and security for decades to come .
adapting to climate change
cop@@ enhagen – striking the right balance between preventing global warming and adapting to its effects is one of the most important – and most v@@ ex@@ ing – policy questions of our age .
it is also often ignored .
according to the conventional wisdom of many environmental campaign@@ ers , we should first do everything we can to mitig@@ ate global warming , and only then focus on adaptation strategies .
this seems wrong – even im@@ moral – if we could do more for people and the planet through adaptation .
moreover , it is in@@ consistent with the in@@ es@@ capable fact that , whatever we do , we cannot prevent all of global warming ’ s effects .
if we are ill-@@ prepared , global warming will cause more deaths and dev@@ ast@@ ation , especially in poor countries and fragile societies .
adaptation would also mean saving many lives from catastro@@ ph@@ es not related to global warming .
if we prepare societies for more fer@@ o@@ cious hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es in the future , for example , we are also helping them to cope better with today ’ s extreme weather .
there has been a huge amount of research into the ways that humans cause climate change , and how we can reduce it .
much less work has been devoted to adaptation .
it is important to acknowledge that some adaptation strategies will lead to more greenh@@ ou@@ se-@@ gas emissions .
responding to water scar@@ city by re-@@ using and treating wa@@ ste@@ water , or through deep@@ -@@ well pum@@ ping and des@@ al@@ ination , will increase fossi@@ l-@@ fuel use .
using more air-@@ conditioning to cool our houses in summer will do the same – although this is vital if we want to save lives .
adaptation could allow for higher carbon emissions in another way : reducing the damage and harm that we experience from global warming , giving us more time to implement alternatives to reli@@ ance on fossil fuels .
should any of this stop us from using adaptation strategies ?
to arrive at an informed answer , we need to work out how the planet will look in 2@@ 100 if we invest different amounts in adaptation and carbon cuts .
we need to take into account the increase in emissions that adaptation will cause .
the most critical issue isn ’ t any rise or fall in emissions . it is how much climate damage we can avoid .
how much of the planet can we help by dealing with rising sea levels ?
how many lives can we spare from heat , star@@ v@@ ation , or malaria ?
these are the real reasons we care about global warming .
reaching a proper answer to these questions requires extensive economic model@@ ing , with different variables calculated and regional differences analy@@ zed .
new research by three itali@@ an economists , fran@@ ces@@ co bo@@ s@@ ello , car@@ lo car@@ r@@ aro , and en@@ ri@@ ca de cian does this , and , ultimately , provides a powerful economic case for a much greater focus on adaptation .
they first look at the different ways that climate change will affect us at mid-@@ century .
this work is based on standard scenarios , and carries the typical c@@ av@@ e@@ ats of predic@@ tions far into the future .
nevertheless , they find that many of our biggest concerns will turn out to be tri@@ vi@@ al , or even beneficial .
se@@ a-@@ level rises will be a very minor concern for every country , with the financial impact adding up to less than 0.1 % of g@@ d@@ p .
health problems will be negli@@ gible for all but a few nations .
and global warming ’ s impact would reduce energy consumption for almost all nations .
the important effects are on agriculture and tourism , where nations will lose , on average , about 0.5 % of g@@ d@@ p from each sector .
but much of this damage will be avoided by people choosing for themselves to adapt to a change in their environment .
farmers will choose plants that thri@@ ve in heat .
new houses will be designed to deal with war@@ mer temperatures .
simple economic models , often quoted in the media , show that un@@ constra@@ ined global warming would cost a substantial 2 % of g@@ d@@ p in the rich world by the end of the century .
but this fails to acknowledge that people will change their behavior when the environment changes .
taking adaptation into account , rich countries will adapt to the negative consequences of global warming and exploit the positive changes , creating a total positive effect of global warming worth about 0.1 % of g@@ d@@ p .
poor countries will be hit harder , however .
adaptation will reduce the climate chan@@ ge-@@ related losses from 5 % of g@@ d@@ p to slightly less than 3 % – but this is still a significant impact .
the real challenge of global warming , therefore , lies in tackling its impact on the third world .
here , more needs to be done , above and beyond the adaptation that will happen naturally .
importantly , the new research shows that adaptation would achieve a lot more than cuts in carbon emissions .
reducing emissions to a level that does not ext@@ ingu@@ ish economic growth could aver@@ t $ 3 tril@@ lion worth of damage , whereas adaptation could prevent around $ 8 tril@@ lion worth of damage .
for every dollar spent on adaptation , we would achieve about $ 1.@@ 70 worth of positive changes for the planet .
the economic case for focusing more on adaptation is clear .
the crucial next step is to ensure that economic arguments become a stronger part of our political debate about how to address global warming .
a day for plan@@ etary justice
pr@@ inc@@ et@@ on – what we are doing to our planet , to our children and grand@@ children , and to the poor , by our he@@ ed@@ less production of greenhouse gases , is one of the great moral wron@@ gs of our age .
on oc@@ tober 24 , you can stand up against this in@@ justice .
oc@@ tober 24 is 350 day .
the name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that , according to j@@ im han@@ sen , perhaps the world ’ s leading climate scienti@@ st , we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastro@@ p@@ hic climate change .
it is a measure of the seri@@ ousness of our problem that co@@ 2 is already at 3@@ 86 pp@@ m , and is rising by two pp@@ m each year .
the need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predic@@ tions of global warming – den@@ ounced as “ alarm@@ ist ” when they were first made just a few years ago – have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative .
we are appro@@ aching a point of no return , at which feedback lo@@ ops will k@@ ick in and continue to warm the planet , no matter what we do .
the mel@@ ting of ar@@ c@@ tic ice is one example .
four hundred years ago , expl@@ or@@ ers sought the legendary “ nor@@ theast passage ” across the north of europ@@ e and rus@@ sia to ch@@ ina .
they found the ar@@ c@@ tic ice im@@ penet@@ rable , and soon gave up their quest .
this year , commercial vessels successfully navig@@ ated the nor@@ theast passage .
that is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is war@@ mer than it has been for a very long time .
but ic@@ e-@@ free ar@@ c@@ tic waters are more than a symp@@ tom of global warming .
they are themselves a cause of further warming : ice and snow reflect the sun ’ s rays .
an ic@@ e-@@ free surface absor@@ bs more warm@@ th from the sun than one covered in snow or ice . in other words , our greenhouse gas emissions have , by causing enough warming to melt the ar@@ c@@ tic ice , created a feedback loo@@ p that will generate more warming , and melt more ice , even if we were to stop emit@@ ting all greenhouse gases tomorrow .
other feedback lo@@ ops pose a similar danger .
in si@@ ber@@ ia , vast quantities of me@@ than@@ e , an extremely po@@ tent greenhouse gas , are locked up in what used to be called “ per@@ ma@@ fro@@ st ” – regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen .
but areas that used to be frozen are now th@@ a@@ wing , rele@@ asing me@@ than@@ e and thus contributing to further warming – and to further th@@ a@@ wing , which releases more me@@ than@@ e .
developing nations are gras@@ ping just how ou@@ trage@@ ous the current distribution of greenh@@ ou@@ se-@@ gas emissions really is .
at the united nations summit on climate change in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber , president pau@@ l k@@ ag@@ ame of r@@ wand@@ a pointed out that , while developed nations outside afri@@ ca are almost entirely responsible for the problem , its greatest impact will probably be on afri@@ ca , which has few resources to cope with the challenge .
k@@ ag@@ ame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for co@@ 2 emissions , and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above thei@@ rs .
the money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid , but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropri@@ ated : far more than their fair share of our atmosphere ’ s capacity to absor@@ b our waste gases .
s@@ ri lan@@ ka took a similar stance , using studies from the un intergovernmental panel on climate change to calcul@@ ate that in 2008 , environmentally per@@ missible carbon emissions total@@ ed no more than 2,@@ 17@@ 2 kil@@ o@@ grams per person . in fact , the world ’ s per capita emissions were 4,@@ 700 kil@@ o@@ grams , or more than double the per@@ missible limit .
but , while emissions in the rich nations were far above the per@@ missible limit , s@@ ri lan@@ kan emissions were , at 6@@ 60 kil@@ o@@ grams , well below it .
as s@@ ri lan@@ ka ’ s government pointed out , “ that means low-@@ emit@@ ting countries like us could not em@@ it more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy poll@@ uting countries without our consent . ”
this situation is an in@@ justice of vast propor@@ tions , remin@@ is@@ cent of – and argu@@ ably much worse than – the no@@ w-@@ re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated col@@ oni@@ alism of the western powers in the nine@@ teenth century .
the task of reme@@ dying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in cop@@ enhagen in dec@@ ember .
many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change , but what most of them regard as “ strong action ” will not be enough to get us back below 350 pp@@ m .
in some countries , including the united states , there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps .
on oc@@ tober 24 , people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 pp@@ m of co@@ 2 .
there will be clim@@ bers hang@@ ing bann@@ ers high in the him@@ al@@ ay@@ as , where the gl@@ aci@@ ers are mel@@ ting , and s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ vers at au@@ str@@ alia ’ s great barrier re@@ ef , which is threatened by climate change .
churches will ring b@@ ells 350 times , 350 cycl@@ ists will circle towns , and , in many places , 350 trees will be plan@@ ted . at www.@@ 35@@ 0.@@ org you can find out what is happening near you and join in , or put your own idea online .

one day your grand@@ children will ask you : what did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time ?
a day of liber@@ ation
when i was seven years old , in 1960 , my grand@@ mother ange@@ lica opened my eyes to the meaning of 8 may 1945 , the day when n@@ az@@ i ger@@ many s@@ urr@@ en@@ dered and world war ii ended in europ@@ e .
we were spending our summer holidays in nor@@ mand@@ y where the liber@@ ation of europ@@ e from n@@ az@@ ism had started on d-@@ day , 6 jun@@ e 1944 .
one evening , i listened to my parents and my grand@@ mother talking about the past .
i have forgotten the details of their convers@@ ation , but i can still hear my grand@@ mother ’ s si@@ gh of relief when she said “ thank go@@ d we lost that war ! ”
from a child ’ s perspective , it wasn ’ t self-@@ evident that losing was a good thing .
but of course , my grand@@ mother was right to equ@@ ate defeat with liber@@ ation .
the more i have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago , the clearer i have seen another , less obvious dimension in what she said : it is “ we ” who lost the war .
collecti@@ vely , the ger@@ mans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal out@@ si@@ ders called “ n@@ az@@ is ” – n@@ az@@ ism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of ger@@ mans , and every german was liable for its atro@@ cities whether or not he or she had adher@@ ed to it individually .
in today ’ s ger@@ many , an overwhelming majority subscri@@ bes to the pro@@ position that 8 may 1945 was a day of liber@@ ation – not only for europ@@ e , but also for ger@@ many itself .
compared to public opinion in 1960 , that ’ s certainly an enormous progress .
but parado@@ x@@ ically , it may also contain an element of for@@ get@@ fulness , because it tends to conce@@ al the fact that liber@@ ation required a military defeat .
to use my grand@@ mother ’ s par@@ l@@ ance , it is not “ us ” who were the liber@@ ators , but “ them ” .
the way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself .
this is what the term “ politics of memory ” is meant to indicate .
and this is why it doesn ’ t matter whether the relevant events happened 60 years ago ( as world war ii ) , 90 years ( as in the case of the ar@@ men@@ ian genocide ) or even 600 years ( such as the battle of ko@@ so@@ vo in 13@@ 89 ) .
a violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present , as can be observed in the current dispute between ch@@ ina and south korea on one side , and jap@@ an on the other .
a war of memories , in turn , may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future .
former perpet@@ r@@ ators often try to de-@@ legitim@@ ize their former victims ’ moral sup@@ eri@@ ority by claiming they were victims themselves .
therefore , the 60@@ th anniversary of the fire@@ bom@@ bing of dres@@ den by al@@ lied forces on 13 f@@ ebru@@ ary 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the german “ politics of memory ” than the 60@@ th anniversary of 8 may 1945 is going to be .
far-@@ right groups in@@ fam@@ ously du@@ b@@ bed the attack by which at least 30@@ ,000 people were killed “ dres@@ den ’ s h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st of bom@@ bs . ”
fortunately , their propaganda campaign has been a failure .
although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in dres@@ den and other german cities were innocent at an individual level , there can be no doubt it was mor@@ ally imperative that ger@@ many be defe@@ ated collecti@@ vely .
on the left side of the german political spectrum , the pro@@ position that 8 may 1945 was a day of liber@@ ation remains un@@ challeng@@ ed .
however , it is sometimes re@@ pressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result .
le@@ ft-@@ wing p@@ aci@@ f@@ ism tends to over@@ look this simple fact .
its s@@ log@@ an “ never again war ! ” is only half the truth – the other half is “ never again appe@@ as@@ ement ! ” 8 may 1945 was not “ zero hour , ” as a popular saying in ger@@ many goes .
it had an ant@@ ec@@ e@@ dent , that is , a lack of pre-@@ emp@@ tive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in n@@ az@@ i ger@@ many during the 1930 ’ s .
there is yet another lesson to be learned .
yes , 8 may 1945 was a day of liber@@ ation to which the so@@ vi@@ et army contributed decisi@@ vely .
but for millions of central and east europ@@ e@@ ans , liber@@ ation was followed by stal@@ in ’ s op@@ pres@@ sive regime .
the current war of memories between the bal@@ tic re@@ public@@ s and rus@@ sia , with regard to the international celebration in mo@@ sco@@ w on 9 may this year , remin@@ ds ger@@ many of a special historic responsibility .
the ger@@ man@@ -@@ so@@ vi@@ et non-@@ aggres@@ sion treaty , the so-called hit@@ ler@@ -@@ stal@@ in pact , concluded in aug@@ ust 19@@ 39 , had been supple@@ mented by a secret app@@ endi@@ x divi@@ ding the border states fin@@ land , est@@ onia , lat@@ via , li@@ thu@@ ania , pol@@ and and roman@@ ia into sp@@ heres of interest for the two parties .
but exc@@ using n@@ az@@ i atro@@ cities by pointing to stal@@ in@@ ist crimes is an intellec@@ tu@@ ally and mor@@ ally unacceptable str@@ at@@ a@@ gem .
when chan@@ cell@@ or sch@@ rö@@ der tra@@ vels to mo@@ sco@@ w for the red square celeb@@ rations , he should bear in mind n@@ az@@ i ger@@ many ’ s contribution to the bal@@ tic tragedy .
on 8 may this year , public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget .
they will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned , history is bound to repeat itself .
all this is perfectly true .
but personally , i will also remember my grand@@ mother ’ s sentence “ thank go@@ d we lost that war ! ” thank go@@ d – and thanks to all those bra@@ ve al@@ lied soldiers who sacri@@ fic@@ ed their lives for the sake of europ@@ e ’ s liberty .
s@@ anta bar@@ bara – the chin@@ ese government ’ s campaign to have its currency , the ren@@ min@@ bi , included in the international monetary fund ’ s reserve asset appears to be on the br@@ ink of success .
last week , im@@ f staff formally recommended adding the ren@@ min@@ bi to the bas@@ ket of currencies that determin@@ es the value of its so-called special drawing rights ( s@@ dr@@ s ) .
the addition of the ren@@ min@@ bi to the bas@@ ket , which currently includes the us dollar , the euro , the bri@@ tish po@@ und , and the jap@@ anese yen , would provide ch@@ ina with a boost to its pres@@ tige .
more important , it would advance the government ’ s efforts to internation@@ alize the ren@@ min@@ bi .
but it would also be a mistake .
the decision to recommend the ren@@ min@@ bi ’ s inclusion , far from having been made on sound economic grounds , can only be understood as political .
as such , the long-term consequences are likely to be regrettable .
on a purely technical basis , the ren@@ min@@ bi ’ s qualifications for inclusion in the s@@ d@@ r bas@@ ket are question@@ able .
traditionally , the im@@ f has insisted on two criteria : a currency ’ s issuing country must be among the world ’ s leading expor@@ ters , and the currency must be “ freely us@@ able ” – widely used and tra@@ ded .
as the world ’ s largest expor@@ ter , ch@@ ina clearly meets the first condition .
the second , however , is probably still beyond its reach .
the ren@@ min@@ bi is by no means in the same le@@ ague as the s@@ d@@ r bas@@ ket ’ s four inc@@ umb@@ ent currencies .
in 2014 , ch@@ ina ’ s currency ran@@ ked sevent@@ h in global centr@@ al-@@ bank reserves , eigh@@ th in international bond issu@@ ance , and 11@@ th in global currency trading . moreover , the ren@@ min@@ bi remains non-@@ con@@ verti@@ ble for most capital transactions , ch@@ ina ’ s financial markets are pri@@ mi@@ tive , and trading margins for the exchange rate are still set daily by the monetary authorities .
indeed , as recently as aug@@ ust , the im@@ f was skep@@ tical about adding the ren@@ min@@ bi to the s@@ d@@ r bas@@ ket , saying that “ significant work ” was still needed , and sugge@@ sting that a decision should be put off until 2016 in order to ensure a “ smooth ” transition .
so why did the im@@ f fli@@ p ?
the answer is obvious : ch@@ ina mounted a full-@@ court press to change minds .
ren@@ min@@ bi@@ -@@ den@@ omin@@ ated government bonds were issued in lon@@ don , and plans were laid to create new trading platforms for the currency in several europ@@ ean financial centers .
and chin@@ ese policymakers made it abund@@ antly clear how un@@ happy they would be with a negative decision .
their pressure paid off .
one by one , western governments fell in line behind the ren@@ min@@ bi , despite its practical limitations .
the fund got the message , and now the fix is in .
the recommendation to en@@ large the s@@ d@@ r bas@@ ket has been warmly backed by christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de , the im@@ f ’ s managing director , and a final decision by the fund ’ s executive board is expected at the end of the month .
many would argue that this is a positive development .
certainly , it mol@@ li@@ fies ch@@ ina ’ s leaders , offering them a stronger incentive to continue to work within the existing international monetary regime .
recent chin@@ ese initiatives , especially the creation of the asi@@ an infrastructure investment bank , have given rise to fears that the country intends to build a new set of international institutions to compete with west@@ ern@@ -@@ dominated organizations like the im@@ f .
the decision to add the ren@@ min@@ bi to the s@@ d@@ r bas@@ ket may have put that danger into re@@ mission .
on the other hand , the move sets a worrying prece@@ dent , in@@ jecting politics into a policy area that had been governed by objective economic considerations .
conc@@ ei@@ v@@ ably , over the longer term , ch@@ ina ’ s successful campaign could now open the door to lob@@ b@@ ying by other governments to include their currencies as well .
why not add the s@@ wis@@ s fran@@ c or the can@@ adi@@ an dollar ?
or , for that matter , why not include the rus@@ sian ru@@ ble or indi@@ an ru@@ pe@@ e ?
what was once the dig@@ ni@@ fied preserve of obviously elite currencies could become the site of mess@@ y political batt@@ les for elev@@ ated status .
of course , it can be argued that ch@@ ina ’ s recent economic tra@@ jec@@ tory means that it is only a matter of time before the ren@@ min@@ bi does become a match for the s@@ d@@ r ’ s inc@@ um@@ ben@@ ts .
after all , international use of the currency has been growing exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally .
but that optimistic assessment over@@ estimates the ren@@ min@@ bi ’ s prospects and illustr@@ ates the danger of linear extra@@ pol@@ ation of the past into the future .
likewise , use of the ren@@ min@@ bi for the purpose of invo@@ ic@@ ing and sett@@ ling trade with ch@@ ina is bound to continue growing .
but in terms of the all-@@ important roles of a currency as an investment vehicle or reserve asset , the outlook for the ren@@ min@@ bi is much less promising , owing to ch@@ ina ’ s still@@ -@@ tight capital controls and low level of financial development .
nor is inclusion of the ren@@ min@@ bi in the s@@ d@@ r bas@@ ket likely to provide as big a boost to the currency ’ s internation@@ alization as many believe .
some central banks may decide to follow suit , adding ren@@ min@@ bi@@ -@@ den@@ omin@@ ated assets to their reserves to match the composition of the bas@@ ket .
but the increase will be margin@@ al at best – some $ 40 billion in the next few years , according to the im@@ f ’ s calculations .
with global reserves now total@@ ing more than $ 10 tril@@ lion , that is a mere drop in the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al bu@@ cket .
the political reasons for including the ren@@ min@@ bi in the s@@ d@@ r are all too clear .
unfortunately , the risks of doing so are no less obvious .
a defeat for international tax cooperation
new y@@ or@@ k – most of the world ’ s governments – e@@ ager to mobili@@ ze more tax revenues to finance development and cur@@ b per@@ va@@ sive tax@@ -@@ avoid@@ ance schemes , such as those revealed in the so-called luxem@@ bourg le@@ aks sc@@ andal last year – have an interest in collabor@@ ating on taxation matters .
yet at the third international conference on financing for development , held in addi@@ s ab@@ aba last month , the momentum toward strengthening international tax cooperation came to an ab@@ rupt halt .
developed countries blocked a proposal at the conference to establish an intergovernmental tax body within the united nations to replace the current un committee of experts .
these countries insist that tax cooperation should take place exclusively under the leadership of the o@@ ec@@ d , a body that they control .
the rest of the world should hope this will prove to be a pause rather than an end to progress on international tax cooperation , which began 13 years ago , at the first international conference on financing for development in mon@@ ter@@ rey , m@@ ex@@ ico .
two years later , in 2004 , the united nations economic and social council ( eco@@ so@@ c ) upgraded its “ ad hoc group ” of tax experts to a regular committee .
this meant that the experts would meet regularly and have an expanded mandate that went beyond merely updating a model double-@@ taxation treaty .
four years later , at the second conference on financing for development , in do@@ ha , q@@ atar , policymakers acknowledged that more needed to be done in tax matters , and asked eco@@ so@@ c to consider strengthening institutional arrangements .
and then , in the year leading up to the addi@@ s ab@@ aba conference , the un sec@@ retary-@@ general endorsed the need for “ an intergovernmental committee on tax cooperation , under the au@@ spices of the united nations . ”
his endor@@ sement , along with strong support from non@@ governmental organizations and the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation , gave greater force to the demand by developing countries , organized around the group of 77 and ch@@ ina , for an equal voice in setting global tax norms .
up until the 11@@ th hour of negotiations in addi@@ s ab@@ aba , they stood firm in calling for an intergovernmental body with the mandate and resources to create a coherent global framework for international tax cooperation .
but to no av@@ ail : developed countries , led by the united states and the united king@@ dom – home to many of the multinational corporations imp@@ lic@@ ated in the “ lu@@ x le@@ aks ” – succeeded in blocking this mu@@ ch-@@ needed advance in global governance .
in the end , the addi@@ s ab@@ aba action agenda provides that the current committee of experts will continue to function according to its 2004 mandate , with three additional meeting days per year , all funded through voluntary contributions .
that is a pro@@ found@@ ly dis@@ appointing outcome .
the developed countries have an argument – but not a convincing one .
the o@@ ec@@ d , whose members are essentially the world ’ s 34 rich@@ est countries , certainly has the capacity to set international standards on taxation .
yet the dom@@ ination of a select group of countries over tax norms has meant that , in reality , the global governance architecture for taxation has not kept pace with globalization .
the mon@@ ter@@ rey consensus reached in 2002 included a call to enhance “ the voice and participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm@@ s-@@ setting . ”
but although the o@@ ec@@ d invites some developing countries to participate in its discussions to establish norms , it offers them no decision-making power .
the o@@ ec@@ d is thus a weak surro@@ gate for a globally representative intergovernmental forum .
such a body must operate under the au@@ spices of the united nations , which bears the institutional legitimacy necessary to respond effectively to the challenges of globalization with coherent global standards to combat abu@@ sive tax practices and ensure fair taxation of corporate profits worldwide .
despite the dis@@ appointment in addi@@ s ab@@ aba , the call for reform of the international tax system is not likely to be si@@ len@@ ced .
instead , it will grow lou@@ der on all sides , as the developed countries ’ counter-@@ productive resistance to any give and take on international cooperation results in a ts@@ un@@ ami of unilateral tax measures beyond o@@ ec@@ d control .
only the poor die young
ro@@ tter@@ dam – people who are lower on the soci@@ o@@ economic lad@@ der ( indicated by their level of education , occupation , or income ) have shorter and less healthy lives , on average , than those on higher r@@ ungs .
indeed , life expec@@ tan@@ cy at birth often varies by 5-@@ 10 years , depending on social and economic well-being , with poorer people spending 10-@@ 20 more years of life suffering from illness or disability than their weal@@ th@@ ier counterparts .
in the nine@@ teenth century , this situation would not have been surprising , given low average income , widespread poverty , and lack of social security .
but such data are commonly reported for high-@@ income countries today , including those ranking high on indi@@ ces of economic prosperity and human development – even western europ@@ e ’ s highly developed welfare states .
since the end of world war ii , western europ@@ ean countries have tried to reduce soci@@ o@@ economic inequality , or offset its consequences , through progressive taxation , social security programs , and a wide range of collecti@@ vely financed provisions , such as public housing , education , health care , and cultural and leisure facilities .
but , while these policies have reduced inequalities in some social and economic outcomes , including income , housing quality , and heal@@ th-@@ care access , they have been insufficient to eliminate health inequalities .
long-term time-@@ series data indicate that the soci@@ o@@ economic mortality gap narro@@ wed before the 1950 ’ s , but has grown substantially since then .
more pu@@ zz@@ ling is the fact that more generous welfare policies do not translate into smaller health disparities .
even the nor@@ dic countries – world leaders when it comes to creating universal and well-@@ designed welfare policies that cover citizens from cra@@ dle to grave – face significant health disparities , despite their relatively low income inequality .
to be sure , modern welfare states have far from abolished social inequality , with disparities in access to material and human resources continuing to generate highly un@@ equal lives among their citizens .
but the welfare state ’ s aim has never been radical re@@ distribution of wealth .
rather , welfare policies are intended to create a compromise between the interests of employees and employers , labor@@ ers and the middle classes .
as a result , their re@@ distribu@@ tive effects are modest .
so , while a partial failure of the welfare state may help to explain the persist@@ ence of health inequalities , one must look elsewhere to understand – and reverse – their rise .
two possible explanations have emerged from the rapidly growing scientific literature on the subject : selective up@@ ward social mobility and delayed diff@@ u@@ sion of behavi@@ oral change .
in reality , both factors are at work .
during the twen@@ tieth century , social mobility increased slowly but steadily in all high-@@ income countries , with educational achievement and occupational status depending less on family background and more on co@@ gni@@ tive ability and other personal characteristics .
as a result , the lower soci@@ o@@ economic groups have not only shr@@ unk in size , but have probably also become more homo@@ gen@@ eous in terms of personal characteristics that increase the risk of health problems .
moreover , people with a higher soci@@ o@@ economic position tend to adopt new behavi@@ ors first , and to abandon more re@@ adily behavi@@ ors that are found to damage health , such as smoking and high-@@ fat di@@ ets .
given this , new behavi@@ oral recommendations by health authorities tend to exacerb@@ ate health inequalities , at least temporarily .
significant disparities in smoking , physical exercise , diet , and alcohol consumption aff@@ lic@@ t many of western europ@@ e ’ s welfare states .
the welfare system , which was created to combat poverty , has been less effective against “ diseases of aff@@ lu@@ ence ” like heart disease and lung cancer .
all of this highlights the need for creative solutions to disparities that un@@ necessarily and un@@ fairly b@@ light the lives of those who have the least , generate massive heal@@ th-@@ care costs , and pose a barrier to increased lab@@ or-@@ force participation ( impe@@ ding efforts in some countries to raise the retirement age ) .
in the last few decades , social policy in most western europ@@ ean countries has moved away from re@@ distribution .
this is a mistake , given that the consequences of this shift – rising income inequality , weaker social safety nets , and reduced heal@@ th-@@ care access – will ag@@ grav@@ ate health inequalities in the long run .
in fact , more , bet@@ ter-@@ targeted re@@ distribu@@ tive policies , which account for the effects of selective up@@ ward social mobility and different rates of diff@@ u@@ sion of behavi@@ oral change , are crucial to improving health outcomes in lower soci@@ o@@ economic groups .
income support should be comple@@ mented by preventive health programs , while health liter@@ acy programs could help to dimin@@ ish the link between low co@@ gni@@ tive ability and bad health .
equal access to health care is not enough .
reducing inequalities in health outcomes requires more intensive health care for patients in lower soci@@ o@@ economic bra@@ ckets , tailored to their specific needs and challenges .
for example , revenues from tobacco taxation , which dis@@ proportion@@ ately affects lower income groups , should be used to fund c@@ ess@@ ation-@@ support programs that target disadvantaged smo@@ kers .
significant and persistent health inequality indicates that , by raising the health levels of those with lower incomes or less education , massive stri@@ des could be made in improving populations ’ overall health .
this may require res@@ ha@@ ping the welfare system to some extent , but the pa@@ yo@@ ff would be well worth the effort .
the mouse click that ro@@ ared
cam@@ bridge – until recently , cy@@ ber security has primarily interested computer ge@@ eks and clo@@ ak@@ -@@ and-@@ d@@ ag@@ ger types .
the internet ’ s cre@@ ators , part of a small , en@@ closed community , were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern .
but , with some three billion or so users on the web nowadays , that very openness has become a serious vulnerability ; indeed , it is endanger@@ ing the vast economic opportunities that the internet has opened for the world .
a “ cy@@ ber attack ” can take any number of forms , including simple prob@@ es , de@@ fac@@ ement of web sites , den@@ i@@ al-@@ of-@@ service attacks , es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , and destruction of data .
and the term “ cy@@ ber war , ” though best defined as any hosti@@ le action in cy@@ ber@@ space that amp@@ li@@ fies or is equivalent to major physical violence , remains equally prote@@ an , reflecting definitions of “ war ” that range from armed conflict to any concer@@ ted effort to solve a problem ( for example , “ war on poverty ” ) .
cy@@ ber war and cy@@ ber es@@ pi@@ on@@ age are largely associated with states , while cy@@ ber crime and cy@@ ber terrorism are mostly associated with non-@@ state actors .
the highest costs currently stem from es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and crime ; but , over the next decade or so , cy@@ ber war and cy@@ ber terrorism may become greater threats than they are today .
moreover , as al@@ liances and tac@@ tics evol@@ ve , the categories may increasingly overla@@ p .
terrorists might buy mal@@ ware from criminals , and governments might find it useful to hide behind both .
some people argue that deter@@ r@@ ence does not work in cy@@ ber@@ space , owing to the difficulties of attri@@ bution .
even when the source of an attack can be successfully dis@@ gu@@ ised under a “ false flag , ” governments may find themselves sufficiently en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in sy@@ mmet@@ ri@@ cally inter@@ dependent relationships such that a major attack would be counter@@ productive .
ch@@ ina , for example , would lose from an attack that severely damaged the ameri@@ can economy , and vice vers@@ a .
an unknown att@@ acker may also be deter@@ red by cy@@ ber-@@ security measures .
if fire@@ walls are strong , or redund@@ ancy and re@@ sili@@ ence allow quick recovery , or the prospect of a self-@@ enfor@@ cing response ( “ an electric f@@ ence ” ) seems possible , an attack becomes less attractive .
while accurate attri@@ bution of the ultimate source of a cy@@ ber attack is sometimes difficult , the determination does not have to be air@@ tight .
to the extent that false fla@@ gs are im@@ perfect and rum@@ ors of the source of an attack are widely deemed credible ( though not legally prob@@ ative ) , rep@@ ut@@ ational damage to an att@@ acker ’ s soft power may contribute to deter@@ r@@ ence .
finally , a reputation for offensive capability and a declared policy that keeps open the means of re@@ tali@@ ation can help to reinforce deter@@ r@@ ence .
of course , non-@@ state actors are harder to deter , so improved def@@ enses such as pre-@@ emp@@ tion and human intelligence become important in such cases .
but , among states , even nuclear deter@@ r@@ ence was more complex than it first looked , and that is dou@@ bly true of deter@@ r@@ ence in the cy@@ ber domain .
given its global nature , the internet requires a degree of international cooperation to be able to function .
some people call for the cy@@ ber equivalent of formal arm@@ s-@@ control treaties .
but differences in cultural norms and the difficulty of verification would make such treaties hard to negotiate or implement .
at the same time , it is important to pursue international efforts to develop rules of the road that can limit conflict .
the most promising areas for international cooperation today most likely concern problems posed for states by third parties such as criminals and terrorists .
rus@@ sia and ch@@ ina have sought to establish a treaty establishing broad international over@@ sight of the internet and “ information security , ” which would pro@@ hibit dec@@ eption and em@@ bed@@ ding mali@@ cious code or circu@@ it@@ ry that could be activated in the event of war .
but the us has argued that arm@@ s-@@ control measures bann@@ ing offensive capabilities could weak@@ en def@@ enses against attacks and would be impossible to verify or enforce .
likewise , in terms of political values , the us has resist@@ ed agreements that could legitim@@ ize author@@ itarian governments ’ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of the internet – for example , by the “ great fire@@ wall of ch@@ ina . ”
moreover , cultural differences impede any broad agreements on regulating online content .
nonetheless , it may be possible to identify behavi@@ ors like cy@@ ber crime that are illegal in many domestic juris@@ dic@@ tions .
trying to limit all in@@ tru@@ sions would be impossible , but one could start with cy@@ ber crime and cy@@ ber terrorism involving non-@@ state parties .
here , major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on for@@ en@@ si@@ cs and controls .
the transnational cy@@ ber domain poses new questions about the meaning of national security .
some of the most important responses must be national and unilateral , focused on hygiene , redund@@ ancy , and re@@ sili@@ ence .
it is likely , however , that major governments will soon discover that the in@@ security created by non-@@ state cy@@ ber actors will require closer cooperation among governments .
a practical agenda for revolutionary times
ox@@ ford – as the world ’ s financial leaders gather for the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings , many working people around the world are demanding radical change , because they sense that their voices are not being heard .
those who are supposed to represent them should not ignore this anger and frustr@@ ation any longer .
according to the 2017 ed@@ el@@ man trust barom@@ eter , the public ’ s confidence in the status quo has collap@@ sed worldwide , owing to widely held concerns about globalization , innovation , immigration , the ero@@ sion of social values , and corruption .
at the same time , the response from el@@ ites who regard themselves as the guar@@ di@@ ans of economic growth has sometimes made matters worse .
if they think they can al@@ lay public concerns simply by expla@@ ining the benefits of the current global economic system and t@@ weak@@ ing policies to compensate those left behind , they are in for a ru@@ de aw@@ ak@@ ening .
earlier this month , the im@@ f , world bank , and world trade organization published a joint report ext@@ oll@@ ing the benefits of trade as a driver of productivity growth , competition , and consumer choice .
the report ’ s argument in favor of free trade is not new , nor is its recommendation that “ active lab@@ or-@@ market policies ” be used to c@@ us@@ hion the b@@ low of lost jobs and live@@ li@@ hoods .
what is new is that repe@@ ating these claims , without also addressing people ’ s deeper concerns , can now do more harm than good .
global public opinion has changed dramatically in recent years .
a majority of people worldwide – and up to 72 % of people in fran@@ ce and ital@@ y – now believe that the system has failed them .
moreover , only 29 % of people across 28 countries now trust government leaders , while three-@@ quarters of those surve@@ yed say they trust reform@@ ers who would up@@ end the status quo .
these findings suggest that those defending free trade have lost credibility with the people they hope to persuade .
world leaders need to recognize that today ’ s popul@@ ist revol@@ ts are being fu@@ eled by a sense of lost dignity – a sen@@ timent that does not factor into most policymakers ’ pres@@ cription for economic growth and compens@@ atory payments .
work@@ ing-@@ class voters have lash@@ ed out because they feel not just economically abandoned , but also socially dis@@ da@@ ined and cultur@@ ally margin@@ alized .
their vote is the only means they have left to hit back at the establishment .
the first order of business should be to reach out to those who feel voic@@ eless and un@@ represented .
during the us presidential campaign , don@@ ald tru@@ mp ta@@ pped into this sen@@ timent when he vo@@ wed to pun@@ ish any company that moves jobs to ch@@ ina or m@@ ex@@ ico .
as the fil@@ m@@ maker mi@@ cha@@ el mo@@ ore explained prior to the election , ameri@@ can work@@ ing-@@ class voters were desper@@ ate to hear someone promise to take on big business .
the fact that it took a popul@@ ist pl@@ ut@@ oc@@ rat to do it under@@ sco@@ res the extent to which the ameri@@ can labor movement has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
political parties that originally emerged from the labor movement have long since shi@@ fted to the “ center . ”
they now accept political contributions from big business , and have accordingly adopting the language of common prosperity and “ consensus politics , ” leaving the many working people who do not share in that prosperity and consensus feeling dis@@ regarded and displaced .
second , the quality of work , and the status that it conf@@ ers , must be improved .
in weal@@ thy countries , prec@@ arious , po@@ or@@ ly paid , and even dangerous forms of employment are becoming increasingly common .
a recent blo@@ om@@ berg business@@ week story describes how temporary workers at au@@ to-@@ parts factories in al@@ ab@@ ama are paid just $ 7.@@ 25 per hour , and must work in hazardous conditions with no safety training .
in 2010 , these workers suffered work in@@ juries at a 50 % higher rate than uni@@ on@@ ized au@@ to-@@ parts workers elsewhere .
as the o@@ ec@@ d has shown , “ non-@@ standard ” work is pro@@ lifer@@ ating globally .
this trend is contributing to deterior@@ ating working conditions , making workers feel increasingly hel@@ pl@@ ess and vulnerable .
revers@@ ing it will require robust standards to ensure workplace safety , fair pay , and the right to enter into collec@@ tiv@@ e-@@ bar@@ gaining arrangements .
governments will have to intervene to set these standards , as they did during the nine@@ teenth and twen@@ tieth centuries to improve ab@@ ys@@ mal conditions in factories .
otherwise , businesses will not be able to be@@ have dec@@ ently , for fear of being under@@ cut by un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous competitors .
finally , more opportunities must be created for the next generation – and not just economic opportunities .
since the 2008 financial crisis , many governments have reduced their investments in health , education , housing , and other forms of human capital . many have also cut support for the unemployed , hom@@ eless , or in@@ deb@@ ted .
as a result , those who have fallen behind are deprived not just of resources , but , more important , the chance to pursue their aspirations .
as the im@@ f , world bank , and w@@ to show in their report , free trade and globalization have certainly increased the size of the overall economic p@@ ie .
in theory , this should have expanded governments ’ capacity to compensate those left behind and create the conditions for them to get ahead .
in fact , the opposite has happened , owing to government cut@@ backs since 2008 .
the establishment ’ s agenda has been failing for too long .
and as el@@ ites continue to proc@@ la@@ im the benefits of free trade and globalization , they are merely wi@@ dening the ch@@ as@@ m of popular m@@ istr@@ ust .
over the past year , that m@@ istr@@ ust has bo@@ iled over in many countries , with voters in one election after another re@@ jecting the status quo .
pi@@ ec@@ em@@ e@@ al cur@@ bs on globalization will not be enough to qu@@ ell the revol@@ t .
instead , world leaders must leave their echo chamber , take ordinary people ’ s concerns seriously , diversi@@ fy their views , and think about why so many have lost faith in the system .
the development costs of hom@@ opho@@ bia
lon@@ don – as a ga@@ y man living in ni@@ geri@@ a , my biggest challenge was choosing between my sexu@@ ality and my job .
in 2004 , i was at the start of my acting career .
i had just left university , and i was featured in “ ro@@ ses and thor@@ ns , ” a pri@@ me@@ -@@ time so@@ ap opera on gal@@ ax@@ y television , one of ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s most popular tv stations .
i was playing the role of “ rich@@ ard , ” the only son of a rich family who was having an affair with the house ma@@ id .
wh@@ isp@@ ers were making the ro@@ unds about my private life , and i decided it was time to come out .
so i agreed to go on ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s mo@@ st-@@ wat@@ ched television talk show to discuss my sexu@@ ality .
almost immediately , my character was eliminated .
and when my job disappeared , so did my financial security .
like many ga@@ y men and les@@ bi@@ ans in afri@@ ca , my choice was between economic freedom and mental im@@ prison@@ ment .
this year , ni@@ geri@@ a and ug@@ anda put in place dra@@ con@@ ian anti-@@ ga@@ y laws , spark@@ ing a worldwide debate about human rights .
this debate has also started at the world bank , whose president , j@@ im y@@ ong k@@ im , recently declared that “ institution@@ alized discrimination is bad for people and for societies . ”
k@@ im ’ s statement has invited criticism and contro@@ vers@@ y .
often , as in ug@@ anda and ni@@ geri@@ a , we hear the claim that opposition to official discrimination against ga@@ y , les@@ bian , bis@@ ex@@ ual , and trans@@ gender ( l@@ g@@ bt ) people is simply a way to impose “ western ” values on afri@@ ca .
but this assumes that homo@@ sexu@@ ality is “ un@@ -@@ afri@@ can . ”
and , despite the absence of evidence that any given country or continent does not have l@@ g@@ bt people ( and ample evidence to the contrary ) , it is an assumption that an increasing number of afri@@ can leaders have embra@@ ced .
ug@@ anda ’ s president yo@@ wer@@ i muse@@ ven@@ i followed suit when signing the anti-@@ ga@@ y bill into law in 2014 .
other leaders , from g@@ ambi@@ a ’ s president y@@ ah@@ ya j@@ am@@ me@@ h to zim@@ babwe ’ s ro@@ bert mu@@ gabe , have spoken in the same v@@ ein .
these official attitudes have caused significant suffering for afri@@ ca ’ s ga@@ ys and les@@ bi@@ ans .
indeed , the price of hom@@ opho@@ bia for ga@@ y people in many afri@@ can countries is pain@@ fully clear : legal penalties , social o@@ stra@@ c@@ ism , and mo@@ b justice .
but here is what afri@@ ca ’ s anti-@@ ga@@ y leaders miss : legal protec@@ tions are not only a hum@@ an-@@ rights issue , but also an economic issue .
k@@ im is exactly right , and research has started measuring the economic costs of hom@@ opho@@ bia by exploring links between anti-@@ ga@@ y sen@@ timent and poverty in countries where laws and social attitudes pro@@ scri@@ be sam@@ e-@@ sex relationships .
m@@ .@@ v. le@@ e bad@@ get@@ t , an econom@@ ist at the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts-@@ am@@ her@@ st , presented the initial findings of a study of the economic implications of hom@@ opho@@ bia in indi@@ a at a world bank meeting in mar@@ ch 2014 .
bad@@ get@@ t estimated that the indi@@ an economy may have lost up to $ 23.@@ 1 billion in 2012 in direct health costs alone , owing to de@@ pression , suici@@ de , and hi@@ v treatment disparities caused by anti-@@ ga@@ y sti@@ g@@ ma and discrimination .
in addition to such concrete costs , being ga@@ y can bring violence , job loss , family rejection , har@@ ass@@ ment in schools , and pressure to mar@@ ry .
as a result , many ga@@ y people have less education , lower productivity , lower earnings , poorer health , and a shorter life expec@@ tan@@ cy .
in ni@@ geri@@ a , i started the independent project for equal rights ( tiers ) in 2005 to respond to the increasing number of people who were losing their jobs because of suspici@@ ons about their sexu@@ ality .
during our first year , we provided support for doz@@ ens of people .
one young man , “ ol@@ um@@ i@@ de , ” was given temporary housing after his family ki@@ cked him out for being ga@@ y . another , “ u@@ che , ” was fi@@ red from his job as a chef after his sexu@@ ality was revealed .
tiers helped him with accommodation and capital to set up a catering business .
though almost 10 years have passed , it is still not safe to use their real names .
across afri@@ ca , the economic costs of discrimination are increasing , in line with growing pressure on employers , land@@ l@@ ords , heal@@ th-@@ care providers , educational institutions , and others to exclude l@@ g@@ bt people .
today , the world bank and other development agencies are ma@@ pping out the global development priorities that will follow the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals ( m@@ d@@ gs ) , which officially end in 2015 and included specific targets for promoting gender equality and em@@ power@@ ing women as a strategy for economic growth .
looking ahead , the bank should take the same approach to l@@ g@@ bt rights and make legal protec@@ tions for sexual orientation and gender identity a condition for countries receiving loans .
building recognition of women ’ s rights into the m@@ d@@ gs did not cor@@ rupt afri@@ can cultures by imposing “ western ” values ; in fact , it strengthened many afri@@ can countries , which now lead the world in the representation of women in government .
by pursuing similar protec@@ tions for l@@ g@@ bt people , international investment and aid can improve economic performance and strengthen respect for basic human rights .
the world bank , always war@@ y of ent@@ ang@@ ling itself in “ political ” questions , empha@@ sizes that it is not a global hum@@ an-@@ rights enfor@@ c@@ er .
but it also increasingly recogni@@ zes its own role as a facilit@@ ator in helping bank members realize their hum@@ an-@@ rights obligations .
l@@ g@@ bt rights should be a test case .
aid to governments that permit specific social groups to be o@@ stra@@ ci@@ zed can carry very real economic costs .
as new loans are considered , steps should be taken to ensure that the benefits are as inclusive as possible .
if the bank – which currently l@@ ends ni@@ geri@@ a almost $ 5.@@ 5 billion and expects to commit an additional $ 2 billion in each of the next four years – moved in this direction , other fun@@ ders might follow .
afri@@ ca ’ s l@@ g@@ bt people desper@@ ately need such powerful allies in their struggle for human and economic rights .
a decade of hu@@ go ch@@ á@@ vez
s@@ an jo@@ se – we should have known that something was am@@ iss when , during president hu@@ go ch@@ á@@ vez ’ s inaug@@ ur@@ ation on f@@ ebru@@ ary 2 , 1999 , he s@@ wor@@ e on vene@@ zu@@ ela ’ s 4@@ 0-@@ year-old constitution by declar@@ ing it “ m@@ ori@@ b@@ und . ”
under “ the m@@ ori@@ b@@ und , ” as the constitution came to be known , vene@@ zu@@ ela not only had eight peaceful presidential transi@@ tions , but also enjoyed the fruits of democratic plur@@ alism and strong civil and political liber@@ ties .
of course , during this period vene@@ zu@@ ela produced as much corruption and political ir@@ responsibility as it did bar@@ rel@@ s of oil . nonetheless , vene@@ zu@@ ela f@@ ared far better than the average l@@ atin ameri@@ can country .
it wasn ’ t swit@@ zer@@ land , but , by anyone ’ s measure , it was a genuine democracy .
elections are still held , but the legacy of ch@@ á@@ vez ’ s decade in power consists , first and foremost , in the demo@@ lition of democratic institutions .
elected in a lands@@ li@@ de to clean up the political vi@@ ces of the previous establishment , ch@@ á@@ vez chose to throw the baby out with the bath@@ water .
the previous regime , including its system of checks and balances and its tradition of political tolerance , did disappear , but its vi@@ ces – particularly gra@@ ft and de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ ery – became worse than ever .
pretty much like 10 years ago , vene@@ zu@@ ela , once a destination for immigrants from around the world , remains under-@@ developed .
more fundamentally , ch@@ á@@ vez represents ideas that have long sti@@ fl@@ ed l@@ atin ameri@@ ca ’ s political and economic growth .
this includes the notion that social justice can be achieved only by aband@@ oning the path of reform and re@@ jecting “ bour@@ geo@@ is ” democratic forms in favor of “ real ” democracy , born of revolutionary p@@ urity and the leader ’ s mill@@ en@@ arian dreams .
that ’ s simply false .
though the ch@@ á@@ vez revolution has made progress against poverty and inequality , it is hardly sustainable and re@@ eks of pat@@ ron@@ age .
in fact , one can find similar achievements in ch@@ ile and bra@@ zi@@ l , which have not given up on democratic checks and balances , political plur@@ alism , or freedom of the press , and have not enjoyed the luxury of $ 300 billion in oil revenue in the space of one decade .
moreover , it ought not to be forgotten that between 1950 and 1980 , vene@@ zu@@ ela itself reduced extreme poverty from 43 % to 8 % of the population , one of the lowest figures in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca .
it did so with democracy and freedom .
ch@@ á@@ vez also repe@@ ats , ad nau@@ se@@ am , the idea that others are to blame for l@@ atin ameri@@ ca ’ s ills .
this is the per@@ ni@@ cious vic@@ tim@@ ization nar@@ r@@ ative – still very popular in universities across l@@ atin ameri@@ ca – the late vene@@ zu@@ el@@ an journalist car@@ los ran@@ gel el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently re@@ fut@@ ed in books such as the third world ideology .
it is obvious that y@@ an@@ ke@@ e imperi@@ alism cannot be bl@@ amed for vene@@ zu@@ ela ’ s em@@ aci@@ ated tax system , dis@@ m@@ ally bad schools , ra@@ mp@@ ant corruption , high crime rate , and fe@@ eb@@ le political institutions .
in all of these areas , vene@@ zu@@ ela is far@@ ing po@@ or@@ ly even by l@@ atin ameri@@ ca ’ s low standards .
this is particularly true in the case of institutional weakness .
when ch@@ á@@ vez decla@@ res “ m@@ ori@@ b@@ und ” a legitimate constitution , or when he proc@@ laim@@ s l ’ é@@ tat c ’ est mo@@ i by declar@@ ing a national holiday to commem@@ or@@ ate his 10 years in power , we see el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent examples of a hom@@ em@@ ade institutional far@@ ce that would do@@ om any country to the n@@ inth circle of mis@@ ery .
none of these ideas would fly , of course , in a cont@@ ented nation .
in this sense , vene@@ zu@@ ela ’ s experience speaks to all of l@@ atin ameri@@ ca .
the combination of economic growth ( now in reverse because of the global crisis ) and atro@@ cious levels of inequality and social seg@@ mentation will continue to bre@@ ed the same un@@ met expectations and social res@@ ent@@ ment that cleared ch@@ á@@ vez ’ s path to power .
as long as l@@ atin ameri@@ ca ’ s democracies fail to take seriously the tasks of reducing inequality , spreading opportunity , and nur@@ turing more co@@ hesi@@ ve societies , they will continue to court disaster .
to avoid this outcome , it is vital to pur@@ ge certain re@@ ac@@ tionary and num@@ bing belie@@ fs , including the idea that reducing poverty ob@@ vi@@ ates the need to address inequality , or that development is possible without introducing modern and progressive tax systems .
if the tent@@ h anniversary of ch@@ á@@ vez ’ s ten@@ ure can serve as a remin@@ der of the per@@ ils that bes@@ et un@@ just democracies – especially now that a new electoral cycle in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca lo@@ oms – then vene@@ zu@@ ela ’ s agon@@ izing recent history would , at least , be re@@ deemed .
a declaration of independence from the us
ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush is ob@@ s@@ essed with the war on terrorism , especially with the military response to terrorism .
ameri@@ can foreign policy reflects that ob@@ session .
this year , the us will spend around $ 450 billion for the military , including the costs of the i@@ ra@@ q war , while it will spend no more than $ 15 billion to overcome global poverty , global environmental degra@@ dation , and global diseases .
in other words , us foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity , global public health , and a sustainable environment .
throughout 2003 , the world lived with b@@ ush &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ob@@ session .
debate over i@@ ra@@ q dominated international diplomacy , and took up almost the entire un agenda .
the war in i@@ ra@@ q cost countless innocent lives , such as when the un headquarters in bag@@ h@@ dad was bom@@ bed .
at the same time , b@@ ush &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s emphasis on a one-@@ dimensional , milit@@ ari@@ zed approach to global problems has fu@@ eled un@@ rest and instability throughout the islam@@ ic world , leading to increased terrorism in tur@@ key , north afri@@ ca , sau@@ di arab@@ ia , and sou@@ theast a@@ sia .
the nature of suffering around the world hardly justi@@ fies this narrow strategy .
focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues , and empha@@ si@@ zing the military response to it , will not bring prosperity and peace , or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks .
while 3@@ ,000 innocent people died in the us on se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 11 , 2001 , in afri@@ ca 8@@ ,000 innocent children die every day from malaria .
yet malaria is prev@@ ent@@ able and treat@@ able .
the problem is that most of afri@@ ca is too poor to mobili@@ ze the methods of prevention ( bed nets ) and treatments ( anti-@@ mal@@ ari@@ al medicines ) that could save millions of children every year .
the us sp@@ ends more on i@@ ra@@ q each day than it does on afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s malaria in a year .
as 2003 draws to a close , it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the ob@@ s@@ essive , failing approach of ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s government .
president b@@ ush should be made to understand that the us will find no true international support if ameri@@ ca speaks inc@@ ess@@ antly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world : poverty , lack of access to safe water and sanit@@ ation , vulnerability to disease , and climate change .
ir@@ on@@ ically , president b@@ ush claims that the un does not follow through on its word .
he declared in lon@@ don recently that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the credibility of the un depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
yet the us repeatedly viol@@ ates its own un ple@@ dges .
for example , at the international conference on financing for development , in mon@@ ter@@ rey , m@@ ex@@ ico in mar@@ ch 2002 , ameri@@ ca signed the mon@@ ter@@ rey consensus , which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.@@ 7 % of national income .
that would bring an additional $ 60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the us@@ --@@ approximately what it spent on i@@ ra@@ q this year .
yet president b@@ ush has simply ignored this promise .
there are many other similar commitments that the us has made in recent years to the un that remain utter@@ ly un@@ fulfilled .
the us promised action to fight man@@ -@@ made climate change as a signat@@ ory to the un framework convention on climate change ( un@@ f@@ c@@ c ) in 1992 .
ameri@@ ca also promis@@ ed@@ --@@ in the do@@ ha declaration in 200@@ 1@@ --@@ to open its markets to the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s poorest countries .
yet at can@@ cu@@ n , m@@ ex@@ ico earlier this summer , it refused to open its markets even to exports from strug@@ gling afri@@ can economies .
the list goes on and on .
at the mill@@ enni@@ um assembly in 2000 , the us promised to pursue reduction of global poverty , yet it has taken few steps in that direction .
at the world summit on sustainable development in j@@ oh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg in 2002 , ameri@@ ca committed itself to protect global eco@@ systems , yet little has been seen or heard from us policy makers on this issue since then .
ameri@@ ca is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the un .
but because the us is the rich@@ est , most powerful country in the world , its neg@@ le@@ ct is devastating .
if the us really wants to under@@ cut terrorism , it must recognize the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness of extremis@@ m , poverty , and environmental degra@@ dation , and it will need to understand the stru@@ gg@@ les for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere .
but the world should not wait for the ameri@@ ca to come to its senses .
the us represents just 5 % of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s population , and just one vote of 19@@ 1 countries in the un general assembly .
poor countries , especially the democracies of the developing world-@@ -@@ bra@@ zi@@ l , south afri@@ ca , indi@@ a , m@@ ex@@ ico , gh@@ ana , the p@@ hili@@ pp@@ in@@ es@@ --@@ should say , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; we need to act on the issues that concern us , not just on the issues that concern the us . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
what the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from ameri@@ can will@@ fulness .
a de-@@ glob@@ alized world ?
cam@@ bridge – it may take a few months or a couple of years , but one way or another the united states and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today ’ s crisis .
the world economy , however , is unlikely to look the same .
even with the worst of the crisis over , we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-@@ glob@@ alized world , one in which international trade gro@@ ws at a s@@ lower pace , there is less external finance , and rich countries ’ appe@@ ti@@ te for running large curr@@ ent-@@ account deficits is significantly dimin@@ ished .
will this spell do@@ om for developing countries ?
not nec@@ es@@ arily .
growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct vari@@ ants .
first comes growth driven by foreign borro@@ wing .
second is growth as a by-@@ product of commodity bo@@ oms .
third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products .
the first two models are at greater risk than the third .
but we should not lose sleep over them , because they are fla@@ wed and ultimately un@@ sustainable .
what should be of greater concern is the potential p@@ light of countries in the last group .
these countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today ’ s new realities .
the first two growth models inv@@ ari@@ ably come to a bad end .
foreign borro@@ wing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while , but reli@@ ance on foreign capital is an un@@ wise strategy .
the problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction , but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth , based on over@@ valued currencies and investments in non-@@ tra@@ ded goods and services , such as housing and construction .
growth driven by high commodity prices is also sus@@ cep@@ tible to bu@@ sts , for similar reasons . commodity prices tend to move in cycles .
when they are high , they are ap@@ t to crow@@ d out investments in manufac@@ tures and other , non-@@ traditional tra@@ d@@ ables .
moreover , commodity bo@@ oms frequently produce ug@@ ly politics in countries with weak institutions , leading to costly stru@@ gg@@ les for resource ren@@ ts , which are rarely invested wis@@ ely .
so it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady , long-term growth during the last six decades are those that re@@ lied on a different strategy : promoting diversification into manufactured and other “ modern ” goods .
by cap@@ turing a growing share of world markets for manufac@@ tures and other non-@@ primary products , these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-@@ productivity activities .
their governments pursued not just good “ fundament@@ als ” ( e.g. , macroeconomic stability and an out@@ ward orientation ) , but also what might be called “ produc@@ tiv@@ ist ” policies : under@@ valued currencies , industrial policies , and financial controls .
ch@@ ina exemp@@ li@@ fied this approach .
its growth was fu@@ eled by an extra@@ ordin@@ arily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods .
in recent years , ch@@ ina also got ho@@ oked on a large trade surplus vis-à-vis the us – the counter@@ part of its under@@ valued currency .
but it wasn ’ t just ch@@ ina .
countries that had been growing rapidly in the run@@ -up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade sur@@ pl@@ uses ( or very small deficits ) .
these countries did not want to be recipi@@ ents of capital in@@ flows , because they realized that this would w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c with their need to maintain competitive currencies .
it is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances – typ@@ i@@ fied by the bilateral us-@@ ch@@ ina trade relationship – played a major contributing role in the great crash .
global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large curr@@ ent-@@ account imbalances in the future .
but a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tra@@ dable goods and services .
in the past , this push was accommod@@ ated by the willingness of the us and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits .
this is no longer a feasible strategy for large or mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income developing countries .
so , are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at od@@ ds with each other ?
will developing countries ’ need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clas@@ h with the world ’ s in@@ tolerance of trade imbalances ?
there is in fact no inherent conflict , once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade sur@@ pl@@ uses , nor even the volume of their exports .
what matters is their output of modern industrial goods ( and services ) , which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand exp@@ ands simultaneously .
maintaining an under@@ valued currency has the up@@ side that it subsidi@@ zes the production of such goods ; but it also has the down@@ side that it taxes domestic consumption – which is why it generates a trade surplus .
by encouraging industrial production directly , it is possible to have the up@@ side without the down@@ side .
there are many ways that this can be done , including reducing the cost of domestic in@@ puts and services through targeted investments in infrastructure .
explicit industrial policies can be an even more po@@ tent instrument .
the key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate ( in real terms ) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly .
so the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade s@@ lows in and there is reduced appe@@ ti@@ te for capital flows and trade imbalances .
their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood .
one such imp@@ lication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate .
another is that external policy actors ( for example , the world trade organization ) will have to be more toler@@ ant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutr@@ alized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate .
greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances .
a democratic bur@@ ma ?
mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il gor@@ b@@ ach@@ e@@ v ’ s liber@@ alizing policies of glas@@ no@@ st and per@@ est@@ ro@@ ika in the so@@ vi@@ et union emerged at one of the cold war ’ s dark@@ est hours , with us president ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an pushing for strategic missi@@ le defense and the two sides fighting pro@@ xy wars in afgh@@ an@@ istan and elsewhere .
den@@ g xi@@ a@@ oping ’ s economic opening followed ch@@ ina ’ s bloo@@ dy – and failed – invasion of vi@@ et@@ nam in 1978 .
and south afri@@ ca ’ s last apar@@ thei@@ d leader , f. w. de kl@@ er@@ k , was initially perceived as just another ap@@ olog@@ ist for the system – hardly the man to free n@@ elson mand@@ ela and over@@ see the end of white minority rule .
now the world is suddenly asking whether bur@@ ma ( my@@ an@@ mar ) , after six decades of military dictatorship , has embark@@ ed on a genuine political transition that could end the country ’ s par@@ i@@ ah status .
is bur@@ ma , like south afri@@ ca under de kl@@ er@@ k , truly po@@ ised to emerge from a half-@@ century of self-@@ imposed isolation ?
and can a@@ ung s@@ an su@@ u k@@ y@@ i , the her@@ o@@ ic opposition leader , and th@@ ein sein , bur@@ ma ’ s new president , engine@@ er a political transition as sk@@ ill@@ fully and peac@@ efully as mand@@ ela and de kl@@ er@@ k did for south afri@@ ca in the early 1990 ’ s ?
despite her two decades of house arrest and isolation , su@@ u k@@ y@@ i poss@@ esses two of the gi@@ fts that enabled mand@@ ela to carry out his great task : a re@@ ass@@ uring ser@@ en@@ ity and an utter lack of v@@ indi@@ cti@@ veness .
as bur@@ ma ’ s authorities test reform , these gi@@ fts , together with her negotiating skills and , most of all , her vast moral authority , will be tested as never before .
moreover , unlike mand@@ ela during his 2@@ 7-@@ year im@@ prison@@ ment , su@@ u k@@ y@@ i has had her hopes raised – and d@@ ash@@ ed – before .
in the mid-@@ 1990 ’ s , and again in 200@@ 2-@@ 2003 , reconciliation between su@@ u k@@ y@@ i ’ s national le@@ ague for democracy ( n@@ ld ) and the military jun@@ ta seemed to be in the off@@ ing .
on both occasions , however , the regime ’ s hard@@ lin@@ ers gained the upper hand , cr@@ ush@@ ing prospects for reform .
yet su@@ u k@@ y@@ i , and much of the bur@@ m@@ ese opposition , is beginning to admit that today ’ s political liberalization might be the real thing .
because bur@@ ma ’ s gener@@ als say almost nothing in public , it is difficult to fa@@ tho@@ m why they allowed elections that elev@@ ated th@@ ein sein to power , or to explain their willingness to embra@@ ce dialogue with the long-@@ sup@@ pressed opposition .
recent events suggest one possible explanation : bur@@ ma ’ s rul@@ ers have grown war@@ y of ch@@ ina ’ s almost smo@@ ther@@ ing embra@@ ce – a result of the country ’ s international isolation .
indeed , public protests against ch@@ ina ’ s commercial exploitation of bur@@ ma ’ s natural resources became so widespread that the government called a halt to construction by chin@@ ese investors on the huge and environmentally damaging my@@ it@@ s@@ one dam on the ir@@ ra@@ w@@ ad@@ dy river .
th@@ ein sein ’ s decision to halt the project is clearly an important policy shift .
it is also a signal to the outside world that bur@@ ma ’ s new government may be much more willing than any of its predec@@ essors to he@@ ed both public pressure and international opinion , both of which veh@@ e@@ ment@@ ly opposed the dam ’ s construction .
almost simultaneously , th@@ ein sein offered even stronger signals that his was a very different bur@@ m@@ ese administration : he fre@@ ed political prisoners and invited su@@ u k@@ y@@ i for direct talks with him .
indeed , su@@ u k@@ y@@ i now enjoys far greater freedom of movement than she has at any time since she received the no@@ bel peace prize 20 years ago , and the n@@ ld recently announced that it will field candidates in the forthcoming by-@@ elections to the country ’ s newly established parliament .
if su@@ u k@@ y@@ i is permitted to campaign free of restra@@ int , for both her own seat and to boost the electoral chances of her n@@ ld colleagues , it will be clear that th@@ ein sein and his government are truly determined to bring their country in from the cold .
for both su@@ u k@@ y@@ i and th@@ ein sein , every step from now on will be delicate , to be cali@@ br@@ ated with the same care and deliber@@ ation that mand@@ ela and de kl@@ er@@ k used in bri@@ dging their differences and leading their country out of isolation .
but the international community , too , must act with great care .
while th@@ ein sein would undoubtedly wish to see the my@@ ri@@ ad economic and political sanctions imposed on bur@@ ma quickly li@@ fted , it is too soon for a general eas@@ ing of such measures .
but the outside world should demonstrate that every clear move toward greater political openness will mer@@ it more international political and economic engagement .
the jap@@ an investment bank ’ s decision to invest in port development in bur@@ ma – essential if the economy , too , is to be opened – is one positive sign that the world will keep pace with th@@ ein sein step for step .
and us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s decision to send secret@@ ary of state h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton to bur@@ ma to meet th@@ ein sein is another clear sign that the world is ready to end the country ’ s isolation .
closer to home , as@@ ean ’ s recent decision to give bur@@ ma a chance to chair the organization in 2014 under@@ sco@@ res its neigh@@ b@@ ors ’ desire for the country ’ s full participation in a@@ sia ’ s growing prosperity .
fortunately , bur@@ ma already has in a@@ ung s@@ an su@@ u k@@ y@@ i its very own n@@ elson mand@@ ela .
a democratic wind@@ fall for tur@@ key ?
tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s seem@@ ing fall from grace with the us may turn out to be a bl@@ essing in dis@@ gu@@ ise .
the i@@ ra@@ q war and the tor@@ tured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s conflict between its &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; strategic alliance &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; with ameri@@ ca and its drive to join the eu .
the elections last nov@@ ember that brought the justice and development party ( ak@@ p ) to power were prece@@ ded by a dispute between the members of the th@@ en-@@ ruling coalition over en@@ acting the reforms demanded by the eu .
some liberal elements of that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sec@@ ular &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; coalition re@@ signed from the government and joined with the islam@@ ists to push the reforms through parliament .
after coming to power , the ak@@ p &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s leaders , former islam@@ ists who had re@@ inv@@ ented themselves as &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; conservative democ@@ rats , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; energe@@ tically engaged with the us , the eu , and the un on issues ranging from c@@ yp@@ rus to i@@ ra@@ q , from kur@@ dish language rights to other human rights issues within tur@@ key .
having suffered the op@@ pres@@ sive practices of tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sec@@ ular &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; state and recogni@@ zing that human rights must be protected acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the-@@ board , the ak@@ p emerged as a credible inter@@ loc@@ utor with the west .
the us , pre@@ occupied with the supposed spec@@ ter of a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; clas@@ h of civi@@ liz@@ ations &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; between is@@ lam and the west , saw the ak@@ p &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s modern , we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed face as an opportunity and urged the eu to admit tur@@ key .
today , both &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; conservative democ@@ rats &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and liber@@ als advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the eu , while opponents include extreme nation@@ alists , of both left and right , as well as some elements of the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sec@@ ular &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; establishment .
the europ@@ e@@ ans could have ti@@ pped the balance decisi@@ vely in favor of the reform@@ ers by finally rewar@@ ding the efforts of the pro-@@ eu tur@@ ks at last dec@@ ember &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s summit of eu leaders .
instead , the eu kept tur@@ key waiting yet again , putting off formal negotiations that , in any case , may take years to complete .
europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s persistent reluc@@ tance puts the tur@@ ks in a qu@@ and@@ ary .
the ameri@@ cans want full eu membership for tur@@ ke@@ y-@@ -@@ a long@@ standing nat@@ o member and close ameri@@ can ally-@@ -@@ while europ@@ e@@ ans compla@@ in about the tur@@ k@@ ish military &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s domestic political role .
the parado@@ x is that , by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s options , europ@@ e may end up reinforcing tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s status as a military out@@ post of the us .
then , despite massive us pressure , tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s parliament un@@ expec@@ tedly rejected the government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s proposal to allow us troops in tur@@ key to launch an invasion from tur@@ k@@ ish territory .
tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s refusal to grant the ameri@@ cans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war .
the tur@@ k@@ ish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis , an effort no current eu member could have con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated .
parliament &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s rejection of us troops power@@ fully re@@ fut@@ es suggestions that tur@@ key was primarily concerned about the size of the ameri@@ can aid package on offer as an in@@ duc@@ ement to cooperate .
suggestions that characterized the vote as reve@@ aling the government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s true &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; islam@@ ic &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament , the re@@ publi@@ can people &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s part@@ y-@@ -@@ founded by at@@ at@@ ür@@ k and still fully &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ist &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; --@@ voted against the plan .
likewise , other elements of tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s sec@@ ular establishment , including the president and the military leadership , either opposed or were lu@@ ke@@ warm , at best , to the idea of war in i@@ ra@@ q .
tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s military initially remained silent on the issue , un@@ character@@ is@@ tically watching the civilian political process un@@ fold .
by contrast , the military had earlier publicly cri@@ tici@@ zed ak@@ p initiatives on c@@ yp@@ rus .
their silence on i@@ ra@@ q reflected their ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion about un@@ wanted alternatives : either support the us plan and risk encouraging kur@@ dish moves toward an independent state , or oppose the ameri@@ cans and jeop@@ ardi@@ ze a critical strategic relationship .
they chose to de@@ fer to the civilian leadership and to parliament , which , in voting down the us plan , reflected overwhelming public sen@@ timent against the war .
only after the vote did the chief of staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in ameri@@ can troops .
in fact , the alle@@ ge@@ dly islam@@ ic party had sk@@ il@@ fully managed to negotiate with an un@@ rel@@ enting us , consult with the tur@@ k@@ ish military and president , and share all information with the public and parliament .
walking a fine line in what was essentially a lo@@ se-@@ lose situation , the party leadership laid out the sta@@ kes clearly and judi@@ ci@@ ously left the final decision to parliament .
the outcome was a victory for tur@@ k@@ ish democracy and recognized as such internationally .
after the us military action in i@@ ra@@ q , the tables may be turning in surprising ways .
as ameri@@ ca establishes itself in i@@ ra@@ q , tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s geo@@ political military significance may decline .
yet the declared ameri@@ can aim of building a mus@@ li@@ m democracy in i@@ ra@@ q will only enhance tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s symbolic importance as a role model .
this shift in tur@@ key &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform .
with careful management , tur@@ key may find itself drawing closer to europ@@ e , while re@@ building its relationship with ameri@@ ca .
a de@@ valuation option for southern europ@@ e
cam@@ bridge – this year is likely to mark a ma@@ ke-@@ or-@@ break or@@ deal for the euro .
the eurozone ’ s survival demands a credible solution to its long-@@ running sovereign@@ -@@ debt crisis , which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances – external and fiscal – which are at the heart of that crisis .
the crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone .
from 1996 to 2010 , unit labor costs in ger@@ many increased by just 8 % , and by 13 % in fran@@ ce .
compare that to 24 % in portu@@ gal , 35 % in sp@@ ain , 37 % in ital@@ y , and a wh@@ opping 59 % in gre@@ ece .
the result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries , a problem compo@@ unded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern europ@@ e ( and fran@@ ce ) – much of it o@@ wed to foreign credi@@ tors .
does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone ?
sup@@ pose , for example , that portu@@ gal were to leave and re-@@ introduce the es@@ cu@@ do .
the ensu@@ ing ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate de@@ valuation would immediately lower the price of portu@@ gal ’ s exports , raise its import prices , stimulate the economy , and bring about mu@@ ch-@@ needed growth .
but a euro exit would be a mess@@ y affair .
the resulting tur@@ mo@@ il could very well tru@@ mp any short-term gains in competitiveness from de@@ valuation .
there is a remark@@ ably simple alternative that does not require southern europ@@ e ’ s troub@@ led economies to abandon the euro and de@@ value their exchange rates .
it involves increasing the valu@@ e-@@ added tax while cutting pay@@ roll taxes .
our recent research demonstrates that such a “ fiscal de@@ valuation ” has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on g@@ d@@ p , consumption , employment , and inflation .
a currency de@@ valuation works by making imports more costly and exports cheaper .
a v@@ at / pay@@ roll@@ -@@ tax s@@ wap would do exactly the same thing .
an increase in v@@ at raises the price of imported goods , as foreign firms face a higher tax .
to ensure that domestic firms do not have an incentive to raise prices , an increase in v@@ at needs to be accompanied by a cut in pay@@ roll taxes .
moreover , since exports are exempt from v@@ at , the price of domestic exports will fall .
the desired competitiveness effects of ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate de@@ valuation can thus be had while staying in the euro .
this policy can also help on the fiscal front .
as is true of an ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate de@@ valuation , the positive impact on growth of an increase in competitiveness can strengthen the fiscal position by raising tax revenues .
moreover , an important advantage of fiscal de@@ valu@@ ations is that they generate additional revenues in proportion to the country ’ s trade deficit .
for countries that are suffering from weak competitiveness and , as a consequence , running trade deficits , this typically means more revenues , especially in the short run .
both act as a wealth lev@@ y : inflation means that bon@@ d@@ holders suffer a real loss in proportion to their wealth and the size of the de@@ valuation .
if taxes on capital are not adjusted , holders of domestic stocks suffer a comparable loss .
by contrast , many transfers , such as unemployment benefits , health benefits , and public pensions , are inde@@ xed to inflation , and thus maintain their real value .
the same is true of minimum wages .
these distribu@@ tive effects play an important role in the politics of ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate de@@ valu@@ ations , and most of these effects appear in fiscal de@@ valu@@ ations as well .
fiscal de@@ valu@@ ations already have some advocates .
indeed , f@@ ren@@ ch president ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s government just announced one .
and concerns that a fiscal de@@ valuation will conflict with euro rules can be met by simply pointing out that ger@@ many ’ s government carried one out in 2007 , though by another name , when it raised v@@ at from 16 % to 19 % and cut employers ’ contribution to social insurance , from 6.@@ 5 % to 4.@@ 2 % .
in short , there are simple fiscal alternatives to ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate de@@ valuation that can address southern europ@@ e ’ s short-term competitiveness problems .
to be sure , feasible fiscal de@@ valu@@ ations would be limited in size .
but , together with debt restructuring , accommod@@ ative monetary policy , liquidity support from the europ@@ ean central bank , and mu@@ ch-@@ required structural reforms , they can help to put these troub@@ led economies on a sound footing without a euro break@@ up or a major au@@ ster@@ ity-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed recession .
a di@@ m light on global warming
cop@@ enhagen – am@@ id a growing wave of concern about climate change , many countries – including bra@@ zi@@ l , au@@ str@@ alia , the united states , and the members of the europ@@ ean union – passed laws in the 2000 ’ s out@@ la@@ wing or severely restric@@ ting access to inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent light bul@@ bs .
the intention was understandable : if everyone in the world ex@@ changed most light bul@@ bs for energy-@@ efficient compact flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent light bul@@ bs ( c@@ fl@@ s ) , we could save 3.5 % of all electricity , or 1 % of our co@@ 2 emissions .
the current attempt by re@@ public@@ ans in the us congress to roll back ameri@@ ca ’ s effort to ban inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs has revi@@ ved this discussion .
many conten@@ d that the agenda is being driven by k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le-@@ dra@@ gging cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ change den@@ i@@ ers .
but it ’ s worth taking a closer look at the pre@@ mise that bann@@ ing things is the sm@@ art@@ est way to tackle global warming .
let ’ s be clear : we do need to tackle climate change .
but this does not mean that we should just cut all emissions .
burning fossil fuels also has significant benefits , and we should wei@@ gh those benefits against the costs .
a tax on carbon should be equivalent to its damage .
the best estimate of this is about $ 7 / ton of co@@ 2 or $ 0.@@ 06 / gall@@ on of gas@@ ol@@ ine ( € 0.@@ 0@@ 15 / lit@@ er ) .
most developed countries already have a tax of this size ( and often much larger ) on electricity and fossil fuels , although this also incorpor@@ ates the costs of air pollution and supply in@@ security .
while c@@ fl@@ s are more expensive to buy , they are much cheaper over their li@@ fes@@ p@@ an , because they use much less energy ( even more so with the cost of co@@ 2 fac@@ to@@ red into taxes on electricity ) .
thus , on a straight@@ forward cost-@@ benefit basis , it seems to make sense for most people to switch from inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs to the new , gre@@ ener technology .
this is what is great about technological solutions to climate change : if an alternative option is cheaper , people will start using it .
my household uses c@@ fl@@ s , and i enjoy knowing that i am causing fewer co@@ 2 emissions and spending less money .
why , then , is it even necessary to out@@ law the old bul@@ bs ?
the reason is that monetary cost is only one factor .
many people find it anno@@ ying that c@@ fl@@ s take time to “ warm up . ”
or they believe that their light is “ fun@@ ny . ”
or they worry that the bul@@ bs can spread po@@ ison@@ ous merc@@ ury if they break .
for some people , energy-@@ efficient bul@@ bs can trigger ep@@ i@@ le@@ p@@ tic sei@@ zu@@ res and mig@@ ra@@ ines .
the up-@@ front cost is a factor , too , especially for those on low budgets .
and in places where lights are not used very often , a lower@@ -@@ price inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ b can cost less overall than the energy-@@ efficient alternative .
you might imagine that people could choose the right light bul@@ bs for themselves .
but prop@@ on@@ ents of phas@@ ing out access to inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs argue that they know better .
as us energy secret@@ ary ste@@ ven ch@@ u put it recently , “ we are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money . ”
setting aside other possible objections to this view , there is the problem that it presu@@ mes that all inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs are worth less than $ 7 / ton of co@@ 2 .
this is clearly not true for those who suffer from mig@@ ra@@ ines or ep@@ i@@ le@@ p@@ tic sei@@ zu@@ res because of the new bul@@ bs , or for those who are seriously worried about merc@@ ury , or for those who have other reasons for prefer@@ ring inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs .
the solution should be to focus on improving the technology – making the lights safer , bri@@ ghter , warm up faster , and save more energy , so that more people will replace more of their lights .
but it is not just light bul@@ bs that policymakers have tried to ban .
eu parlia@@ mentari@@ ans voted overwhel@@ m@@ ingly to out@@ law pati@@ o he@@ aters , which one me@@ p declared to be “ a luxury the planet cannot afford . ”
who decides when something is luxurious ?
and where does this end ?
should we out@@ law air conditioning or television satellite boxes because some people find them luxurious ?
should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to move us from a to b with fewer co@@ 2 emissions ?
it makes sense to reflect the cost of co@@ 2 ( among many other factors ) in the price paid to drive our cars or heat our pati@@ os ; but when the phas@@ e-@@ out proce@@ eds more slowly than some law@@ makers wish , a ban is not the right solution .
real reductions in carbon emissions will occur only when better technology makes it worth@@ while for individuals and businesses to change their behavior .
c@@ fl@@ s and other advances can take us part of the way , but there are massive technological hur@@ d@@ les to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than gre@@ ener alternatives .
this is where a lot of policymakers get it wrong .
governments talk far too much about setting a relatively high carbon tax on emissions , while focusing far too little on ensuring a meaningful increase in research and development to bring about necessary break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
limiting access to the ‘ wrong ’ light bul@@ bs or pati@@ o he@@ aters , ultimately , is not the right path .
then , people the world over will choose to use them .
adjust and re@@ schedule or delay and default
br@@ ussel@@ s – as gre@@ ece activ@@ ates its € 45 billion rescue package with the international monetary fund and the europ@@ ean union , it is becoming clear that a new , far more comprehensive approach is needed .
two problems need to be addressed : the credibility of gre@@ ece ’ s fiscal stabili@@ zation program , and how to cover the country ’ s medium-term financing gap .
the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the fiscal adjustment effort being demanded of gre@@ ece is now well known .
the deficit has to be reduced by at least 10 percentage points of g@@ d@@ p ( from around 13 % of g@@ d@@ p to less than 3 % of g@@ d@@ p ) .
the key problem , which has not been addressed so far , is that a fiscal adjustment on this scale requires the government to take two steps that can be implemented only with wide social approval : a cut in wages and a cut in social expenditure .
both steps are now as un@@ popular in gre@@ ece as they are un@@ avoid@@ able .
the country ’ s competitiveness problems are also well known .
unit labor costs have increased by 10-@@ 20 % more than in ger@@ many .
assu@@ ming that gre@@ ece wishes to stay within the eurozone , an “ internal de@@ valuation , ” i.e. , a significant cut in nomin@@ al wages , is inevitable .
the government can ( and has ) cut wages in the public sector , but this is not sufficient .
a large cut in priv@@ ate-@@ sector wages also is urgently needed to stimulate exports ( which currently amount to less than 20 % of g@@ d@@ p , even if one counts both goods and services ) to create at least one source of growth .
gre@@ ece thus needs a “ national competitiveness pact ” in which government , opposition , employers , and workers agree on a set of measures that cut unit labor costs by at least 10 % .
three le@@ vers could be used to reach this goal : adjustment in nomin@@ al wages , extension of working time , and a reduction in soci@@ al-@@ security contributions ( compens@@ ated for by an increase in valu@@ e-@@ added tax ) .
the mix of measures should be left to gre@@ ece to decide , but a cut in unit labor costs of this size is an essential first step for a successful adjustment , and should be a pre-@@ condition for the im@@ f / eu support package .
deep cuts in social expenditure are also un@@ avoid@@ able in order to achieve sustainable public finances .
the growing fiscal deficits in gre@@ ece over the last decade were essentially the result of a massive increase in the size of state social benefits , from 20 % to close to 30 % of g@@ d@@ p , without any significant increase in tax revenues .
contrary to popular perception , the public-@@ sector wage bill is only of margin@@ al importance .
the government has already forced through most of the necessary adjustment in this area .
indeed , cuts in public-@@ sector wages can yield at most 1-@@ 2 % of g@@ d@@ p in fiscal consolidation .
given that social expenditure amounts to close to 60 % of total public spending , a successful fiscal adjustment will ultimately require that it be cut significantly .
the alternative , an increase in tax revenues by almost 50 % in the sp@@ an of a few years , simply is not feasible .
profound reform of the welfare state and building a modern tax administration system requires time .
but financial markets are in no mood to give gre@@ ece time , which brings us to the second major problem facing the country .
in order to gain the brea@@ thing space necessary for the reform process to be effective , the gre@@ ek government could just announce a simple re@@ schedul@@ ing : the due date of all existing public debt is extended by five years at an unchanged interest rate .
in that case , the gre@@ ek government would face no re@@ de@@ mp@@ tions for the next five years and would have to re@@ finance about € 30 billion per year from 2015 onwards , which should be manage@@ able by then .
official financing needs would then be much more limited , and the im@@ f / eu package of around € 45 billion should be sufficient to cover most of the progres@@ sively lower deficits over this grace period .
without such a re@@ schedul@@ ing , it is unlikely that gre@@ ece will be able to roll over the approximately € 30 billion mat@@ uring annually for the next few years .
over time , the eurozone countries would inevitably have to re@@ finance most of gre@@ ece ’ s public debt .
this is a recip@@ e for continuing political problems , as the gre@@ eks would always consider the interest rate too high , while ger@@ many would consider it too low ( at least relative to market rates ) .
moreover , once the eurozone had started re@@ financing gre@@ ece without any contribution from private credi@@ tors , it would be politically impossible to stop .
the type of re@@ schedul@@ ing proposed here would signal the gre@@ ek government ’ s readiness to service its debt in full , and thus might be accepted without too much dis@@ ruption in financial markets .
of course , markets would view any re@@ schedul@@ ing without a credible adjustment program merely as a pre@@ lu@@ de to a real default later on , thus leading to an even higher risk premium .
but even the best adjustment program cannot be financed without some contribution by private credi@@ tors , i.e. , some form of re@@ schedul@@ ing .
the only way out for gre@@ ece is thus to combine both elements : re@@ schedul@@ ing its debt plus national agreements on wages and social expenditure .
the current approach – concentr@@ ating only on the financing needs and fiscal adjustment in 2010 , and leaving all the hard choices for later – will not work .
a do@@ om@@ s@@ day scenario
as ameri@@ ca debates whether or not to inv@@ ade i@@ ra@@ q , fears that the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economic recovery will st@@ all are beginning to cre@@ ep into the discussion ; with that , wor@@ ries about the health of the global economy are growing , too .
a consensus is emerging that the gap between the us economy &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come .
can the situation get worse ?
yes , it can : much worse .
a number of worrying factors about the us economy have been around for a long time :
huge trade deficits have persist@@ ed since ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s mis@@ guided tax cuts of 1981 converted ameri@@ ca from the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s largest credi@@ tor into the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s largest deb@@ tor .
today , these deficits set new records by the month ;
ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s app@@ all@@ ingly low savings rate .
when ameri@@ can wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market bo@@ om@@ ed , this was understandable ; individual ameri@@ cans were becoming ri@@ cher without savings , so why bo@@ ther ?
today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s savings rate , while it has increased slightly , still finds ameri@@ ca at the bottom of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s savings le@@ ague tables ;
la@@ x accounting standards .
the ar@@ thur ander@@ son , en@@ ron , and wor@@ ld@@ com sc@@ and@@ als didn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t emerge out of thin air , but had their origins in the mid-@@ 1990s , when the us treas@@ ury actually interven@@ ed to stop attempts by the sup@@ pose@@ dly independent accounting standards board to improve matters .
bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bub@@ ble ; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities ; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s excess capacity .
to this old bre@@ w , new ingredients have been added , notably the most rapid change in a nation &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fiscal post@@ ure the world has probably ever seen .
in a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; now you see it , now you don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; move only a ma@@ gi@@ cian should love , the $ 3 tril@@ lion , ten year ( non social security ) us budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a g@@ ap@@ ing deficit of $ 2 tril@@ lion dollars .
of course , exc@@ uses are at hand : the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the economic down@@ turn was not anticipated and the increased expendi@@ tures to fight terrorism could not be fore@@ told .
exc@@ uses , exc@@ uses .
as the old saying goes : don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t count your chi@@ ck@@ ens before they hat@@ ch .
the b@@ ush administration not only counted its chi@@ ck@@ ens , it sold them forward !
to anyone with decent ey@@ es@@ ight , it was clear that the ro@@ sy budget projec@@ tions of two years ago were non@@ sense .
clear , too , was the fact that , in promoting its tax cuts , the b@@ ush administration was engaging ( on a multi-@@ billion dollar scale ) in dis@@ honest , en@@ ron@@ -@@ like accounting .
so if things are so bad now , how can they get worse ?
here &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s a plau@@ sible scenario .
to finance its trade deficit , ameri@@ ca must bor@@ row from abroad over a billion dollars a day .
when ameri@@ ca was the only safe haven for global investors , this was easy .
but ameri@@ ca today appears less safe .
the combination of lack of confidence in us corporate accounts , lack of confidence in ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economic policy management ( compo@@ unded by the mounting deficits ) , and ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s soft underlying economic fundament@@ als , has dent@@ ed the us economy &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s global reputation .
as foreigners start pul@@ ling their money out of a country they suspect , the dollar will weak@@ en .
as the dollar weak@@ ens , ameri@@ ca looks even less safe . so a r@@ ush to the door begins .
while a weak dollar may be good for exports , a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater dec@@ lines in confidence .
eventually , even the al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty ameri@@ can consumer will be sha@@ ken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement , especially given b@@ ush &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s proposed ris@@ ky experiments with the social security system .
at that point , ameri@@ cans will join the stam@@ pe@@ de out of their economy .
why sh@@ ouldn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t they ?
they &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ re free to choose where to put their money .
europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative .
but this scenario offers no happy ending for europ@@ e .
a weak@@ ening us economy and the strengthening euro will dam@@ pen europ@@ ean exports .
the europ@@ ean central bank , fix@@ ated on inflation , will be slow to lower interest rates , and the europ@@ ean stability pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses .
europ@@ e will join ameri@@ ca in a down@@ turn , reinforcing ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s decline and setting in motion a global down@@ ward spir@@ al .
i am not predic@@ ting that this will happen .
i hope that the b@@ ush administration will en@@ act policies to strengthen the us economy : a tax cut that might made minimal sense when it seemed that the us had a multi-@@ tril@@ lion dollar surplus no longer makes any sense at all .
the b@@ ush administration should admit this , and re@@ design a tax program to strengthen the economy by making the country live within its means .
president b@@ ush could even stabili@@ ze the economy , offering better unemployment benefits to provide needed stimulus if the down@@ turn continues .
ameri@@ ca is strong , and the global economy is strong .
should the disastrous events con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated here occur , a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ash@@ es .
down@@ turns , of course , can never be fully prevented . we can , however , decrease their frequency ; we can make them shal@@ lower ; we can ensure that fewer people are h@@ urt and that those that get h@@ urt are better protected .
sad@@ ly , we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences .
a double-@@ di@@ p recession for the us ?
last winter , ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s central bank - the federal reserve - was busy pat@@ ting itself on the back .
the fed &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s cut in its basic interest rate to 1.@@ 75 % per year seemed to have worked : the recession was ending .
despite so@@ ber@@ ed expectations about the high-@@ tech revolution &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s impact on productivity and profits , as well as the j@@ it@@ ters inspired by the terror attack on the world trade center , ameri@@ can businesses , it was believed , would soon start investing again big@@ -@@ time because borro@@ wing money at 1.@@ 75 % was too good a deal to pass up .
by late spring , those expectations had dis@@ integrated alongside the collapse of en@@ ron , wor@@ ld@@ com , and ar@@ thur ander@@ sen .
suddenly , everyone doub@@ ted the integrity of the financial accounts of ameri@@ can companies .
suddenly , everyone saw just how much ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s system of corporate surveillance and control had deterior@@ ated during the bub@@ ble of the 1990s .
the ameri@@ can stock market fell 15-@@ 20 % below its winter levels .
spre@@ ads between the interest rate at which ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s government could bor@@ row and the interest rates at which ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s corporations could bor@@ row wi@@ dened .
suddenly , the fed stopped congratulating itself : a 1.@@ 75 % interest rate might be the right interest rate to fuel a recovery when the do@@ w-@@ j@@ ones stock market index stands at 10,000 , but not when the do@@ w-@@ j@@ ones index stands at 8,@@ 500 .
throughout the summer , corporate investment news remained dis@@ appointing .
more and more an@@ al@@ yst@@ s began to speak about the possibility of a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; double di@@ p &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; recession .
yet throughout all this , the federal reserve remained passive .
only in mid-@@ aug@@ ust did the fed hin@@ t that interest rates might be cut .
the informal and un@@ official r@@ ationale le@@ aking out of the fed for its in@@ action had two parts .
first , short-term interest rates were already so low that everyone would see further cuts as temporary only .
they would thus have little effect on the lon@@ ger-@@ term rates that really drive business investment .
second , short-term interest rates were so low that additional cuts would sp@@ ook the financial markets : if even the fed thought conditions warran@@ ted cuts , the argument went , businesses would respond not by increasing their investments but by reducing them .
the fed &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s judgment appeared to be that it was largely ( if not completely ) power@@ less : it had done all that it could , and the le@@ vers of monetary policy were no longer strongly connected to determining the level of economic activity .
so the us in 2002 joined jap@@ an in what economists have for six@@ ty-@@ five years called a liquidity tra@@ p : a situation in which the short-term nomin@@ al interest rates the central bank controls are so low and so loo@@ sely connected to the level of aggreg@@ ate demand that further reductions are in@@ effective in fighting a recession .
ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s situation was not unique : jap@@ an had been in been in thr@@ all to a liquidity tra@@ p since the mid-@@ 1990s .
but there had been no other examples since the great de@@ pression of the 19@@ 30@@ s .
whether ameri@@ ca now really is in a liquidity tra@@ p is uncertain . how long this state of affairs will last is unknown .
nevertheless , even if ameri@@ ca is only on the edge of a liquidity tra@@ p , and even if it moves away from the current state of affairs soon , this is a fri@@ gh@@ tening situation .
if monetary policy is not effective , the only le@@ ver the ameri@@ can government has to manage its economy is fiscal policy : changes in the government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s tax and spending plans to change the government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s direct contribution to aggreg@@ ate demand .
but the lesson of the decades since world war ii is that the us government - with its complex , baro@@ que , eigh@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century organization - is inc@@ ap@@ able of changing policy fast enough to make effective use of fiscal policy as a tool for managing the economy .
it simply takes too long for changes in taxes and spending to work their way through congress and the bureaucracy .
an ameri@@ ca caught in a liquidity tra@@ p is , quite simply , a country with no effective tools of macroeconomic management .
there have been two eras since world war ii when policymakers - ameri@@ can policymakers , at least - believed that they had solved the ri@@ ddle of the business cycle and had learned how to manage a modern industrial or post-@@ industrial economy .
the first was the ke@@ yn@@ esian high-@@ water mark of confidence in demand management of the 196@@ 0s .
it was destroyed by the inflation of the vi@@ et@@ nam era and the o@@ il-@@ price sho@@ cks of the 1970s .
the second was the decade of successful busin@@ ess-@@ cycle management by al@@ an gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s independent , a@@ political , and te@@ chno@@ c@@ ratic fed during the 1990s .
this second era now appears to have been as fle@@ eting as the first .
eigh@@ ty years ago , j@@ oh@@ n ma@@ yn@@ ard ke@@ yn@@ es argued that governments needed to take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability - that the pre-@@ world war i gold standard had not been the golden age people thought it was , and that its successes were the result of a lu@@ cky combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated .
ke@@ yn@@ es was an optim@@ ist in belie@@ ving that governments could learn to manage the business cycle .
he would be sho@@ cked to look at today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s world : a europ@@ e with stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly high unemployment , a jap@@ an mi@@ red in a decade of near stag@@ nation , and now an ameri@@ ca lacking the policy tools to deal with any additional un@@ expected economic bad news .
a dut@@ ch treat for bra@@ zi@@ l ?
bra@@ zi@@ l &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s successful return to the financial markets at the end of ap@@ ri@@ l and the strengthening of the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s currency , the real , have shown that the election of president lu@@ iz in@@ á@@ cio da sil@@ va ( l@@ ula ) has not led to a collapse of foreign confidence .
but nor do recent positive developments eliminate the need for structural economic reforms .
l@@ ula recogni@@ zes that progress in this area , including labor market reform , is critical if bra@@ zi@@ l is to grow sufficiently to allow him to carry on his ambitious social agenda .
how l@@ ula , a former metal worker and founder of cut , which also represents most automobile workers , manages relations with the trade unions will be critical .
recent strikes by car workers at general mo@@ tors , ren@@ ault , vol@@ vo , and ford factories in bra@@ zi@@ l do not aug@@ ur well .
proposed social security and tax reforms , presented to congress at the end of ap@@ ri@@ l , seem to be creating additional tension .
l@@ ula should look to europ@@ e for examples of how to achieve high rates of growth and job creation yet maintain social protection .
europ@@ e also can provide a road@@ map for politicians determined to move from being anti-@@ market le@@ ft-@@ wing@@ ers in opposition to reform@@ -@@ minded stat@@ es@@ men holding power .
sp@@ ain &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fe@@ li@@ pe gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez and b@@ rit@@ ain &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ton@@ y bla@@ ir both made that journey .
but a better example may be wi@@ m kok , who step@@ ped down last year after eight years as dut@@ ch prime minister .
both l@@ ula and kok share the unusual distinction of becoming heads of government after serving as trade union leaders .
during his ten@@ ure as a union leader in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the dut@@ ch economy experienced prolong@@ ed mal@@ a@@ is@@ e-@@ -@@ stag@@ n@@ ant growth , high unemployment , pro@@ hibi@@ tive interest rates , and low corporate profit@@ ability .
large fiscal deficits crow@@ ded out private investment .
hol@@ land &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s problems were mainly structural , although a cyc@@ lical economic down@@ turn made matters worse .
by 1982 , the situation had deterior@@ ated to the point that the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; social partners &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; in the dut@@ ch tri@@ parti@@ te system ( government , business , and trade unions ) concluded that combating the crisis required a break with the past .
the defining moment came with the w@@ assen@@ a@@ ar agreement of that year@@ --@@ a pact between employers and trade unions , reached with the active encouragement of government .
trade unions agreed to moderate wage claims and abandon wage index@@ ation , in exchange for reduced working time and improved prospects for the future .
the increased flexibility of the dut@@ ch labor market eventually restored priv@@ ate-@@ sector profit@@ ability and led to rapid job creation , among the highest in europ@@ e and comparable to the rate in the us .
a pru@@ dent fiscal stance , pursued while the economy recovered and interest rates fell , created room for big cuts in taxes and social contributions .
with lower inflation , this raised workers &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; real dis@@ pos@@ able income , enabling trade union leaders to demonstrate to their members that wage moder@@ ation worked and was in their interest .
the recent , much weaker , performance of the dut@@ ch economy is largely explained by strong wage increases , which under@@ mined competitiveness and contributed to job ext@@ inc@@ tion .
this promp@@ ted kok to call last year@@ --@@ on the 20th anniversary of the w@@ assen@@ a@@ ar accord@@ --@@ for a new pact among the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s social partners .
he will soon have a europ@@ e@@ an-@@ wide platform to deliver his message of wage moder@@ ation and lab@@ or-@@ market flexibility through his assign@@ ment to brea@@ the new life into the eu employment strategy .
how is the w@@ assen@@ a@@ ar model relevant to bra@@ zi@@ l ?
not unlike hol@@ land in the early 1980s , bra@@ zi@@ l &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth am@@ id fiscal constraints and high interest rates .
while bra@@ zi@@ l &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s registered unemployment rate is not very high by regional standards , its fast growing labor force requires a high rate of job creation .
em@@ ul@@ ating the dut@@ ch experience with job creation provides the su@@ rest possible path to allevi@@ ating poverty in bra@@ zi@@ l .
the idea is not that bra@@ zi@@ l should seek to implement the dut@@ ch soci@@ al-@@ economic model@@ --@@ the countries are too different for that .
but l@@ ula can and should follow kok &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s example and use his trade union connections , as well as his rap@@ port with the working class , to achieve a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvement in bra@@ zi@@ l &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s overall economic performance and re@@ alizing its potential to become l@@ atin ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economic power@@ house .
bra@@ zi@@ l has benefited from an improvement in market sen@@ timent and financial indicators since l@@ ula &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s election .
this would give the authorities room to address the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s da@@ un@@ ting lon@@ ger-@@ term policy agen@@ da@@ --@@ including a major reform of the costly pension system , an over@@ hau@@ l of the tax system , and strengthening the bankrupt@@ cy fra@@ me@@ work@@ --@@ that bra@@ zi@@ l must face in order to boost competitiveness .
l@@ ula &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s country@@ men , who elected him overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , need rapid economic growth and job creation .
that will happen only if l@@ ula comple@@ tes a successful transformation from anti-@@ market trade union leader into a stat@@ es@@ man judi@@ ci@@ ously bl@@ ending economic and social reform .
success would benefit not only bra@@ zi@@ l , but have a strong demonstration effect across l@@ atin ameri@@ ca .
a global &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; new deal &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ?
ath@@ ens – the international monetary fund ’ s bel@@ ated admission that it significantly under@@ estimated the damage that austerity would do to europ@@ ean union growth rates highlights the self-@@ defe@@ ating character of “ orthodo@@ x ” recip@@ es to address the causes of the debt crisis that followed the financial crash of 2008-@@ 2009 .
conventional theory suggests that a single country ( or group of countries ) consoli@@ dating its finances can expect lower interest rates , a weaker currency , and an improved trade position .
but , because this cannot happen for all major economies simultaneously – one country ’ s ( or group of countries ’ ) austerity implies less demand for other countries ’ products – such policies eventually lead to beg@@ gar@@ -@@ th@@ y-@@ neigh@@ bor situations .
indeed , it was this dynamic – against which j@@ oh@@ n ma@@ yn@@ ard ke@@ yn@@ es fought – that made the great de@@ pression of the 1930 ’ s so gri@@ m .
today ’ s problems are compo@@ unded by a lack of sufficient private demand – particularly household consumption – in the advanced economies to compensate for demand losses stem@@ ming from austerity .
during the last two decades , consumption dro@@ ve these countries ’ economic growth , reaching histor@@ ically high g@@ d@@ p shares .
moreover , major advanced economies , such as the united states , ger@@ many , and jap@@ an , face lon@@ ger-@@ term fiscal problems in the form of aging populations or over@@ size welfare states , limiting their capacity to contribute to demand management .
recent moves to ease monetary policy have been a step in the right direction ; but , so far , they have not proved to be a game chan@@ ger .
for domestic demand to act as an engine of growth , policies should shift resources from investment to consumption .
while the mag@@ nit@@ u@@ des involved are huge , they must be at@@ tained if an extended period of low growth , high unemployment , and declining living standards among the world ’ s poorest is to be avoided .
international economic policy coordination should be significantly strengthened in order to deal effectively with changes on such a scale .
start with europ@@ e .
it is by now pat@@ ently obvious that austerity and domestic reforms are not enough to pull the eurozone ’ s peripher@@ y out of deep recession .
growing awareness of the failure of current policies is causing social dis@@ content , civil dis@@ order , and political instability , with the recently concluded itali@@ an elections and the growing popular resistance to gre@@ ek reform efforts serving as a b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther .
returning the eurozone ’ s peripheral economies to the path of growth requires more than structural reforms and fiscal consolidation .
it also requires a substantial reform of the monetary union ’ s system of economic governance , aimed at restoring financial stability and lower@@ ing borro@@ wing costs , together with a boost in external demand in order to compensate for the effects of austerity .
reforming governance implies significant progress toward economic unification : centr@@ alizing europ@@ ean debt through euro@@ bonds , mobi@@ liz@@ ing sufficient rescue funds , allowing the europ@@ ean central bank to intervene in the primary bond markets , and establishing both a fiscal and a banking union .
this is a t@@ all order , in view of the reluc@@ tance of most eu member states to ce@@ de competences to europ@@ ean institutions .
but europ@@ e should move more decisi@@ vely in this direction .
otherwise , speculation on member states ’ national debt will pers@@ ist , keeping borro@@ wing costs at levels that are in@@ consistent with the conditions required to sustain economic recovery .
concerning external demand , in@@ tra-@@ europ@@ ean help in the form of re@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary policies in stronger economies is unlikely to prove sufficient , owing primarily to the fiscal and political conditions prev@@ ailing in ger@@ many .
implementing a mar@@ shall plan@@ -@@ type initiative by mobi@@ liz@@ ing eu budget resources and additional lending by the europ@@ ean investment bank to finance investments in weaker countries could be an alternative , but it lacks political support .
on a global scale , neither the us nor jap@@ an is in a position to provide significant external stimulus .
only the emerging and developing economies of a@@ sia could effectively contribute to lifting global demand through a coordinated effort aimed at boosting domestic consumption , which , in turn , would stimulate additional investment .
recent im@@ f experience suggests that , through appropriate coordination , private funds could be mobili@@ zed for big priv@@ ate-@@ public partnership projects linking demand expansion with infrastructure investment .
in other words , a global “ new deal ” – combining policies designed to achieve an order@@ ly real@@ ign@@ ment of consumption and investment worldwide – seems to be required .
the advanced economies should promote produc@@ tiv@@ ity-@@ enhancing structural reforms with renewed vig@@ or .
the eurozone should solidi@@ fy its currency union .
and the emerging and developing economies should support domestic sources of growth .
for such a deal to become possible , certain pre@@ conditions must be met .
first , international policy coordination by the g-@@ 20 must be tigh@@ tened by creating a permanent secret@@ ariat to make policy proposals and recommendations concerning macroeconomic and financial developments .
the secret@@ ariat should actively cooperate with the im@@ f to benefit from its analysis , notably regarding exchange rates .
second , global financial reform must proceed at a faster pace .
the financial sector requires tou@@ gher regulation , strengthened supervision , and internationally consistent resolution mechanisms to address the problems posed by very large , global institutions that are considered too big ( or too complex ) to fail .
such reform is essential if the international financial system is to medi@@ ate the si@@ ze@@ able resource transfers that will underp@@ in the required changes in the structure of global demand .
finally , a new trade pact – possibly , but not necessarily , within the do@@ ha round – is needed to ensure the major trading powers ’ access to foreign markets .
this is critic@@ ally important for inspir@@ ing confidence in asi@@ an countries , which might be persu@@ aded to favor domestic , as opposed to external , sources of demand .
moreover , trade liberalization will also increase consumer confidence worldwide .
the time is right for a new global settlement that targets growth , addresses crisis conditions in certain parts of the world , and re@@ balances the global economy to set it back on a path of strong and steady growth .
the other financial crisis
new@@ port beach – two vari@@ ants of financial crisis continue to w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c on western economies , fu@@ eling job@@ less@@ ness and poverty : the one that we read about regularly in newspapers , involving governments around the world ; and a less visible one at the level of small and medium-@@ size businesses and households .
the sovereign@@ -@@ debt crisis is well known .
while sovereign credit quality has deterior@@ ated virtually across the board , and will most probably continue to do so , the implications for individual countries vary .
some western countries – such as gre@@ ece – had fragile government accounts from the outset and ti@@ pped quickly into persistent crisis mode .
there they remain , still failing to provide citizens with a light at the end of what already has been a long tunnel .
other countries had been fis@@ cally responsible , but were overwhel@@ med by the li@@ abilities that they had assumed from others ( for example , i@@ reland ’ s ir@@ responsible banks s@@ ank their budget ) .
still others , including the united states , faced no immediate threat but failed to make progress on lon@@ ger-@@ term issues . a few , like ger@@ many , had built deep economic and financial re@@ sili@@ ence through years of fiscal discipline and structural reforms .
it is not surprising that policy approaches have also varied .
indeed , they have shared only one , albeit crucial ( and dis@@ appointing ) feature : the in@@ ability to rely on rapid growth as the “ saf@@ est ” way to dele@@ verage an over-@@ in@@ deb@@ ted economy .
gre@@ ece essentially def@@ aul@@ ted on some obligations .
i@@ reland opted for austerity and reforms , as has the united king@@ dom .
the us is gradually transfer@@ ring resources from credi@@ tors to deb@@ tors through financial repression .
and ger@@ many is slowly acqui@@ es@@ cing to a pru@@ dent relative expansion in domestic demand .
so much for the sovereign@@ -@@ debt crisis , which , given its national , regional , and global impact , has been particularly well covered .
after all , sovereig@@ ns are called that because they have the power to impose taxes , regulations , and , at the extreme , conf@@ is@@ cation .
but the other credit crisis is equally consequ@@ ential , and receives much less attention , even as it ero@@ des societies ’ integrity , productive capabilities , and ability to maintain living standards ( particularly for the least fortunate ) .
i know of very few western countries where small and medium-@@ size companies , as well as mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income households and those of more limited means , have not experienced a significant decline in their access to credit – not just new financing , but also the ability to roll over old credit lines and loans .
the immediate causes are well known .
they range from sub@@ du@@ ed bank lending to un@@ usually high risk a@@ version , and from dis@@ credi@@ ted credit vehicles to the withdrawal of some institutions from credit intermedi@@ ation altogether .
such credit constraints are one reason why unemployment rates continue to rise in so many countries – often from already alarming levels , such as 25 % in gre@@ ece and sp@@ ain ( where youth unemployment is above 50 % ) – and why unemployment remains un@@ usually high in countries like the us ( albeit it at a much lower level ) .
this is not just a matter of lost capabilities and rising poverty ; persist@@ ently high unemployment also leads to social un@@ rest , ero@@ sion of trust in political leaders and institutions , and the mounting risk of a lost generation .
indeed , unemployment data in many advanced countries are dominated by long-term job@@ less@@ ness ( usually defined as six months or more ) . skill ero@@ sion becomes a problem for those with prior work experience , while un@@ successful first-@@ time ent@@ rants into the labor force are not just unemployed , but risk becoming un@@ emplo@@ yable .
governments are doing too little to address the private credit deb@@ ac@@ le .
argu@@ ably , they must first sort out the sovereign side of the crisis ; but it is not clear that most officials even have a comprehensive plan .
policy asymmet@@ ry is greatest for the countries most ac@@ utely affected by the sovereign@@ -@@ debt crisis .
there , the private sector has essentially been left to f@@ end for itself ; and most households and companies are strug@@ gling , thus fu@@ eling continued economic imp@@ lo@@ sion .
other countries appear to have adopted a “ field of dreams ” – also known as “ build it and they will come ” – approach to private credit markets , in the us , for example , arti@@ fici@@ ally low interest rates for home mort@@ g@@ ages , resulting from the federal reserve ’ s policy activis@@ m , are supposed to ki@@ ck-@@ start pru@@ dent financing .
the europ@@ ean central bank is taking a simil@@ arly indirect approach .
in both places , other policy@@ making entities , with much better tools at their disposal , appear either un@@ willing or unable to play their part .
as such , action by central banks will repeatedly fail to gain sufficient tra@@ ction .
in fact , only the uk is visi@@ bly op@@ ting for a more coordinated and direct way to counter the persistent short@@ falls stem@@ ming from the private part of the credit crisis .
there , the “ funding for lending scheme , ” jointly designed by the bank of eng@@ land and the treas@@ ury , seeks “ to boost the incentive for banks and building societies to lend to uk households and non-@@ financial companies , ” while holding them accountable for proper behavior .
the uk example is important ; but , given the scope and scale of the challenges , the proposal is a relatively modest one .
the program may stimulate some productive credit intermedi@@ ation , but it will not make a significant dent in what will remain one of the major obstacles to robust economic recovery .
proper access to credit for productive segments is an integral part of a well-@@ functioning economy .
without it , growth fal@@ ters , job creation is insufficient , and wi@@ dening income and wealth inequality under@@ mines the social fabric .
that is why any comprehensive approach to restoring the advanced countries ’ economic and financial vibran@@ cy must target the proper revi@@ val of private credit flows .
toxic politics ver@@ sus better economics
new y@@ or@@ k – the relationship between politics and economics is changing .
adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country politicians are locked in bizar@@ re , often toxic , conflicts , instead of acting on a growing economic consensus about how to escape a pro@@ trac@@ ted period of low and un@@ equal growth .
this trend must be revers@@ ed , before it struc@@ tur@@ ally crip@@ ples the advanced world and swe@@ ep@@ s up the emerging economies , too .
obviously , political inf@@ igh@@ ting is nothing new .
but , until recently , the expec@@ tation was that if professional economists achieved a te@@ chno@@ c@@ ratic consensus on a given policy approach , political leaders would listen .
even when more radical political parties attempted to push a different agenda , powerful forces – whether moral su@@ asion from g@@ 7 governments , private capital markets , or the condi@@ tionality attached to international monetary fund and world bank lending – would almost always ensure that the consensus approach eventually won the day .
in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s , for example , the so-called wash@@ ington consensus dominated policy@@ making in much of the world , with everyone from the united states to a multitude of emerging economies pursuing trade liberalization , privati@@ zation , greater use of price mechanisms , finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector dereg@@ ulation , and fiscal and monetary reforms with a heavy sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ side emphasis .
the embra@@ ce of the wash@@ ington consensus by multilateral institutions amp@@ li@@ fied its transmission , helping to drive forward the broader process of economic and financial globalization .
incoming governments – particularly those led by non-@@ traditional movements , which had risen to power on the back of domestic un@@ ease and frustr@@ ation with main@@ stream parties – sometimes dis@@ agreed with the appropri@@ at@@ eness and relevance of the wash@@ ington consensus .
but , as bra@@ zi@@ lian president lu@@ iz in@@ á@@ cio l@@ ula da sil@@ va demonstrated with his famous policy pi@@ vo@@ t in 2002 , that consensus ten@@ ded largely to prevail .
and it continued to hold s@@ way as recently as almost two years ago , when gre@@ ek prime minister al@@ ex@@ is t@@ si@@ pr@@ as executed an equally notable u@@ -@@ turn .
but after years of un@@ usually s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish and stri@@ k@@ ingly non-@@ inclusive growth , the consensus is breaking down .
adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ country citizens are frustr@@ ated with an “ establishment ” – including economic “ experts , ” main@@ stream political leaders , and dominant multinational companies – which they increasingly blame for their economic trav@@ ails .
anti-@@ establishment movements and figures have been quick to sei@@ ze on this frustr@@ ation , using infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory and even comb@@ ative rhetoric to win support .
they do not even have to win elections to dis@@ rupt the transmission mechanism between economics and politics .
the united king@@ dom proved that in jun@@ e , with its bre@@ x@@ it vote – a decision that directly de@@ fied the broad economic consensus that remaining within the europ@@ ean union was in b@@ rit@@ ain ’ s best interest .
the referendum happened for one reason : in 2013 , th@@ en-@@ prime minister da@@ vi@@ d cam@@ eron fe@@ ared that he would be unable to secure sufficiently his conservative party base in the general election that year .
so he p@@ ander@@ ed to euro@@ skep@@ tic voters with the promise of a referendum . the source of cam@@ eron ’ s fear ?
the political dis@@ ruption caused by the uk independence party – an anti-@@ establishment party that ended up winning only one seat in parliament and subsequently found itself lea@@ der@@ less and in tur@@ mo@@ il .
now , it seems , the floo@@ d@@ g@@ ates have opened .
at the recent conservative party annual conference , speeches by prime minister ther@@ esa may and members of her cab@@ inet revealed an intention to pursue a “ hard bre@@ x@@ it , ” thereby disman@@ tling trading arrangements that have served the economy well .
they also included attacks on “ international el@@ ites ” and criticism of bank of eng@@ land policies that were instru@@ mental in stabili@@ zing the bri@@ tish economy in the referendum ’ s immediate after@@ math – thus giving may ’ s new government time to formul@@ ate a coherent bre@@ x@@ it strategy .
several other advanced economies are experiencing an@@ alog@@ ous political developments .
in ger@@ many , a sur@@ pris@@ ingly strong showing by the far-@@ right alternative für deutsch@@ land in recent state elections already appears to be affecting the government ’ s behavior .
in the us , even if don@@ ald tru@@ mp ’ s presidential campaign fails to put a re@@ publi@@ can back in the white house ( as appears increasingly likely , given that , in the latest tw@@ ist of this highly unusual campaign , many re@@ publi@@ can leaders have now ren@@ ounced their party ’ s nom@@ ine@@ e ) , his candi@@ d@@ acy will likely leave a lasting impact on ameri@@ can politics .
if not managed well , ital@@ y ’ s constitutional referendum in dec@@ ember – a ris@@ ky bid by prime minister mat@@ te@@ o r@@ enz@@ i to consolidate support – could back@@ fire , just like cam@@ eron ’ s referendum did , causing political dis@@ ruption and undermining effective action to address the country ’ s economic challenges .
make no mistake : solid and credible policy options are available .
after years of medi@@ oc@@ re economic performance , there is widespread agreement that a shift away from excessive dependence on un@@ conventional monetary policy is needed .
as im@@ f managing director christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de put it , “ central banks cannot be the only game in town . ”
and yet they have been .
as i argue in the only game in town , published in jan@@ u@@ ary , countries need a more comprehensive policy approach , involving pro-@@ growth structural reforms , more balanced demand management ( including higher fiscal spending on infrastructure ) , and better cross-border policy coordination and architecture .
there is also a need , highlighted by the pro@@ trac@@ ted gre@@ ek crisis , to address po@@ ckets of severe over-@@ in@@ deb@@ te@@ dness , which can have cr@@ ush@@ ing impact extending well beyond the directly affected .
the emergence of a new consensus on these points is good news .
but , in the current political environment , transl@@ ating that consensus into action is likely to happen too slowly , at best .
the risk is that , as bad politics crow@@ ds out good economics , popular anger and frustr@@ ation will rise , making politics even more toxic .
one hopes that en@@ ligh@@ tened political leadership takes the re@@ ins in time to make the needed mid-@@ course correc@@ tions volun@@ tar@@ ily , before un@@ ambiguous signs of economic and financial crisis force policymakers to scra@@ m@@ ble to minim@@ ize the damage .
another lesson from jap@@ an
new haven – yet another in a long string of negative inflation sur@@ prises is at hand .
in the united states , the so-called core c@@ pi ( consumer price index ) – which exclu@@ des food and energy – has headed down just when it was supposed to be going up .
over the three months ending in may , the core c@@ pi was basically unchanged , holding , at just 1.@@ 7 % above its year-@@ earlier level .
for a us economy that is widely presu@@ med to be ne@@ aring the hal@@ lowed ground of full employment , this comes as a ru@@ de aw@@ ak@@ ening – particularly for the federal reserve , which has pul@@ led out all the stops to get inflation back to its 2 % target .
hal@@ f@@ way around the world , a similar story continues to play out in jap@@ an .
but , for the de@@ fl@@ ation-@@ pr@@ one jap@@ anese economy , it ’ s a much tou@@ gher story .
through ap@@ ri@@ l , jap@@ an ’ s core c@@ pi was basically flat relative to its year-@@ earlier level , with a similar outcome evident in may for the to@@ k@@ yo metro@@ politan area .
for the bank of jap@@ an ( bo@@ j ) , which committed an unprecedented ar@@ senal of un@@ conventional policy weapons to arrest a 19@@ -@@ year stretch of 16.@@ 5 % de@@ flation lasting from 1994 to 2013 , this is more than just a ru@@ de aw@@ ak@@ ening .
it is an embar@@ rass@@ ment bor@@ dering on defeat .
this story is global in scope .
yes , there are a few notable out@@ liers – namely , the united king@@ dom , where currency pressures and one-@@ off holiday distortions are temporarily boosting core inflation to 2.4 % , and mal@@ ay@@ sia , where the removal of fuel subsidies has boo@@ sted head@@ line inflation , yet left the core stable at around 2.5 % .
but they are exceptions in an otherwise infl@@ ation@@ less world .
the international monetary fund ’ s latest forecasts bear this out .
not@@ with@@ standing a modest fir@@ ming of global economic growth , inflation in the advanced economies is expected to average slightly less than 2 % in 201@@ 7-@@ 201@@ 8 .
the first chapter of this t@@ ale was written many years ago , in jap@@ an .
from asset bub@@ bles and excess leverage to currency sup@@ pression and productivity im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , jap@@ an ’ s experience – with lost decades now stret@@ ching to a quar@@ ter-@@ century – is te@@ sta@@ ment to all that can go wrong in large and weal@@ thy economies .
but no lesson is more profound than that of a series of policy bl@@ under@@ s made by the bo@@ j .
not only did reck@@ less monetary accommodation set the stage for jap@@ an ’ s dem@@ ise ; the country ’ s central bank compo@@ unded the problem by taking policy rates to the zero bound ( and even lower ) , embra@@ cing quantitative eas@@ ing , and manipul@@ ating long-term interest rates in the hopes of revi@@ ving the economy .
this has created an un@@ healthy dependen@@ cy from which there is no easy exit .
though jap@@ an ’ s experience since the early 1990s provides many lessons , the rest of the world has failed mis@@ er@@ ably at he@@ eding them .
volumes have been written , countless sym@@ posi@@ ums have been held , and famous promises have been made by the li@@ kes of former us fed chairman ben ber@@ n@@ an@@ ke never to repeat jap@@ an ’ s mistakes .
yet time and again , other major central banks – especially the fed and the europ@@ ean central bank – have been quick to follow , with equally di@@ re consequences .
the inflation surprise of 2017 offers three key in@@ sights .
first , the relationship between inflation and economic s@@ lack – the so-called ph@@ illi@@ ps cur@@ ve – has broken down .
cour@@ tes@@ y of what the university of gen@@ eva ’ s rich@@ ard bal@@ d@@ win calls the “ second un@@ bund@@ ling ” of globalization , the world is aw@@ ash in the excess supply of increasingly frag@@ mented global supply chains .
out@@ sourcing via these supply chains dramatically exp@@ ands the el@@ as@@ tic@@ ity of the global supply cur@@ ve , fundamentally alter@@ ing the concept of s@@ lack in labor and product markets , as well as the pressure such s@@ lack might put on inflation .
second , today ’ s globalization is inher@@ ently asymmet@@ ric .
for a variety of reasons – han@@ go@@ vers from bal@@ ance-@@ sheet rec@@ essions in jap@@ an and the us , f@@ ear@@ -@@ driven precautionary saving in ch@@ ina , and an@@ em@@ ic consumption in produc@@ tiv@@ ity-@@ constra@@ ined europ@@ e – the demand side of most major economies remains severely im@@ pa@@ ired .
ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed against a backdrop of ever-@@ expanding supply , the resulting im@@ balance is inher@@ ently de@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary .
third , central banks are all but power@@ less to cope with the moving target of what can be called a non-@@ station@@ ary liquidity tra@@ p .
first observed by j@@ oh@@ n ma@@ yn@@ ard ke@@ yn@@ es during the great de@@ pression of the 19@@ 30@@ s , the liquidity tra@@ p describes a situation in which policy interest rates , having reached the zero bound , are unable to stimulate chron@@ ically defici@@ ent aggreg@@ ate demand .
sound familiar ?
the novel tw@@ ist today is the ever-@@ expanding global supply cur@@ ve .
that makes today ’ s central banks even more im@@ po@@ tent than they were in the 19@@ 30@@ s .
this is not an inc@@ ur@@ able disease .
in a world of hyper@@ -@@ globalization – bar@@ ring a protection@@ ist rela@@ p@@ se led by the ameri@@ ca fir@@ sters – treatment needs to be focused on the demand side of the equ@@ ation .
the most important lesson from the 19@@ 30@@ s , as well as from the modern@@ -@@ day jap@@ anese experience , is that monetary policy provides no answer for a chronic defici@@ ency of aggreg@@ ate demand .
addressing it is a task primarily for fiscal authorities .
the idea that central banks should consider making a new promise to raise their inflation targets is hardly credible .
in the meantime , fed chair jan@@ et y@@ ellen is right ( finally ) to push the fed to norm@@ alize policy , putting an end to a failed experiment that has long out@@ lived its use@@ fulness .
the danger all along has been that open-@@ ended un@@ conventional monetary eas@@ ing would fail to achieve tra@@ ction in the real economy , and would in@@ ject excess liquidity into us and global financial markets that could lead to asset bub@@ bles , reck@@ less risk taking , and the next crisis .
moreover , because un@@ conventional eas@@ ing was a strategy designed for an emergency that no longer exists , it leaves the fed with no amm@@ uni@@ tion to fight the inevitable next down@@ turn and crisis .
we ignore history at great peri@@ l .
the latest dis@@ appointment for infl@@ ation-@@ targeting central banks is really not a surprise after all .
the same is true of the related drop in long-term interest rates .
there is much to be gained by studying carefully the lessons of jap@@ an .
cam@@ bridge – earlier this year , the consensus view among economists was that the united states would out@@ strip its adv@@ anc@@ ed-@@ economy ri@@ vals .
but the most notable positive economic news of 2017 among the developed countries has been coming from europ@@ e .
last week , the international monetary fund revised up@@ ward its growth projec@@ tions for the eurozone , with the more favor@@ able outlook extending broadly across member countries and including the big four : ger@@ many , fran@@ ce , ital@@ y , and sp@@ ain .
im@@ f chief econom@@ ist mau@@ rice ob@@ st@@ feld characterized recent developments in the global economy as a “ fir@@ ming recovery . ”
growth is also expected to pick up in a@@ sia ’ s advanced economies , including jap@@ an .
as i noted in a previous com@@ mentary , ic@@ eland , where the financial crisis dates to 2007 , has already been dealing with a fresh wave of capital in@@ flows for some time , leading to concerns about potential over@@ heating .
a few days ago , gre@@ ece , the most batter@@ ed of europ@@ e ’ s crisis countries , was able to tap global financial markets for the first time in years .
with a yield of more than 4.@@ 6 % , gre@@ ece ’ s bonds were enthusias@@ tically sn@@ apped up by institutional investors .
gre@@ ek and europ@@ ean officials ha@@ iled the bond sale as a milestone for a country that had lost access to global capital markets back in 2010 .
gre@@ ek prime minister al@@ ex@@ is t@@ si@@ pr@@ as said the debt issue was a sign that his country is on the path to a definitive end to its prolong@@ ed crisis .
in the us , the federal reserve ’ s ongoing exit from ultra-@@ easy post-@@ crisis monetary policy adds to the sense among market participants and other countries ’ policymakers that normal times are returning .
do recent positive developments in the advanced countries , which were at the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the global financial crisis of 2008 , mean that the brutal after@@ math of that crisis is finally over ?
good news not@@ with@@ standing , declar@@ ing victory at this stage ( even a decade later ) appears pre@@ mature .
recovery is not the same as resolution .
it may be instruc@@ tive to recall that in other pro@@ trac@@ ted post-@@ crisis episo@@ des , including the great de@@ pression of the 19@@ 30@@ s , economic recovery without resolution of the fundamental problems of excessive leverage and weak banks usually proved shal@@ low and difficult to sustain .
during the “ lost decade ” of the l@@ atin ameri@@ can debt crisis in the 1980s , bra@@ zi@@ l and m@@ ex@@ ico had a significant and promising growth pi@@ ck@@ up in 198@@ 4-@@ 1985 – before serious problems in the banking sector , an un@@ resolved external debt over@@ hang , and several ill-@@ advised domestic policy initiatives cut those recover@@ ies short .
the post-@@ crisis legacy was finally sha@@ ken off only several years later with the restoration of fiscal sustainability , debt writ@@ e-@@ off@@ s under the so-called bra@@ dy plan , and a variety of domestic structural reforms .
since its 1992 banking crisis , jap@@ an has suffered several false starts .
there were recover@@ ies in 199@@ 5-@@ 1996 and again in 2000 and 2010 ; but they ten@@ ded to be cut short by the failure to write down bad debt ( the so-called z@@ om@@ bie loans ) , several pre@@ mature policy revers@@ als , and an increasingly un@@ sustainable acc@@ um@@ ulation of government debt .
the eurozone emerged from the financial crisis in 2008-@@ 2009 with some economic momentum .
unlike the federal reserve , however , the europ@@ ean central bank hi@@ ked interest rates in early 2011 , which contributed to the region ’ s des@@ cent into a deeper crisis .
history , therefore , suggests cau@@ tion before concluding that the current recovery has the ma@@ k@@ ings of a more sustainable and broad@@ -based variety .
many of the economic problems created or exacerb@@ ated by the crisis remain un@@ resolved .
all of the advanced economies ( to varying degrees ) have significant legacy debts ( public and private ) from the exc@@ esses that set the stage for the financial crisis , as well as from the prolong@@ ed impact of the crisis on the real economy .
low interest rates have e@@ ased the burden of those debts ( in effect , negative real interest rates are a tax on bon@@ d@@ holders ) , but rates are on the rise .
political pol@@ ari@@ zation in the us and the united king@@ dom is at or near historic high@@ s , depending on the measure used .
as a result , many critical but politically sensitive policies to ensure future fiscal sustainability remain un@@ resolved in both countries .
the uk ’ s withdrawal from the europ@@ ean union – and bre@@ x@@ it ’ s medium-term impact on the bri@@ tish economy – is another source of risk that has yet to be tackled .
how jap@@ an will resolve its public and private debt over@@ hang is yet to be determined .
i have argued elsewhere that inflation will likely be part of that resolution , as it is impro@@ b@@ able that an aging population will vote to raise its tax burden and reduce its benefits sufficiently to put jap@@ an ’ s debt tra@@ jec@@ tory on a sustainable path .
in europ@@ e , the high level of non-@@ performing loans continues to act as a drag on economic growth , by in@@ hibit@@ ing new credit creation .
furthermore , these bad assets pose a substantial contin@@ gent liability for some governments .
tar@@ get@@ 2 , the euro ’ s real-time gross settlement system , has emerged as the eurozone ’ s mechanism for financing the emergence of wi@@ dening structural bal@@ ance-@@ of-@@ payments gaps , whereby capital flows out of southern europ@@ e into ger@@ many .
for gre@@ ece , ital@@ y , portu@@ gal , and sp@@ ain , public-@@ sector debt must now also include the central bank ’ s sharp@@ ly rising debts .
perhaps the main lesson is that even more cau@@ tion is warran@@ ted in deciding whether the time is ri@@ pe to “ norm@@ alize ” monetary policy .
even in the best of recovery scenarios , policymakers would be ill-@@ advised to k@@ ick the can down the road on structural reforms and fiscal measures needed to mitig@@ ate risk premi@@ a .
advise and rel@@ ent
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – dro@@ pping bom@@ bs as a solution to the world ’ s trouble spots may be falling out of fashion ( with the notable exception of li@@ b@@ ya ) , but finger w@@ ag@@ ging is definitely back in .
hardly a day goes by without a major newspaper somewhere in the west offering sage and specific , but often no@@ t-@@ so-@@ friendly , advice to distant strug@@ gling democracies on what they “ must ” do to earn the “ international community ’ s ” appro@@ b@@ ation .
of course , such advice , like much of newspapers themselves nowadays , comes free of charge .
but it is also advice that is free of responsibility , and , as stan@@ ley bal@@ d@@ win once said , power without responsibility is the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ ative of the har@@ lot .
there is a considerable gap between offers of advice one cannot refuse and the responsibility to deal with the consequences when that advice proves wrong or extremely difficult to implement .
the world ’ s advice gi@@ vers might try to keep this in mind when offering to help leaders of distant countries that are grap@@ pling with problems with which the advis@@ er has little or no first-@@ hand experience .
every once in a while , a profession ( most frequently , economics ) determin@@ es that it has reached a consensus on how to solve a problem .
the so-called “ wash@@ ington consensus ” that held s@@ way before the recent financial crisis was a good example .
in the case of nas@@ cent democracies , the formula that is now often made compulsory is this : lift all b@@ ans on political activities , liber@@ alize the media , hold elections ( the sooner , the better ) , resolve all minority issues in favor of the minorities , abandon trade barriers , and rid the country of corruption , prefer@@ ably overnight .
new governments are urged to tackle all of these problems immediately and simultaneously , l@@ est they lose “ momentum ” and begin back@@ sli@@ ding .
how to do this is left up to the new leaders , who are often credi@@ ted with goo@@ dness and powers of persu@@ asion they never had and never will have .
in many cases , the co@@ hesi@@ veness of opposition movements that come to power in the wake of a political up@@ heav@@ al may not be what the international media presu@@ me it to be .
indeed , some components of these so-called “ democratic co@@ ali@@ tions ” may not be democratic at all .
some leaders , such as n@@ elson mand@@ ela , rise to the historic occasion , against all od@@ ds .
others , such as k@@ az@@ akh@@ stan ’ s nur@@ sul@@ tan n@@ az@@ ar@@ ba@@ ye@@ v ( popular with western media when he first came on the scene ) pla@@ in@@ ly has not .
how can we help ensure these movements ’ sustainability in such flu@@ id moments ?
mo@@ dest@@ y is a virtu@@ e in private life .
it should also be a guide in dispens@@ ing political advice .
i would start by keeping in mind that some countries ’ capacity to absor@@ b advice is limited , so it should be offered in smaller por@@ tions .
where to start ?
the most important and potentially su@@ sta@@ ining feature of a new democracy lies in its effort to commit itself to ob@@ serving international hum@@ an-@@ rights standards .
in fact , there is a large body of literature that indicates that even countries in the after@@ math of internal conflict can reach a higher level of compliance with these standards .
but human rights should not be con@@ fl@@ ated with democracy .
while democracy is , no doubt , the form of governance that best pre@@ serves human rights , the two are not the same thing .
human rights will not co-@@ exist with dictatorship , or with any other non-@@ democracy , for long .
setting standards and goals of human rights is a powerful signal that a country is pointing itself in the right direction .
the country is in effect announ@@ cing that it is moving toward democratic institutional arrangements .
the embra@@ ce of essential hum@@ an-@@ rights standards as a corner@@ stone of a country ’ s development is one of our era ’ s semin@@ al innovations .
the notion that a dict@@ ator can claim the sovereign right to abuse his people has become unacceptable .
a country that makes progress on human rights and comm@@ its to the change of behavior required to meet these international standards can also make a decisive turn toward a better future .
we should therefore focus on meeting international hum@@ an-@@ rights standards as a goal that a new democracy “ must ” ( to use a favorite word of western edi@@ torial writers ) move toward quickly .
but we should not conf@@ use these values with the other essential elements of progress , such as establishing liber@@ alized trade regimes , creating institutional structures with a separation of powers , and roo@@ ting out corruption .
these are absolute nec@@ essi@@ ties for democratic success , but they require lon@@ ger-@@ term development of institutional capacity .
corruption , for example , may have cultural ant@@ ec@@ e@@ dents and is part and par@@ cel of institutional weakness .
in most cases , neither can be re@@ medi@@ ed overnight .
above all , we need to show pati@@ ence with the new governments of the countries we hope to see evol@@ ving toward democracy , and avoid the tendency to expect instant grati@@ fication .
a few months of politics will never overcome a few centuries of soci@@ ology .
so , as we watch and wait , we need to be as suppor@@ tive – but not over@@ bearing – as possible .
a europ@@ ean cure for bal@@ kan de@@ pression
vi@@ enn@@ a – europ@@ ean politics is mostly shaped by events and anni@@ vers@@ aries .
but while events are often un@@ fore@@ see@@ able , anni@@ vers@@ aries are not .
five years from now , europ@@ e will be reflecting on the 100@@ th anniversary of the outbreak of world war 1 , which led to a loss of life almost without parallel and set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of europ@@ e as we now know it .
world leaders may have already reserved some days in aug@@ ust 2014 to mark the occasion .
it is easy to pre@@ dict that sar@@ aje@@ vo will be the place where they will meet to look back on europ@@ e ’ s sav@@ age twen@@ tieth century .
but how will sar@@ aje@@ vo look in five years ?
will it still be the capital of a country whose citizens view the future ble@@ ak@@ ly and whose politicians have totally lost touch with the elec@@ torate ?
or is there a hope that europ@@ ean leaders will use the anniversary to announce the successful integration of the remaining bal@@ kan countries into the europ@@ ean union ?
a bal@@ kan monitor survey recently conducted by gall@@ up europ@@ e gives suggests the state of public opinion in ser@@ bia , mon@@ tene@@ gro , mac@@ ed@@ onia , alb@@ ania , cro@@ ati@@ a , bo@@ s@@ nia and herz@@ eg@@ ovina , and ko@@ so@@ vo 20 years on from the fall of the ber@@ lin wall and a decade after the end of the ko@@ so@@ vo war .
the findings seem to indicate that the next five years will be a ma@@ ke-@@ or-@@ break period for the region ’ s future development .
while the overwhelming majority of citizens are convinced that further armed conflict in the region is unlikely , the public ’ s mood – with the exception of ko@@ so@@ v@@ ars and alb@@ ani@@ ans – is p@@ essimis@@ tic .
the future promises peace without development .
trust in political el@@ ites and in national and europ@@ ean institutions has been steadily declining .
the majority of citizens have experienced a decline in living standards in the last year , and there remains a perception that people have more opportunities outside their own countries .
p@@ essimis@@ m about employment is alarm@@ ingly high among young people , while corruption and government mis@@ management are regarded as being widespread .
all those who have made it their job to praise the stability in the region should look at these figures .
indeed , it is striking that the majority of citizens of bo@@ s@@ nia and herz@@ eg@@ ovina believe that their leaders are not interested in their country joining the eu .
an absolute majority of citizens in each of the surve@@ yed countries are convinced that their country is heading in the wrong direction .
less than one in 10 cro@@ ats ( whose country could be joining the eu in the near future ) believes that their country is heading in the right direction .
there are now two options for the region : one is a “ shock integration ” program that takes all of the western bal@@ kan states into the eu ; the other is a journey into the unknown .
the hope that these countries can mu@@ ddle through on their own is a dangerous illu@@ sion .
stability alone can no longer be the eu ’ s only objective in the region .
the eu ’ s continuing presence as a colonial power in places like bo@@ s@@ nia and herz@@ eg@@ ovina and ko@@ so@@ vo could cause even more problems in the future , especially if benefits are not forthcoming .
in particular , a delay in ser@@ bia ’ s integration into the eu could bring ti@@ to-@@ inspired fan@@ ta@@ sies to the heart of the country ’ s foreign and security policy .
thus , dem@@ or@@ alization of bal@@ kan society creates a dynamic of its own when the best and the bri@@ gh@@ test see their future outside of their own countries and where “ stability ” is just another name for political and economic stag@@ nation .
if europ@@ ean leaders do plan to meet in 2014 in sar@@ aje@@ vo , they should act now .
the ratification of the l@@ is@@ bon treaty allows for an element of vision@@ ary realis@@ m in europ@@ ean politics , as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the eu .
today , unlike a year ago , we know how many states are in the bal@@ kan@@ s , and the bal@@ kan monitor results show that all of them want to join the union .
what the eu has learned from the results of the last parliamentary elections in bul@@ g@@ aria is that , contrary to conventional wisdom , the leverage of br@@ ussel@@ s over new member states increases rather than dimin@@ ishes after they join .
the eu ’ s decision to liber@@ alize its visa regime for ser@@ bia , mon@@ tene@@ gro , and mac@@ ed@@ onia – and the fact that ge@@ or@@ ge pap@@ and@@ re@@ ou , the major architect of the eu ’ s bal@@ kan integration strategy , is back in power in gre@@ ece – is another source of optim@@ ism .
but it is now or never for the bal@@ kan@@ s .
visa liberalization can be a strategic step in the direction of “ shock integration , ” but if it is not followed by bold political action from the eu , it could merely become a re-@@ packaging of the status quo .
in short , the moment has arrived for shaping events instead of simply marking anni@@ vers@@ aries .
closing europ@@ e ’ s strategy gap
ma@@ dri@@ d – the ongoing crisis in ukra@@ ine has been a hot topic of analysis for almost a year .
but one question has largely escap@@ ed thorough examination : what rus@@ sia ’ s anne@@ x@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a and invasion of eastern ukra@@ ine indicates about the europ@@ ean union ’ s foreign policy .
during the early stages of the crisis , ger@@ many , which had bet heavily on rus@@ sia ’ s moderni@@ zation , was a@@ verse to taking any consequ@@ ential action .
but , as the crisis deep@@ ened , german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a merk@@ el worked to persuade her europ@@ ean counterparts to implement a broad and bit@@ ing sanctions regime .
this certainly was a step in the right direction , but it did nothing to address the foreign@@ -@@ policy fail@@ ings that helped spar@@ k the ukra@@ inian crisis and continue to undermine europ@@ e ’ s response – namely , the eu ’ s mis@@ guided neighbor@@ hood policy ( en@@ p ) and its mu@@ dd@@ led approach to energy .
on both of these fron@@ ts , the eu ’ s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that europ@@ e is repeatedly being out@@ man@@ eu@@ ver@@ ed by rus@@ sian president v@@ ladimir pu@@ tin .
it increasingly appears that ukra@@ ine is becoming locked in a “ frozen conflict ” – rus@@ sia ’ s foreign@@ -@@ policy speci@@ alty .
indeed , the situation in ukra@@ ine represents a tac@@ tical victory for rus@@ sia , with the fragile but en@@ during ceas@@ e@@ fire – and accompanying legislation that grants don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk considerable political autonomy – allowing rus@@ sia to entr@@ en@@ ch the conflict near the eu ’ s border .
moreover , the delayed implementation of key elements of the eu ’ s association agreement with ukra@@ ine is clear evidence that , at the moment , rus@@ sia dict@@ ates the terms of eu@@ -@@ ukra@@ inian engagement .
in europ@@ e , the kre@@ m@@ lin has been able to pursue a successful di@@ vide@@ -@@ and-@@ rule strategy , particularly in view of hung@@ ary ’ s decision to suspend gas flows to ukra@@ ine .
prime minister vi@@ ktor or@@ b@@ án ’ s government , whose behavior in recent years has been at od@@ ds with the eu ’ s criteria for democracy , now openly approves of author@@ itarian regimes – and pu@@ tin ’ s , in particular – with serious potential consequences for europ@@ ean unity .
nonetheless , the timing of the current ceas@@ e@@ fire , which coinci@@ des with the installation of a new eu commission , is advan@@ tage@@ ous , as is pu@@ tin ’ s short@@ si@@ ghted emphasis on tac@@ tical vic@@ tories .
with a long-term strategic vision , the eu could overwhel@@ m and ultimately undermine pu@@ tin ’ s short-term successes .
such a vision must include a re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alization of the en@@ p .
the program ’ s mission – to help guide the political , social , and economic transi@@ tions of neighbor@@ ing states – is not inher@@ ently problematic ; the problem lies in the way that the mission has been interpreted and pursued .
for star@@ ters , the en@@ p assumes that all of the eu ’ s neigh@@ b@@ ors , both in the south and in the east , ultimately want to realize europ@@ ean values and structures in their own countries .
in other words , the en@@ p does not account for the develop@@ mental , cultural , and aspir@@ ational differences among the eu ’ s partner countries .
the en@@ p suff@@ ers operation@@ ally from its exc@@ essively technical approach and lack of strategic vision .
for example , before the ukra@@ ine crisis , the europ@@ ean commission was so focused on negotiating the technical features of the association agreement that it did not consider adequately the potential fall@@ out of the process – such as , say , a response from rus@@ sia .
to be sure , the eu recognized its need for a coherent strategy , and attempted to resolve it by establishing the europ@@ ean external action service and the position of high representative for foreign affairs .
but the ee@@ as ended up in a tur@@ f war with the europ@@ ean commission , and out@@ going high representative ca@@ therine ash@@ ton did little to ease the tension , owing to her un@@ willingness to involve herself in in@@ tra-@@ eu dis@@ agreements .
it is telling that ash@@ ton has made progress exclusively in areas defined by ample consensus , such as the negotiations on ir@@ an ’ s nuclear program and the pact between ko@@ so@@ vo and ser@@ bia .
further ero@@ ding europ@@ e ’ s effectiveness is its frag@@ mented approach to securing energy supplies .
with every country largely controlling its own energy policy , europ@@ e ’ s energy market has become in@@ efficient and exc@@ essively dependent on rus@@ sian supplies .
to the extent that there has been an eu@@ -@@ wide energy strategy , it has related to renew@@ ables , rather than the inter@@ section of geo@@ politics and energy security .
but there is reason for hope .
the new commission , which its president , j@@ ean c@@ lau@@ de jun@@ cker , has re@@ structured significantly , could provide europ@@ e with the strategic leadership it so badly needs .
in fact , jun@@ cker has already expressed a desire to integrate incoming high representative feder@@ ica mo@@ gher@@ ini into the commission ’ s policy program .
the new structure – which tasks mo@@ gher@@ ini with guiding and coordinating the work of multiple commission@@ ers , including those responsible for trade , the en@@ p , and climate and energy – should strengthen the coherence and direction of eu policies , particularly after mo@@ gher@@ ini comple@@ tes her europ@@ ean coun@@ c@@ il-@@ mand@@ ated assessment of the global strategic landscape .
but a re@@ structured commission is not enough to ensure a re@@ set of europ@@ e ’ s foreign@@ -@@ policy strategy .
for that to happen , mo@@ gher@@ ini must asser@@ t herself as a leader , backed by jun@@ cker and the new europ@@ ean council president , don@@ ald t@@ us@@ k .
and , most important , all eu member states must rec@@ omm@@ it themselves to cooperation .
the ukra@@ inian people have demonstrated the power of europ@@ e ’ s values .
indeed , europ@@ e has a large set of tools at its disposal ; it just needs to figure out how to use them .
if it can , it will be better able to respond not only to the rus@@ sian challenge , but also to many of the other challenges that character@@ ize today ’ s rapidly shi@@ fting global environment .
a europ@@ e for all
long@@ time members of the europ@@ ean union now seem to doubt the union ’ s future , but we in ukra@@ ine look at the europ@@ ean union with hope and ad@@ mir@@ ation .
to join in the eu ’ s progress is the basic object of our foreign policy , for ukra@@ ine has discovered that nation@@ hood is not an end , but a beginning .
indeed , europ@@ ean unity is indi@@ visible : when one nation is o@@ stra@@ ci@@ zed , all are not free .
we europ@@ e@@ ans are caught in an in@@ es@@ capable net , tied in a single gar@@ ment of dest@@ iny .
every aspect of our shared culture , if not the last century of shared suffering , confirms that for us .
whatever affects one europ@@ ean directly , affects all indirectly .
never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two europ@@ es , of ha@@ ves and ha@@ ve-@@ no@@ ts , of in@@ si@@ ders and out@@ si@@ ders .
anyone who lives within the europ@@ ean continent cannot – indeed , must not – be considered a stran@@ ger to its union .
today ’ s great pa@@ x europa and today ’ s pan@@ -@@ europ@@ ean prosperity depend on this .
of course , some people mut@@ ter that ukra@@ ine is not europ@@ e .
let them come to k@@ y@@ i@@ v and speak to the people , young and old , factory worker , far@@ mer ’ s wife , the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms .
are they not united with those who stood alongside general de gau@@ lle in the f@@ ren@@ ch resistance ?
are they not one with those who died fighting for the span@@ ish re@@ public in the 1930 ’ s , who liber@@ ated bu@@ dap@@ est in 1956 and ended fasc@@ ism in sp@@ ain and portu@@ gal in the 1970 ’ s ?
are they not anim@@ ated by the same spirit as pol@@ and ’ s solidarity and the peaceful m@@ asses that created pra@@ gue ’ s vel@@ v@@ et revolution in 1989 ?
that is the true europ@@ ean spirit , and no doubts can cr@@ ush it .
to those who say that ukra@@ ine is too back@@ ward for eu membership , i say : let them , too , come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer .
let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are read@@ ying themselves for europ@@ e by learning f@@ ren@@ ch and german and engl@@ ish@@ .@@ those who doubt ukra@@ ine ’ s europ@@ ean vocation should understand that europ@@ e is not a matter of hardware and super@@ high@@ ways ; it is the un@@ qu@@ en@@ ch@@ able desire for freedom , prosperity , and solidarity .
i believe that our future is as promising as europ@@ e ’ s past is proud , and that our dest@@ iny lies not as a forgotten bor@@ der@@ land on a troub@@ led region , but as a maker and sha@@ per of europ@@ e ’ s peace and europ@@ e ’ s unity .
self-@@ determination no longer means isolation , because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status .
new nations can build with their former occu@@ pi@@ ers the same kind of fruit@@ ful relationship that fran@@ ce established with ger@@ many – a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests .
that is the type of relationship that my government seeks with rus@@ sia , and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of europ@@ e ’ s peace .
of course , it is pre@@ mature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of eu membership .
we know that our part in that great edi@@ fi@@ ce will not be built overnight .
we know that the great works of europ@@ ean unification lay not in documents and declarations , but in innovative action designed to better the lives and ins@@ ure the security of all europ@@ e@@ ans .
building a ukra@@ ine worthy of eu membership will not be easy , cheap , or fast .
but , like the union itself , it will be built and it will be done .
we know the challenge is great , but the prize is worth the struggle , and europ@@ e should know that this is our goal .
part of the work of rene@@ wing ukra@@ ine is a creative battle to put an end to a night@@ mar@@ ish century during which fasc@@ ism and commun@@ ism – ide@@ ologies born in the heart of europ@@ e – batt@@ led for master@@ y .
only a few months ago , in cities throughout ukra@@ ine , our children and our parents confronted armed troops , s@@ nar@@ ling dogs , and even death .
only a few years ago , a young journalist , ge@@ org@@ i g@@ ong@@ ad@@ ze , seeking to inform the public about our old regime ’ s corruption , was brut@@ alized and be@@ headed by that regime ’ s thu@@ gs .
but our orange revolution last winter shows that ukra@@ ine ’ s people prev@@ ailed .
so , despite today ’ s doubts and difficulties , i retain an abi@@ ding faith in europ@@ e .
i refuse to accept des@@ pair as the final response to the ambigu@@ ities and hor@@ rors of ukra@@ ine ’ s history .
i refuse to accept the view that ukra@@ ine is so tra@@ gi@@ cally bound to the star@@ less mid@@ night of commun@@ ism ’ s legacy that we can never see the bright day@@ break of peace and true europ@@ ean unity .
when the eu ’ s citizens pon@@ der ukra@@ ine ’ s place in europ@@ e , they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see .
they should look beyond the ra@@ v@@ aged wa@@ stel@@ ands that commun@@ ism inf@@ lic@@ ted , beyond the poverty , and beyond the social divisions through which our dis@@ car@@ ded ex-@@ leaders sought to pro@@ long their mis@@ rule .
instead , they should look closely at the face of our president , vi@@ ktor y@@ ush@@ chen@@ ko , ra@@ v@@ aged by po@@ ison during last year ’ s election campaign , and recall the words of the great f@@ ren@@ ch@@ man and@@ r@@ é mal@@ rau@@ x , for whom “ the most beautiful faces are those that have been wo@@ unded . ”
a europ@@ e of provin@@ ces , not states
as the europ@@ ean constitutional convention assem@@ bles to debate the fine points of the europ@@ ean union &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s future institutions , now is the moment to think the un@@ thin@@ k@@ able about where europ@@ e is heading .
or at least , to consider perhaps a quite different question : where would it be reasonable for the eu to move ?
commun@@ ism &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fall saw the appearance of several small states in europ@@ e .
est@@ onia , lat@@ via , and li@@ thu@@ ania re@@ emerged from so@@ vi@@ et occupation .
cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia split into two separate states .
y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via gave way to slo@@ ven@@ ia , cro@@ ati@@ a , bo@@ s@@ nia , ser@@ bia , mac@@ ed@@ onia ; it may perhaps shortly dis@@ gor@@ ge ko@@ so@@ vo and mon@@ tene@@ gro as well .
although the bal@@ tic re@@ public@@ s merely re@@ established their pre-@@ w@@ wi@@ i independence , and y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s break@@ up was a bloo@@ dy affair like so many other wars of independence , there is something t@@ ant@@ alizing new in all this as well .
in the inter@@ war years , the bal@@ tic states were often viewed as im@@ practical , artificial cre@@ ations of the great powers .
cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia and y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via came into existence because their constitu@@ ent parts were not seen as viable independent states .
why was this ?
because 80 years ago , when wil@@ son , cle@@ men@@ ce@@ au , and l@@ loy@@ d ge@@ or@@ ge re@@ drew the map of europ@@ e , small states were d@@ ys@@ functional in times of both war and peace .
to be viable , a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-@@ contained economic market .
none of this holds true today .
with the prospect of entry into the eu , national markets matter less .
both eu and nat@@ o membership make war among europ@@ ean member states un@@ thin@@ k@@ able , and an attack on even the smallest nat@@ o member would bring a response from all nat@@ o members .
lacking such external threats , the ties between , say , cz@@ ech@@ s and slo@@ v@@ aks ( to say nothing of ser@@ bs and cro@@ ats ! ) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government .
does this tell us something about the future of europ@@ e as a whole ?
the difference between cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia and ital@@ y or ger@@ many is mostly one of 50 years .
after all , wasn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t ital@@ y , until 18@@ 6@@ 0s , a collection of king@@ d@@ oms and princip@@ alities ?
wasn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t ger@@ many &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s unification a matter of `@@ `@@ blood and iron &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; ?
fran@@ ce and sp@@ ain are older , but is the marriage of bas@@ ques , cat@@ al@@ ans , and cor@@ si@@ cans with their national states that much happ@@ ier than the former cz@@ ech / slo@@ v@@ ak marriage ?
is there really that much reason why the sco@@ ts and wel@@ sh should be part of the same national state as the english ?
abstra@@ ct for a second from the idea of f@@ ren@@ ch or german or itali@@ an identity , patri@@ o@@ tism , the collective memories of war and car@@ n@@ age that ce@@ mented the consci@@ ousness of today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s linguistic communities and think of this : why do europ@@ e@@ ans need an intermediate level of government , between the common europ@@ ean framework and their local institutions ?
why do pi@@ em@@ ont@@ ese , b@@ av@@ ari@@ ans , or sco@@ ts need intermediate national bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cies to run their tax policies , welfare programs , securities laws , and the largely us@@ eless , dup@@ lic@@ ative ar@@ mi@@ es ?
w@@ ouldn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t life be easier if a common market , currency , foreign policy , army , and a few other things were run on a europ@@ e-@@ wide basis , with the rest left to more meaningful local units ?
it is fashi@@ onable to mo@@ ck the bureaucratic min@@ uti@@ a of europ@@ ean regulation .
but europ@@ ean regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decre@@ es , billions wa@@ sted in political pat@@ ron@@ age , and the colo@@ ss@@ al state machines that eat up 30-@@ 40 % of the economic product of europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s nation states .
could any common europ@@ ean state do worse ?
indeed , the creation of a europ@@ ean federal government and the elimination of national intermedi@@ aries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy ( and society as a whole ) in europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s entire history .
look at ameri@@ ca in 17@@ 87 : creation of the federal government swe@@ pt away the bal@@ kan@@ ized system of pre-@@ revolutionary colon@@ ies , us@@ her@@ ing in an era of entrepreneur@@ ial expansion across the entire ameri@@ can continent .
the simple fact is that europ@@ e as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now domin@@ ate national states .
it is only as an additional level of government that the eu appears on@@ erous and bureaucratic .
if it were to dis@@ place national governments , its burden would be wei@@ ght@@ less in comparison to what exists today .
nations also put europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s constitutional balance out of kil@@ ter .
ger@@ many and ital@@ y are simply too big , as compared to portu@@ gal or bel@@ gi@@ um ( itself a rather question@@ able am@@ al@@ g@@ am of the fle@@ m@@ ish and the wal@@ lo@@ ons ) , and this creates the types of imbalances remin@@ is@@ cent of the heavy foot of pr@@ us@@ sia in the old bis@@ mar@@ ck@@ ian emp@@ ire .
could a federal europ@@ e replace today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s national identi@@ ties ?
could the f@@ ren@@ ch and the bri@@ tish feel as spir@@ it@@ ually at home in `@@ `@@ europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; as they feel in their national states ?
no , but must they ?
when europ@@ e@@ ans think of future institutions , the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common europ@@ ean identity .
but what if common europ@@ ean institutions are not viewed through the pr@@ ism of national institutions ?
what if the evolution of europ@@ ean consci@@ ousness proce@@ eds not by an up@@ ward transfer of atta@@ chment to supran@@ ational institutions , but by a de@@ volution of loy@@ alties , and a revi@@ val of smaller , more meaningful , communities ?
of course , the dem@@ ise of national states is not im@@ min@@ ent , but not because they are so deeply roo@@ ted in the consci@@ ousness of their citizens .
indeed , national identi@@ ties are mostly im@@ pover@@ ishing abstra@@ c@@ tions , c@@ lich@@ és , like race , class , and other ideological cre@@ ations .
think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united europ@@ e if national states did not squ@@ at in the middle .
but europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they are centers of power .
after all , for@@ ty c@@ ents out of every euro of g@@ d@@ p is a lot to fight about .
if , however , europ@@ e@@ ans gain a sense of where they should be going , perhaps in time the national identi@@ ties for@@ ged in the last couple of hundred years ( for they are not much older than that ) will become like the app@@ endi@@ x - a part of the human body responsible for little else but an occa@@ sional infl@@ amm@@ ation .
a europ@@ e of women ?
par@@ is – are women in europ@@ e on the ver@@ ge of becoming an engine for political change ?
in econom@@ ic-@@ development cir@@ cles , experience and common sense suggest that progress , accountability , and hard work start with and depend on women .
micro-@@ credits , for example , are much more efficient when women receive and re@@ pay them .
perhaps because they bear children and must find the means to feed them , women are now perceived as the best and most determined “ agents of change . ”
that seems to be as true now of europ@@ ean politics as it has been of economics in parts of afri@@ ca and a@@ sia .
the results of ital@@ y ’ s recent municipal elections could be a signal of an in@@ cip@@ i@@ ent electoral dynamic : it was women who voted sil@@ vio ber@@ lus@@ coni ’ s party out of power in mil@@ an , a city that he has long controlled ( and the original seat of his power ) .
no direct link exists between that result and the dramatic dom@@ ini@@ que str@@ aus@@ s-@@ k@@ ahn sc@@ andal in new y@@ or@@ k , but in the immediate after@@ math of ds@@ k ’ s arrest , itali@@ an women and young voters decisi@@ vely mobili@@ zed to defeat ber@@ lus@@ coni ’ s party ( led in mil@@ an , ir@@ on@@ ically , by a woman ) .
these voters could no longer stand the combination of mach@@ ismo and vul@@ gar@@ ity that had once served so well the man itali@@ an hum@@ or@@ ists now call “ ber@@ l@@ us-@@ k@@ ahn . ”
when ber@@ lus@@ coni first came to power 17 years ago , he had the support of a majority of women .
they were not dis@@ cour@@ aged by his ambi@@ valent perception of them ( by turns celeb@@ rating their traditional dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ity and gl@@ ori@@ fying their sexual objec@@ ti@@ fication ) .
but itali@@ an society has changed : most women are now working , and they are no longer willing to accept bel@@ us@@ coni ’ s an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic and ou@@ trage@@ ous ch@@ au@@ vin@@ ism .
itali@@ an men may p@@ ity the aging , isolated leader , who looks increasingly like his wa@@ x eff@@ ig@@ y at ma@@ dam@@ e t@@ uss@@ au@@ d ’ s .
but itali@@ an women ( indeed , women everywhere , it seems ) feel only anger and hum@@ ili@@ ation over a man so ob@@ s@@ essed with himself , his various criminal trials , and his vul@@ gar pleas@@ ures that he appears to them to have no purpose left except to remain in power as long as possible .
women , of course , are not alone in their opposition to ber@@ lus@@ coni , but they made the difference in mil@@ an .
they are the inc@@ ar@@ nation of modern@@ ity , anim@@ ated by a year@@ ning for simple dignity and respect .
they are not alone in the van@@ guard of a new europ@@ e of women .
as ic@@ eland spir@@ aled into bankrupt@@ cy , owing the ir@@ responsible behavior of its mostly male political and financial el@@ ites , the people of ic@@ eland decided that only a strong and responsible woman could red@@ ress the country ’ s problems .
so they elected one as president .
the depth and grav@@ ity of the current economic and social crisis in countries like gre@@ ece , portu@@ gal , and sp@@ ain present women with a new opportunity .
confronted with what many of them perc@@ eive as the equivalent of an “ economic war , ” women are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining their families ’ financial security .
and the more widespread this becomes , the more women will seek a political role that reflects their economic cl@@ out .
of course , women ’ s changing status may not translate immediately into growing political influence .
and the rest of europ@@ e might never follow the example of sc@@ andin@@ a@@ via , where gender equality has advanced much further than anywhere else .
but such a dynamic does now seem to be in motion .
simil@@ arly , regardless of the outcome of ds@@ k ’ s trial in new y@@ or@@ k , the case might represent a turning point in the treatment of women in europ@@ e .
public and private displays of at@@ av@@ istic mach@@ ismo , one hopes , will no longer be considered acceptable .
in the ar@@ ab world , too , from tun@@ is to c@@ airo , young women have played an important role in the revolutionary process .
their appe@@ ti@@ te for change – understandable , given the treatment of women in traditional mus@@ li@@ m societies – appears to be one of the main causes underlying the force of the revolutionary impul@@ se in tun@@ isi@@ a and eg@@ yp@@ t .
none of this is to argue that “ women ” are a universal force for positive change in europ@@ e and around the world .
consider , for example , marine le pen , the new head of fran@@ ce ’ s national front , el@@ ena ce@@ auc@@ esc@@ u , the sor@@ did wife of the former roman@@ ian dict@@ ator , or , more recently , tun@@ isi@@ an ex-@@ president zine el ab@@ id@@ ine ben ali ’ s wife , lei@@ la tra@@ bel@@ si , who fl@@ ed to du@@ bai with 1.5 tons of gold pl@@ under@@ ed from the central bank .
the point , simply , is that with so many people in so many countries demanding far-reaching change , the politics of gender is very much in play – in europ@@ e and beyond .
the main question is whether the growing number of women in politics will deliver the different perspectives and modes of leadership that many voters ( or prote@@ sters ) now seem to cra@@ ve .
a failed global recovery
new haven – the global economy is in the midst of its second growth sc@@ are in less than two years .
get used to it .
in a post-@@ crisis world , these are the foot@@ prints of a failed recovery .
the reason is simple .
the typical business cycle has a natural c@@ us@@ hi@@ oning mechanism that wards off un@@ expected blo@@ ws .
the deeper the down@@ turn , the more powerful the sn@@ ap@@ back , and the greater the cum@@ ul@@ ative forces of self-@@ su@@ sta@@ ining revi@@ val .
vig@@ orous v@@ -@@ shaped re@@ bo@@ unds have a built-in re@@ sili@@ ence that allows them to shr@@ u@@ g off sho@@ cks relatively easily .
but a post-@@ crisis recovery is a very different animal .
as car@@ men rein@@ hart and kenn@@ eth ro@@ go@@ ff have shown in their book this time is different , over the long swe@@ ep of history , post-@@ crisis recover@@ ies in output and employment tend to be deci@@ de@@ dly sub@@ par .
such weak recover@@ ies , by definition , lack the c@@ us@@ hion of v@@ -@@ shaped re@@ bo@@ unds .
consequently , external sho@@ cks quickly ex@@ pose their vulnerability .
if the sho@@ cks are sharp enough – and if they hit a weak@@ ened global economy that is appro@@ aching its “ st@@ all speed ” of around 3 % annual growth – the rela@@ p@@ se could turn into the d@@ read@@ ed double-@@ di@@ p recession .
that is the risk today .
there can be no mis@@ taking the deci@@ de@@ dly sub@@ par character of the current global recovery .
super@@ fici@@ ally , the numbers look strong : world g@@ d@@ p re@@ bo@@ unded by 5.@@ 1 % in 2010 , and is expected to rise another 4.@@ 3 % in 2011 , according to the international monetary fund .
but because these gains follow the massive contra@@ ction that occurred during the great recession of 2008-@@ 2009 , they are a far c@@ ry from the tra@@ jec@@ tory of a classic v@@ -@@ shaped recovery .
indeed , if the im@@ f ’ s latest forecast proves correct , global g@@ d@@ p at the end of 2012 will still be about 2.2 percentage points below the level that would have been reached had the world remained on its lon@@ ger-@@ term 3.@@ 7 % ann@@ u@@ al-@@ growth path .
even if the global economy holds at a 4.@@ 3 % cru@@ ise speed – a big “ if , ” in my view – it will remain below its tr@@ end-@@ line potential for over eight years in a row , through 2015 .
this pro@@ trac@@ ted “ global output gap ” under@@ sco@@ res the absence of a c@@ us@@ hion in today ’ s world economy , as well as its hei@@ gh@@ tened sensitivity to sho@@ cks .
and there have certainly been numerous such blo@@ ws in recent months – from europ@@ e ’ s sovereign@@ -@@ debt crisis and jap@@ an ’ s natural disasters to sharp@@ ly higher oil prices and another set@@ back in the us housing recovery .
while none of these sho@@ cks appears to have been severe enough to have der@@ ailed the current global recovery , the combined effect is wor@@ ris@@ ome , especially in a still@@ -@@ weak@@ ened post-@@ crisis world .
most pun@@ di@@ ts dis@@ miss the possibility of a double-@@ di@@ p recession .
lab@@ eling the current slow@@ down a temporary “ soft patch , ” they pin their optim@@ ism on the inevitable re@@ bound that follows any shock .
for example , a boost is expected from jap@@ an ’ s reconstruction and sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ chain resu@@ mption .
another assist may come from ameri@@ ca ’ s recent move to tap its strategic pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um reserves in an effort to push oil prices lower .
but in the after@@ math of the worst crisis and recession of modern times – when sho@@ cks can push an already weak@@ ened global economy to its ti@@ pping point a lot faster than would be the case under a stronger growth scenario – the escape vel@@ o@@ city of self-@@ su@@ sta@@ ining recovery is much harder to achieve .
the soft patch may be closer to a qu@@ ag@@ mire .
this conclusion should not be lost on high-@@ flying emerg@@ ing-@@ market economies , especially in a@@ sia – currently the world ’ s fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing region and the leader of what many now call a two-@@ speed world .
yet with exports still close to a record 45 % of pan@@ -@@ regional g@@ d@@ p , a@@ sia can hardly afford to take external sho@@ cks ligh@@ tly – especially if they hit an already weak@@ ened bas@@ el@@ ine growth tra@@ jec@@ tory in the post-@@ crisis developed world .
the recent slow@@ down in chin@@ ese industrial activity under@@ sco@@ res this very risk .
policymakers are ill prepared to cope with a steady stream of growth sc@@ ares .
they continue to favor strategies that are better suited to combating crisis than to promoting post-@@ crisis healing .
that is certainly true of the united states .
while the us federal reserve board ’ s first round of quantitative eas@@ ing was effective in ending a w@@ ren@@ ching crisis , the second round has done little to sustain meaningful recovery in the labor market and the real economy .
ameri@@ ca ’ s z@@ om@@ bie consumers need to repair their damaged balance sheets , and us workers need to align new skills with new jobs .
europ@@ ean authorities are caught up in a similar min@@ d@@ set .
mis@@ taking a solvency problem for a liquidity short@@ fall , europ@@ e has become ho@@ oked on the dri@@ p feed of ba@@ il@@ outs .
however , this works only if countries like gre@@ ece grow their way out of a debt tra@@ p or ab@@ ro@@ gate their deeply entr@@ en@@ ched social contracts .
the od@@ ds on either are exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly poor .
the li@@ ke@@ lihood of recurr@@ ing growth sc@@ ares for the next several years implies little hope for new and creative approaches to post-@@ crisis monetary and fiscal policies .
driven by short-term electoral horiz@@ ons , policymakers repeatedly seek a quick fix – another ba@@ il@@ out or one more liquidity injection .
yet , in the after@@ math of a bal@@ ance-@@ sheet recession in the us , and in the midst of a debt tra@@ p in europ@@ e , that approach is do@@ om@@ ed to failure .
liquidity in@@ jec@@ tions and ba@@ il@@ outs serve only one purpose – to buy time .
yet time is not the answer for economies desper@@ ately in need of the structural repa@@ irs of fiscal consolidation , priv@@ ate-@@ sector dele@@ ver@@ aging , lab@@ or-@@ market reforms , or improved competitiveness .
nor does time c@@ us@@ hion an@@ em@@ ic post-@@ crisis recover@@ ies from the inevitable next shock .
it ’ s hard to know when the next shock will hit , or what form it will take ; otherwise , it w@@ ouldn ’ t be a shock .
but , as night follows day , such a dis@@ ruption is inevitable .
with policymakers reluc@@ tant to focus on the imper@@ atives of structural healing , the result will be yet another growth sc@@ are – or worse .
a failed recovery under@@ sco@@ res the risks of an increasingly tre@@ ach@@ erous end@@ game in today ’ s post-@@ crisis world .
a fair deal for tur@@ key
tur@@ key has been given what looks like an ul@@ tim@@ atum from the eu commission : open your ports for ships from c@@ yp@@ rus within a month , or you may risk a halt to the eu accession talks now underway .
at the same time , the commission ’ s latest report on tur@@ key ’ s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have s@@ lowed down , further calling into question the country ’ s future eu membership .
the commission ’ s progress report will be dealt with by the europ@@ ean council next month .
at that meeting , europ@@ ean leaders should ask themselves the following questions : has the eu given tur@@ key a fair deal in the case of c@@ yp@@ rus ?
has the eu ’ s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in tur@@ key ?
what are the eu ’ s long-term interests vis-à-vis tur@@ key ?
if the answers to the first two questions are “ no ” – as i believe they are – the third question becomes vit@@ ally important .
true , tur@@ key has closed its ports to ships from ( gre@@ ek ) c@@ yp@@ rus , and this is a violation of agreements .
but it is also true that the northern tur@@ k@@ ish part of c@@ yp@@ rus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from eu@@ -@@ membership .
this is because c@@ yp@@ rus remains a divided island .
it was assumed that c@@ yp@@ rus should be united when the country joined the eu in 2004 .
a united nations plan for unification was accepted by the tur@@ k@@ ish part .
but the gre@@ ek cy@@ pri@@ ots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the imp@@ licit deal with the eu to support it .
nevertheless , c@@ yp@@ rus became an eu member – but only the gre@@ ek part .
this was clearly a mistake , because it made the eu part of the conflict .
it gave gre@@ ek cy@@ pri@@ ot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the eu and tur@@ key .
so how can tur@@ key under these conditions maintain confidence in the eu ’ s fairness ?
political and legal reforms in tur@@ key in recent years have been remark@@ ably far-reaching , for they have clearly been sp@@ urred by tur@@ ks ’ wish to move closer to the eu .
but tur@@ k@@ ish public support for eu membership has fallen dramatically as tur@@ ks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal .
this has given new strength to those who want tur@@ key to develop in another direction , towards a more islam@@ ic society instead of a modern sec@@ ular state .
therefore , the recent lack of progress in tur@@ key ’ s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the eu ’ s behavior .
this leaves us with the third question : what kind of tur@@ key does the eu want ?
there should be no doubt about the answer : it is clearly in the eu ’ s interest to see tur@@ key ’ s democracy and economy continue to strengthen .
more than 40 years ago , it was promised that once tur@@ key lives up to the pre@@ conditions for membership , it will be welcome in the eu .
it is high time that europ@@ ean leaders take this promise seriously .
it is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the eu are against tur@@ k@@ ish membership .
but they are re@@ acting to the current situation .
when they are asked if they would like a reformed tur@@ key as a partner – a tur@@ key that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the cop@@ enhagen criteria ( democracy , rule of law , respect for human rights , and an effective market economy ) – many more are inc@@ lined to say yes .
europ@@ ean leaders must therefore take up two challenges .
first , they should say clearly to their own voters that the eu must live up to its promises to tur@@ key , and that this is in the larger interest of all europ@@ e@@ ans .
second , they should give tur@@ key a fair deal in the negotiations .
the first lit@@ mus test on europ@@ ean leadership concerns the practical problem of access to har@@ b@@ ors .
here the fin@@ ns , who chair the eu right now , have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict .
the fin@@ nis@@ h initiative should be given strong support from all europ@@ ean leaders .
if this means putting pressure on some actors within the eu ’ s own ranks , so be it .
a fair deal on climate change
the agreement on climate change reached at hei@@ li@@ gen@@ damm by the g@@ 8 leaders merely sets the stage for the real debate to come : how will we divide up the dimin@@ ishing capacity of the atmosphere to absor@@ b our greenhouse gases ?
the g@@ 8 leaders agreed to seek “ substantial ” cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and to give “ serious consideration ” to the goal of hal@@ ving such emissions by 2050 – an outcome ha@@ iled as a tri@@ ump@@ h by german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a merk@@ el and bri@@ tish prime minister ton@@ y bla@@ ir .
yet the agreement comm@@ its no one to any specific targets , least of all the united states , whose president , ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush , will no longer be in office in 2009 , when the tough decisions have to be made .
one could reasonably ask why anyone thinks such a v@@ ague agreement is any kind of advance at all .
at the united nations conference on environment and development in ri@@ o de jan@@ eiro in 1992 , 18@@ 9 countries , including the us , ch@@ ina , indi@@ a , and all the europ@@ ean nations , signed the un framework convention on climate change , thereby agreeing to stabili@@ ze greenhouse gases “ at a low enough level to prevent dangerous an@@ thro@@ po@@ genic interference with the climate system . ”
fifteen years later , no country has done that .
us per capita greenhouse gas emissions , already the highest of any major nation when b@@ ush took office , have continued to rise .
in mar@@ ch , a le@@ aked b@@ ush administration report showed that us emissions were expected to rise almost as fast over the next decade as they did during the previous decade .
now we have yet another agreement to do what these same nations said they would do 15 years ago .
that ’ s a tri@@ ump@@ h ?
if b@@ ush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails , that will be easy enough .
in justi@@ fying his refusal to sign the k@@ yo@@ to protocol , b@@ ush has always referred to the fact that it did not commit ch@@ ina and indi@@ a to mandatory emission limits .
now , in response to suggestions by b@@ ush and other g@@ 8 leaders that the larger developing nations must be part of the solution to climate change , ma ka@@ i , the head of ch@@ ina ’ s national development and reform commission , has said that ch@@ ina will not commit to any quanti@@ fied emissions reduction targets .
likewise , the spokes@@ man of indi@@ a ’ s foreign minister , nav@@ te@@ j sar@@ na , has said that his country would reject such mandatory restrictions .
are ch@@ ina and indi@@ a being un@@ reasonable ?
their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases emit@@ ted by the industri@@ alized nations over the past century .
that is true : most of those gases are still in the atmosphere , and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it now is .
ch@@ ina and indi@@ a claim the right to proceed with industri@@ alization and development as the developed nations did , un@@ ham@@ pered by limits on their greenhouse gas emissions .
ch@@ ina , indi@@ a , and other developing nations , have a point – or rather , three points .
first , if we apply the principle “ you broke it , you fix it , ” then the developed nations have to take responsibility for our “ broken ” atmosphere , which can no longer absor@@ b more greenhouse gases without the world ’ s climate changing .
second , even if we wi@@ pe the s@@ late clean and forget about who caused the problem , it remains true that the typical us resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical chin@@ ese , and as much as 18 times more than the average indi@@ an .
third , the ri@@ cher nations are better able than less well-@@ off nations to absor@@ b the costs of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations .
but it is also true that if ch@@ ina and indi@@ a continue to increase their output of greenhouse gases , they will eventually und@@ o all the good that would be achieved by deep emissions cuts in the industri@@ alized nations .
this year or next , ch@@ ina will over@@ take the us as the world ’ s biggest greenhouse gas em@@ itter – on a national , rather than a per capita basis , of course .
in 25 years , according to f@@ ati@@ h bi@@ rol , chief econom@@ ist at the international energy agency , ch@@ ina ’ s emissions could be double those of the us , europ@@ e , and jap@@ an combined .
but there is a solution that is both fair and practical :
the fairness of giving every person on earth an equal share of the atmosphere ’ s capacity to absor@@ b our greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to deny .
why should anyone have a greater entit@@ lement than others to use the earth ’ s atmosphere ?
but , in addition to being fair , this scheme also has practical benefits .
it would give developing nations a strong incentive to accept mandatory quotas , because if they can keep their per capita emissions low , they will have excess emissions rights to sell to the industri@@ alized nations .
the rich countries will benefit , too , because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of reducing emissions and buying up emissions rights from developing nations .
a f@@ are@@ well to ( gl@@ orious ) war
in recent days , ital@@ y ’ s government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country ’ s tro@@ op deployment in afgh@@ an@@ istan , while b@@ rit@@ ain and den@@ mark announced that they are to begin with@@ drawing their troops from i@@ ra@@ q .
whereas the b@@ ush administration is deplo@@ ying an additional 2@@ 1,000 ameri@@ can soldiers in i@@ ra@@ q , and is pushing for more al@@ lied troops in afgh@@ an@@ istan , ameri@@ ca ’ s allies are re@@ jecting its middle east policy .
they are increasingly convinced that “ victory ” will be el@@ u@@ sive in any asymmet@@ ric conflict between states , however powerful , and religi@@ ously driven armed insur@@ gen@@ ts .
don@@ ald ru@@ ms@@ feld ’ s dog@@ ma of military “ transformation ” – the technological upgrading of an army ’ s capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops – failed re@@ sound@@ ingly in i@@ ra@@ q .
nor could isra@@ el , with its overwhelming technological advantage , defeat he@@ z@@ bollah in le@@ ban@@ on .
more ro@@ ckets and missi@@ les fell on northern isra@@ el in 33 days than hit b@@ rit@@ ain during all of world war ii .
so the isra@@ eli@@ s now must reck@@ on with an entirely new phenomenon : an asymmet@@ ric entity , he@@ z@@ bollah , with nation@@ -@@ state fire@@ power .
so the fi@@ erce debate over whether to increase the size of ameri@@ can ground forces in i@@ ra@@ q is beside the point .
neither the so@@ vi@@ et experience in afgh@@ an@@ istan in the 1980 ’ s nor nat@@ o ’ s today v@@ indicates the claim that tro@@ op numbers are what matter most on the modern batt@@ le@@ field .
when ge@@ o-@@ strategic military front lines are non-@@ exist@@ ent , as in ko@@ so@@ vo , afgh@@ an@@ istan , and i@@ ra@@ q , mass no longer equ@@ als victory .
the great military thin@@ ker car@@ l von c@@ lau@@ se@@ witz ’ s notion of “ decisive batt@@ les ” as the “ center of grav@@ ity ” of war is simply ir@@ relevant to conflicts that have no visible “ center of grav@@ ity . ”
indeed , while wars from the time of han@@ ni@@ bal ’ s defeat of the roman@@ s in 2@@ 16 b@@ .@@ c. to the g@@ ulf war of 1991 had this center of grav@@ ity , with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its kne@@ es , such industrial inter-@@ state wars have now become an historical an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism .
most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate , and they increasingly abi@@ de by international norms of behavior in times of war .
in fact , the obligation of states to abi@@ de by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to bar@@ b@@ ari@@ ze war@@ fare is what makes asymmet@@ ric wars especially in@@ solu@@ ble .
moreover , in an era of global media and international war crimes courts , the criteria for states ’ use of military force have become more complex than ever .
inter-@@ state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found , such as isra@@ el ’ s border with sy@@ ria , indi@@ a ’ s border with pak@@ istan , and the border divi@@ ding the two kore@@ as .
in such cases , war , as the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans showed in 1973 , might still serve as an a@@ venue to resolving a conflict .
the sy@@ ri@@ ans might be temp@@ ted to launch an offensive against isra@@ el with the objective of breaking the dead@@ lock over the future of the gol@@ an hei@@ ghts .
however , in the case of k@@ ash@@ mir , the asymmet@@ ric conflict currently fought by pro@@ x@@ ies and terrorist groups might not de@@ generate into all-@@ out war precisely because indi@@ a and pak@@ istan have mutual nuclear deter@@ ren@@ c@@ e.@@ indeed , such asymmet@@ ric conflicts through pro@@ x@@ ies have become the new conventional way that states avoid the price of a general war .
this changing nature of the batt@@ le@@ field essentially means that war as a conclu@@ sive event in an international conflict has become ob@@ sole@@ te .
the fac@@ ile c@@ lau@@ se@@ wit@@ zi@@ an wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing .
“ victory ” cannot bring peace , simply because there will always be a war after the war .
thus , for example , the conventional war in ko@@ so@@ vo la@@ sted for two months , only to us@@ her in a six-@@ year asymmet@@ ric conflict .
likewise , ameri@@ ca ’ s three-@@ week “ shock and a@@ we ” campaign in i@@ ra@@ q in 2003 ended in “ victory , ” but opened the g@@ ates of hell for occu@@ pi@@ ers and ordinary i@@ ra@@ q@@ is alike .
and six months after the merc@@ il@@ ess po@@ unding of southern le@@ ban@@ on , he@@ z@@ bollah is as strong as it was before .
nor does the return of the tali@@ ban in afgh@@ an@@ istan six years after their over@@ throw now seen too far-@@ fet@@ ched .
it is during the war after the war that the occup@@ ier ’ s inf@@ eri@@ ority is revealed , with constant rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements increasing the number of targets for the insur@@ gen@@ ts far more quickly than the occup@@ ier can adapt to the changing batt@@ le@@ field .
the insur@@ gen@@ ts in i@@ ra@@ q , as the bri@@ tish admit , were able in just three years to cope with their enemies ’ technological sup@@ eri@@ ority in a way that the ira in northern i@@ reland was unable to do in 30 years .
the i@@ ra@@ q war and isra@@ el ’ s wars with ham@@ as and he@@ z@@ bollah show the limits of what military power can achieve , as well as v@@ indicate diplomacy and conflict resolution .
when it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts , for@@ ging international and regional al@@ liances around a legitimate objective is more important than she@@ er military capacity .
that said , it would be danger@@ ously na@@ ï@@ ve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intim@@ i@@ date are unnecessary .
but the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today ’ s asymmet@@ ric conflicts , victory is no longer achieved on the batt@@ le@@ field .
only bet@@ ter-@@ informed foreign policies that can address the genuine an@@ x@@ ieties of civi@@ liz@@ ations in crisis will yield more sustainable results .
mo@@ sco@@ w – twenty-@@ five years ago this month , i sat across from ron@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an in re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k , ic@@ eland to negotiate a deal that would have reduced , and could have ultimately eliminated by 2000 , the f@@ ear@@ some ar@@ sen@@ als of nuclear weapons held by the united states and the so@@ vi@@ et union .
for all our differences , re@@ ag@@ an and i shared the strong conviction that civili@@ zed countries should not make such bar@@ b@@ ari@@ c weapons the lin@@ ch@@ pin of their security .
even though we failed to achieve our highest aspirations in re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k , the summit was nonetheless , in the words of my former counter@@ part , “ a major turning point in the quest for a safer and secure world . ”
the next few years may well determine if our shared dream of ri@@ dding the world of nuclear weapons will ever be realized .
critics present nuclear dis@@ armament as un@@ realistic at best , and a ris@@ ky ut@@ op@@ ian dream at worst .
they point to the cold war ’ s “ long peace ” as proof that nuclear deter@@ r@@ ence is the only means of sta@@ ving off a major war .
as someone who has comm@@ anded these weapons , i strongly disagree .
nuclear deter@@ r@@ ence has always been a hard and b@@ rit@@ tle guar@@ ant@@ or of peace .
by failing to propose a comp@@ elling plan for nuclear dis@@ armament , the us , rus@@ sia , and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting through in@@ action a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used .
that catastro@@ phe must be fore@@ st@@ alled .
as i , along with ge@@ or@@ ge p. sh@@ ul@@ tz , willi@@ am j@@ . per@@ ry , hen@@ ry a. k@@ is@@ singer , sam nun@@ n , and others , pointed out five years ago , nuclear deter@@ r@@ ence becomes less reliable and more ris@@ ky as the number of nu@@ clear@@ -@@ armed states increases .
bar@@ ring pre@@ emp@@ tive war ( which has proven counter@@ productive ) or effective sanctions ( which have thus far proven insufficient ) , only sincere steps toward nuclear dis@@ armament can fur@@ nis@@ h the mutual security needed to for@@ ge tough compromises on arms control and non@@ proliferation matters .
the trust and understanding built at re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k pav@@ ed the way for two historic treaties .
the 1987 intermedi@@ ate-@@ range nuclear forces ( in@@ f ) treaty destroyed the fe@@ ared quick@@ -@@ strike missi@@ les then threatening europ@@ e ’ s peace .
and , in 1991 , the first strategic arms reduction treaty ( start i ) cut the blo@@ ated us and so@@ vi@@ et nuclear ar@@ sen@@ als by 80 % over a decade .
but prospects for progress on arms control and non@@ proliferation are dark@@ ening in the absence of a credible push for nuclear dis@@ armament .
i learned during those two long days in re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k that dis@@ armament talks could be as constructive as they are ar@@ du@@ ous .
by linking an array of inter@@ related matters , re@@ ag@@ an and i built the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nu@@ clear@@ -@@ arms race of which we had lost control .
in retro@@ spec@@ t , the cold war ’ s end her@@ al@@ ded the coming of a mes@@ si@@ er arrangement of global power and persu@@ asion .
the nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the 1968 non-@@ proliferation treaty and resume “ good faith ” negotiations for dis@@ armament .
this would au@@ gment the diplomatic and moral capital available to diplom@@ ats as they strive to restra@@ in nuclear proliferation in a world where more countries than ever have the where@@ with@@ al to construct a nuclear bom@@ b .
only a serious program of universal nuclear dis@@ armament can provide the re@@ assurance and the credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deter@@ r@@ ence is a dead doc@@ tr@@ ine .
we can no longer afford , politically or financially , the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear “ ha@@ ves ” and “ ha@@ ve-@@ no@@ ts . ”
conditions were far from favor@@ able for a dis@@ armament deal in 1986 .
before i became so@@ vi@@ et leader in 1985 , relations between the cold war super@@ powers had hit rock bottom .
re@@ ag@@ an and i were nonetheless able to create a reser@@ voir of constructive spirit through constant ou@@ tre@@ ach and fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face interaction .
what seem to be lacking today are leaders with the bol@@ dness and vision to build the trust needed to re@@ introduce nuclear dis@@ armament as the c@@ enter@@ piece of a peaceful global order .
economic constraints and the cher@@ nobyl disaster helped sp@@ ur us to action .
why has the great recession and the disastrous mel@@ t@@ down at fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima da@@ i@@ i@@ chi in jap@@ an not e@@ lic@@ ited a similar response today ?
a first step would be for the us finally to ratify the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty ( c@@ t@@ bt ) .
president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama has endorsed this treaty as a vital instrument to dis@@ courage proliferation and aver@@ t nuclear war .
it ’ s time for ob@@ ama to make good on commitments he made in pra@@ gue in 2009 , take up re@@ ag@@ an ’ s man@@ tle as great communic@@ ator , and persuade the us sen@@ ate to form@@ alize ameri@@ ca ’ s adher@@ ence to the c@@ t@@ bt .
this would comp@@ el the remaining hol@@ dou@@ ts – ch@@ ina , eg@@ yp@@ t , indi@@ a , in@@ don@@ esia , ir@@ an , isra@@ el , north korea , and pak@@ istan – to re@@ consider the c@@ t@@ bt as well .
that would bring us closer to a global ban on nuclear tests in any environment – the atmosphere , under@@ sea , in outer space , or underground .
a second necessary step is for the us and rus@@ sia to follow up on the new start agreement and begin deeper weapons cuts , especially tac@@ tical and reserve weapons , which serve no purpose , waste funds , and threaten security .
this step must be related to limits on missi@@ le defense , one of the key issues that under@@ mined the re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k summit .
a fis@@ si@@ le material cut@@ -@@ off treaty ( f@@ m@@ ct ) , long st@@ alled in multilateral talks in gen@@ eva , and a successful second nuclear security summit next year in se@@ oul , will help secure dangerous nuclear materials .
this will also require that the 2002 global partnership , dedicated to securing and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction – nuclear , chemical , and biological – is renewed and expanded when it conven@@ es next year in the us .
our world remains too milit@@ ari@@ zed .
in today ’ s economic climate , nuclear weapons have become lo@@ ath@@ some money p@@ its .
if , as seems likely , economic troub@@ les continue , the us , rus@@ sia , and other nuclear powers should sei@@ ze the moment to launch multilateral arms reductions through new or existing channels such as the un conference on dis@@ armament .
these deliber@@ ations would yield greater security for less money .
but the buil@@ du@@ p of conventional military forces – driven in large part by the enormous military might deployed globally by the us – must be addressed as well .
as we engage in fur@@ ther@@ ing our conventional forces in europ@@ e ( c@@ fe ) agreement , we should seriously consider reducing the burden of military budgets and forces globally .
us president j@@ oh@@ n f. ken@@ ne@@ dy once warned that “ every man , woman , and child lives under a nuclear s@@ word of dam@@ oc@@ les , hang@@ ing by the s@@ len@@ der@@ est of th@@ reads , capable of being cut at any moment . ” for more than 50 years , humanity has war@@ ily e@@ yed that le@@ th@@ al pen@@ dul@@ um while stat@@ es@@ men debated how to mend its fra@@ ying cor@@ ds .
the example of re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k should remind us that pal@@ li@@ ative measures are not enough .
our efforts 25 years ago can be v@@ indicated only when the bom@@ b ends up beside the sla@@ ve tra@@ der ’ s man@@ ac@@ les and the great war ’ s mu@@ st@@ ard gas in the museum of by@@ gone sav@@ ag@@ ery .
affir@@ m@@ ative action for europ@@ e
the violence in fran@@ ce , fu@@ eled by stag@@ gering unemployment and ru@@ th@@ less polic@@ ing , reflects the utter failure of the f@@ ren@@ ch model of social integration .
but violence elsewhere in europ@@ e , such as the lon@@ don bom@@ b@@ ings of ju@@ ly and the brutal murder of dut@@ ch fil@@ m@@ maker the@@ o van go@@ gh on the streets of am@@ ster@@ dam in nov@@ ember 2004 , had already made europ@@ e ’ s failure to integrate its minorities pain@@ fully clear .
as the ri@@ ots in fran@@ ce fa@@ de , f@@ ren@@ ch politicians are agon@@ izing about how to proceed .
for@@ ty years ago , after legal seg@@ reg@@ ation of bl@@ acks and wh@@ ites formally ended in ameri@@ ca , the united states was confronted by similar problems .
ameri@@ ca ’ s response shows , however , that integration cannot be viewed as a one-@@ way street .
in addition to imposing demands and constraints on minorities to join the main@@ stream , society must be willing to demand of itself that it make room for all its citizens .
as a potential model to be followed , europ@@ e should look at the so-called “ affir@@ m@@ ative action ” policies that ameri@@ ca en@@ acted to provide opportunities to bl@@ acks .
affir@@ m@@ ative action , or “ positive discrimination , ” as some have called these policies , began with university ad@@ missions .
but , in the early 1970 ’ s , president rich@@ ard m. ni@@ x@@ on expanded the scope of affir@@ m@@ ative action .
as a result , eth@@ ni@@ city began to be weigh@@ ed as a positive factor not only in university ad@@ missions , but also in public procurement decisions , credit facilities for small enterprises , and government h@@ iring .
the rational for affir@@ m@@ ative action in those early years was the fact that , after a long history of system@@ ic in@@ justice , merely out@@ la@@ wing discrimination based on race or gender would not ensure equal opportunity for all .
such programs are often viewed as contradic@@ ting a basic ameri@@ can value , namely that ad@@ missions , lending , and h@@ iring decisions should be based on the merits of the individual , not group distinc@@ tions .
but they remain in existence three decades later .
indeed , leading ameri@@ can companies , like general mo@@ tors , general electric , and wal@@ mar@@ t , have created affir@@ m@@ ative action programs for h@@ iring and selecting suppliers at their own initiative .
simil@@ arly , anch@@ or@@ men and anch@@ or@@ women from all ethnic back@@ grounds popul@@ ate ameri@@ can television news programs .
in fran@@ ce , by contrast , the appointment of the black anch@@ or@@ woman au@@ dre@@ y pul@@ var was big news on its own , because most of her colleagues in fran@@ ce are white .
affir@@ m@@ ative action in the us has been effective in creating a large afri@@ can@@ -@@ ameri@@ can middle class .
the percentage of black households ear@@ ning over $ 50@@ ,000 a year ( adjusted for inflation ) has more than tri@@ pled over the last four decades , from 9.@@ 1 % in 1967 to 27.@@ 8 % in 2001 .
indeed , in the us , more people of color and women hold top jobs in the public and private sector than anywhere else in the world .
the fact that a large black under@@ class remains – something the recent floods in new or@@ le@@ ans revealed in a hor@@ ri@@ fically dramatic way – is mainly the result of failing school systems .
affir@@ m@@ ative action programs , of course , have always been vulnerable to attack by those who can ’ t benefit from them .
in 2003 , a white student asked the us su@@ preme court to declare that the use of race in the university of mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an ’ s admission policies viol@@ ated the equal protection clause of the four@@ teenth amendment of the us constitution .
the su@@ preme court , however , ruled that the program was constitutional , c@@ iting a “ comp@@ elling state interest ” in ra@@ cial diversity .
“ effective participation by members of all ra@@ cial and ethnic groups in the civil life of our nation , ” the court said , “ is essential if the dream of one nation , indi@@ visible , is to be realized . ”
in reaching its decision , the su@@ preme court took into account a legal brief submitted by 60 major ameri@@ can businesses , led by general mo@@ tors , asking that affir@@ m@@ ative action be uph@@ eld .
they argued that the skills needed in today ’ s global market@@ place can only be developed through exposure to a wide diversity of people .
reti@@ red military officers and comm@@ anders told the court that affir@@ m@@ ative action was essential to maintaining an integrated officer cor@@ ps .
what ameri@@ ca ’ s affir@@ m@@ ative action programs may not do is set quotas for minorities , as this prevents competition between different groups .
but , in compar@@ ing groups , it is permitted to use an individual ’ s status as member of an under-@@ represented minority in his or her favor .
as a result , a university may select a black student with a satisfactory score on the ad@@ missions test , even if there is a white student with a better score .
from the current f@@ ren@@ ch view@@ point , however , laws and regulations based on eth@@ ni@@ city are regarded as an un@@ welcome en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ment on the re@@ publi@@ can ideal .
f@@ ren@@ ch president j@@ acqu@@ es chi@@ rac veh@@ e@@ ment@@ ly op@@ poses quotas for immigrants , out of fear that such a policy would sti@@ g@@ mati@@ ze groups .
and f@@ ren@@ ch businesses don ’ t see it as their role to solve the problems of the sub@@ ur@@ bs .
moreover , f@@ ren@@ ch interior minister ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy h@@ as@@ n ’ t done much except hand out some special grants to the sm@@ art@@ est immigrants from the sub@@ ur@@ bs .
fran@@ ce does have affir@@ m@@ ative action programs , but they address poverty , not eth@@ ni@@ city .
if europ@@ ean politicians are serious about preventing a sch@@ ism between population groups , affir@@ m@@ ative action is essential – not only at the workplace , but also for small business loans , home loans , public procurement , and school ad@@ missions .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir , who in ju@@ ly was faced with the shortcomings of integration in the uk , should take advantage of the country ’ s current presidency of the europ@@ ean union to make affir@@ m@@ ative action programs the top priority at next month ’ s summit of europ@@ ean government leaders in br@@ ussel@@ s .
affordable green energy
cop@@ enhagen – public skep@@ tic@@ ism about global warming may be growing , but the scientific consensus is as solid as ever : man@@ -@@ made climate change is real , and we ignore it at our peri@@ l .
but if that issue is settled ( and it should be ) , there is an equally large and important question that remains wide open : what should we do about it ?
one pres@@ cription that is ban@@ died about with increasing frequency certainly sounds sensible : the world should dras@@ tically cut the amount of greenhouse gases that it pum@@ ps into the atmosphere each day .
specifically , we are told , the goal should be a 50 % reduction in global car@@ b@@ on-@@ dioxide emissions by the middle of the century .
even its back@@ ers conc@@ ede that achieving this target won ’ t be easy – and they are right .
in fact , they are so right that they are wrong .
allow me to explain .
our dependen@@ cy on car@@ b@@ on-@@ emit@@ ting fuels is more than enormous .
it is overwhelming .
for all the talk about solar , wind , and other h@@ yp@@ ed gre@@ en-@@ energy sources , they make up only 0.@@ 6 % of global energy consumption .
renewable energy overwhel@@ m@@ ingly comes from o@@ f@@ ten-@@ un@@ sustainable burning of wood and biom@@ ass by people in the third world .
fossil fuels account for more than four-@@ fif@@ ths of the world ’ s energy diet .
so , in order to cut global carbon emissions in half by the middle of the century , we would obviously have to start getting a lot more of our energy from sources that don ’ t em@@ it carbon .
can we do this ?
according to the international energy agency , here ’ s what it would take to achieve the goal of cutting emissions by 50 % between now and mid-@@ century :
now consider this : this list does not describe what we would have to build between now and 2050 , but what we would have to build each and every year until then !
one more thing : even if we managed to do all this ( which we obviously cannot ) , the impact on global temperatures would be hardly notic@@ eable by 2050 .
according to the best-@@ known cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ economic model , this vast undertaking would likely wind up reducing global temperatures by just one-@@ tent@@ h of one degree c@@ enti@@ grade ( one-@@ fifth of one degree fahr@@ enheit ) , while holding back se@@ a-@@ level rises by only one cen@@ tim@@ eter ( less than half an inch ) .
that ’ s not a lot of b@@ ang for the bu@@ ck .
indeed , the projected costs of this approach – some $ 5 tril@@ lion annually by mid-@@ century – are so much greater than its likely benefits that it makes no sense to call it a solution at all .
fortunately , there is a better , sm@@ ar@@ ter way to deal with global warming . what if , instead of spending tril@@ li@@ ons of dollars trying to build an impossible number of power plants – or , more likely , condem@@ ning billions of people around the world to continued poverty by trying to make car@@ b@@ on-@@ emit@@ ting fuels too expensive to use – we devoted ourselves to making green energy cheaper ?
right now , solar panels are so expensive – about 10 times more than fossil fuels in terms of cost per unit of energy output – that only well-@@ he@@ eled , well-@@ meaning ( and , usually , well-@@ subsidi@@ zed ) west@@ ern@@ ers can afford to install them .
but think where we ’ d be if we could improve the efficiency of solar cells by a factor of ten – in other words , if we could make them cheaper than fossil fuels .
we w@@ ouldn ’ t have to force ( or subsidi@@ ze ) anyone to stop burning coal and oil .
everyone , including the chin@@ ese and the indi@@ ans , would shift to the cheaper and clean@@ er alternatives – and global emission targets would automatically be met .
can we achieve this technological mi@@ racle over the next 20 to 40 years ?
in a word , yes .
the price of solar energy has been dro@@ pping steadily for 30 years – by about 50 % every decade – and we could likely accelerate that decline further with sufficiently large investments in research and development .
how large ?
if we were willing to devote just 0.@@ 2 % of global g@@ d@@ p ( roughly $ 100 billion a year ) to gre@@ en-@@ energy r &@@ amp@@ ; d , i believe that we could bring about gam@@ e-@@ changing break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s not just for solar power , but also for a wide variety of other altern@@ ativ@@ e-@@ energy technologies .
this belief in the potential of technological progress strikes some climate activists as na@@ ï@@ ve or even del@@ u@@ sional .
but is it really ?
consider one of the mi@@ ra@@ cles of the modern age – the personal computer .
these devices didn ’ t become household items because governments subsidi@@ zed purchases or forced up the price of ty@@ pe@@ writers and slide rules .
no , what happened is that , largely as a result of the space race , the united states government p@@ oured lots of money into r &@@ amp@@ ; d for soli@@ d-@@ state physi@@ cs and electronics engineering .
the resulting break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s not only got nei@@ l arm@@ strong to the moon in 1969 , but also made it possible for app@@ le to introduce the first ma@@ c in 1976 and i@@ b@@ m to de@@ but the first p@@ c five years later .
we can do the same for clean energy .
forget about subsidi@@ zing in@@ efficient technologies or making fossil fuels too expensive to use .
instead , let ’ s fund the basic research that will make green energy too cheap and easy to resist .
afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s custom@@ ary an@@ gu@@ ish
far@@ ah , afgh@@ an@@ istan – when the problems ri@@ dd@@ ling afgh@@ an society are listed – violence , in@@ security , corruption , religious fundament@@ alism – one domin@@ ating factor is usually left out : the influence of custom@@ ary law .
in afgh@@ an@@ istan , there are three principal legal references : constitutional law , the kor@@ an , and the system of custom@@ ary law known as far@@ hang , the most dominant and stric@@ test version of which is called pas@@ h@@ tun@@ wal@@ i ( the way of the pas@@ ht@@ uns ) .
originally an ancient honor code , far@@ hang ensures the domin@@ ance of the oldest male of any household , followed by married sons , un@@ married sons , and grand@@ sons , then wi@@ ves ( with the yo@@ ung@@ est at the bottom ) .
collective decisions are taken by patri@@ ar@@ chs in coun@@ cils called j@@ ir@@ gas , where all have to be in agreement .
everything else is left to patri@@ arch@@ al discretion . here , no one will intervene except to reinforce the application of the patri@@ arch &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s rights – say , in st@@ oning a sup@@ pose@@ dly wa@@ y@@ ward girl , or turning a blind eye to so-called “ honor k@@ ill@@ ings ” of women .
every act of an afgh@@ an male ’ s life is integrated in a form of reciproc@@ ity , in which nothing is free .
mel@@ mas@@ tia , the basic ten@@ et of hospitality means “ i will give you shel@@ ter if you ask me to , even if you are a fu@@ gi@@ tive mur@@ derer ; but , in exchange , you fight my batt@@ les . ” this sense of custom@@ ary obligation is why so many of president ham@@ id kar@@ z@@ ai ’ s c@@ ron@@ ies remain in place and tali@@ ban leaders remain safe .
women are excluded from collective decision-making , as they are mere objects .
girls are literally sold upon marriage ( the father is paid money for his daughter ’ s labor and re@@ productive capacity ) and join their husband ’ s household .
the younger the girl , the higher the price .
marriage , especially in the provin@@ ces , is rout@@ inely consu@@ mm@@ ated on pre-@@ pu@@ bes@@ cent bodies .
yet women are precious in their own way .
a family ’ s principal “ cultural capital ” is its honor , which is ensured by den@@ ying women any opportunity to highlight male fail@@ ings and therefore tar@@ nis@@ h cl@@ an respec@@ tability .
as a result , women must be strictly sec@@ lu@@ ded and made inv@@ isi@@ ble when in public , for they are personally responsible for the desire that they could ign@@ ite in schools , hospitals , parks , or markets .
the all-@@ covering bur@@ q@@ a ensures sufficient anony@@ m@@ ity to permit women a certain amount of freedom in public space .
every female simultaneously carries her father ’ s and her husband ’ s honor , and will sto@@ ically submit to all forms of violence committed in its name .
this may mean dying in child@@ birth rather than ris@@ king the “ dis@@ honor ” of giving birth in a public place , a hospital , in front of stran@@ gers .
going to court is practically un@@ heard of , as it would mean ren@@ oun@@ cing family practices .
from the male point of view , res@@ or@@ ting to outside police or judicial intervention would signi@@ fy an in@@ ability to fight one ’ s own batt@@ les – an admission of defeat and a symbolic ca@@ str@@ ation .
this helps explain the intense corruption present in afgh@@ an courts , where “ honor ” can be re@@ deemed by bri@@ bing a judge to have a rap@@ ist or mur@@ derer released . as violence is strictly a private matter , re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ishing justice to state institutions could be an unacceptable hum@@ ili@@ ation .
custom@@ ary law is not rigi@@ d in that it is made to fit round the demands of global economy .
it has become more rigorous in it s applications due to the influence o@@ f@@ milit@@ ant is@@ lam , which seeks to use religious texts to legitim@@ ize escal@@ ating brut@@ ality , especially against women .
however , far@@ hang and privati@@ zed violence are precisely what mo@@ ham@@ mad sought to ban through kor@@ an@@ ic law , which went beyond the personal domain and in@@ stituted a code that gave some rights to women .
for example , while the kor@@ an allows for a measure of female inher@@ it@@ ance , tri@@ bal custom does not authori@@ ze it , which explains the popularity of tri@@ bal coun@@ cils to resolve inher@@ it@@ ance problems and che@@ at women out of their rights .
simil@@ arly , whereas the kor@@ an requires four e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses as proof of adul@@ ter@@ y , mere suspici@@ on of some un@@ regulated , potentially sexual conduct by a woman war@@ rants st@@ oning under custom@@ ary law .
yet an awareness of alternatives is se@@ eping in through the media , even in remote provin@@ ces .
ir@@ anian films and the much loved indi@@ an tv seri@@ als , not to mention the occa@@ sional ameri@@ can film , influence peoples &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; expectations .
add to that the experience of having lived abroad as refugees in pak@@ istan and ir@@ an .
girls know that there are options to an unacceptable way of life : women are increasingly demanding more from life than what custom or@@ da@@ ins .
this is especially true for those who have lived in ir@@ an , a totally mus@@ li@@ m environment that allows women the freedom to study and work as well as access to adequate healthcare and family planning .
once back in rural afgh@@ an@@ istan , forced into brutal marri@@ ages , many desper@@ ate women – especially re@@ tur@@ ne@@ es from ir@@ an – resort to self-@@ imm@@ ol@@ ation .
violence and murder of women are on the increase , perpet@@ rated by men who feel that these alternatives pose a threat to their authority .
the west ima@@ g@@ ines that religion is the central issue in afgh@@ an@@ istan .
but the heart of the matter is the preservation of ancient patri@@ arch@@ al rights that go back to bi@@ b@@ lical times , reform@@ at@@ ted to fit the demands of glob@@ alized capitalism .
governments and international aid organizations have failed to take into consideration the role of far@@ hang , perhaps because the power of un@@ written law remains largely in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable in the west .
but afgh@@ an@@ istan cannot begin to solve its many problems until it crimin@@ ali@@ zes the privati@@ zed violence of this anti@@ qu@@ ated code .
afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s president ham@@ id kar@@ z@@ ai has step@@ ped up international f@@ und@@ raising efforts in recent weeks , seeking a fresh package of military and reconstruction aid from the united states , together with stronger strategic guarantees .
but kar@@ z@@ ai ’ s relationship with his spons@@ ors has begun to s@@ our , in part owing to charges that his government has failed to stop the res@@ ur@@ gence of afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s huge op@@ ium trade .
underlying the op@@ ium trade issue is a security threat of another kind , one over@@ looked since the us-@@ led invasion top@@ pled the tali@@ ban regime in 2001 , despite the grave risk it poses to afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s long-term stability , and that of the region .
in countries like afgh@@ an@@ istan , where 80 % of the population lives on what they grow and many communities live far from any water source , environmental damage can be both economically devastating and politically moment@@ ous .
that lesson should have been absor@@ bed and understood , not least by ameri@@ can strateg@@ ists , long before the tali@@ ban ’ s fall .
after all , deser@@ ti@@ fication and de@@ fore@@ station helped fuel the rise , two decades earlier , of the ma@@ o@@ ist gu@@ er@@ illa group sen@@ der@@ o l@@ umin@@ o@@ so ( sh@@ ining path ) in per@@ u .
sen@@ der@@ o , which supple@@ mented its income with drug production and timber smug@@ gling , deliberately chose d@@ rou@@ ght-@@ weak@@ ened and de@@ fore@@ sted mountain villages as the stron@@ gh@@ old of its ins@@ urgency .
simil@@ arly , the ma@@ o@@ ist ins@@ urgency in ne@@ p@@ al , which has claimed 10,000 lives , explo@@ its the desper@@ ation of mountain vil@@ lag@@ ers hit by flash floods – the result of de@@ fore@@ station higher up .
no ma@@ o@@ ist group could ever gain a to@@ ehold in afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s par@@ ched pas@@ h@@ tun south ( these were , after all , people who , bare@@ -@@ k@@ nu@@ ck@@ led , sm@@ ash@@ ed the so@@ vi@@ ets ) .
but the tali@@ ban ’ s rapid rise in the 1990 ’ s was in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably linked to the failure of ir@@ rig@@ ation systems .
vil@@ lag@@ ers whose crops sh@@ ri@@ vel@@ ed and whose livestock died in a prolong@@ ed d@@ rought saw joining the tali@@ ban as an economic opportunity .
had there been more ir@@ rig@@ ation , the tali@@ ban ’ s gains might have been far less impressive .
the tali@@ ban are now an increasingly spent force , but lack of water reinforced the logic of op@@ ium production across its former stron@@ gh@@ olds in the south .
ir@@ rig@@ ation has failed or is inadequate in hel@@ m@@ and , ur@@ u@@ z@@ gan , and k@@ and@@ a@@ har – three of the top five op@@ i@@ um-@@ producing provin@@ ces – where in@@ deb@@ ted farmers are ho@@ oked by the economics : op@@ ium brings in eight times as much cash as whe@@ at and uses less water .
without serious investment in ir@@ rig@@ ation , including construction of reser@@ vo@@ irs to make use of the snow@@ fall in the hin@@ du k@@ ush , and in new cash crops such as sa@@ ff@@ ron and rose oil , afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s dri@@ ft toward nar@@ co-@@ stat@@ eh@@ ood will continue , with all the instability that this implies .
clear@@ -@@ cutting of old growth forests in the mountains bor@@ dering pak@@ istan may prove as problematic .
agriculture there has been damaged by the cutting of wal@@ nu@@ t , ap@@ ri@@ co@@ t , and mul@@ berry trees for winter fuel , and by a failure to re@@ plant pop@@ lar , wil@@ low , and tam@@ ar@@ isk – the trees that hold fragile me@@ ado@@ ws in place .
these sorts of trees can be restored , given a concer@@ ted campaign and investment in nur@@ series to produce local varieties .
loss of the ancient c@@ ed@@ ar , pine , fi@@ r , and o@@ ak forests on the slopes above is another matter .
this year ’ s snow@@ melt caused lands@@ li@@ des and floo@@ ding – a warning of more soil ero@@ sion and destruction of ar@@ able land to come ; hundreds died and thousands lost their live@@ li@@ hoods .
forestry has always been a problem in afgh@@ an@@ istan .
in 1960 , the united nations food and agriculture organization spoke of wa@@ ste@@ ful log@@ ging practices , such as “ head@@ -@@ sk@@ id@@ ding ” ( in which a log is rolled down@@ hill , ri@@ pping up plants and soil ) .
but , in 1976 , the fa@@ o admitted in a new plan that forest and water@@ shed management activities had “ turned out to be quite limited . ”
the 1976 plan called for sustainable log@@ ging and basic fore@@ st-@@ fire control , but war interven@@ ed , co@@ sting afgh@@ an@@ istan half its forest cover .
up to 60 % of the old growth forest in n@@ an@@ ga@@ har , the second largest op@@ i@@ um-@@ producing province , may have been cut during the war years .
mu@@ jah@@ edi@@ n fac@@ tions and later the tali@@ ban exported stands of fin@@ e-@@ gra@@ ined c@@ ed@@ ar by the tru@@ ck@@ load from n@@ an@@ ga@@ har and surrounding provin@@ ces to pak@@ istan , often in return for arms .
illegal log@@ ging continues today , with only in@@ effec@@ tual efforts made to stop it .
at the current rate , afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s old growth forest could van@@ ish within a decade .
the un acknowledges the problem but is ( rightly ) un@@ willing to risk sending forestry experts into a tri@@ bal region where ameri@@ can and al@@ lied troops venture only in ar@@ mo@@ red con@@ vo@@ ys .
safety concerns and cost also limit intervention by international conservation organizations .
a new initiative called the green cor@@ ps includes 300 forest ran@@ gers charged with st@@ opping illegal log@@ ging , and the ministr@@ y hopes to boost their numbers within a year .
but the initiative is unlikely to have much effect .
illegal log@@ ging cre@@ ws number 200 or more .
they have chain sa@@ ws and trucks .
they are armed and work with the backing of drug and emer@@ ald smug@@ gl@@ ers – and often of local officials .
the price of pl@@ ank c@@ ed@@ ar in la@@ h@@ ore is incentive enough to cor@@ rupt , or kill , any green cor@@ ps men bra@@ ve enough to stand in their way .
environmental issues are of par@@ amount importance in margin@@ al countries because their impact on human survival is immediate and direct .
the inadequate response to pressing questions of natural resource management , whether of water or trees , merely strengthens the hands of op@@ ium dealers and mal@@ contents in what is already the most dis@@ affected and sensitive part of afgh@@ an@@ istan – the clear@@ -@@ cut mountain slopes where intelligence officers believe o@@ sam@@ a bin laden is most likely hol@@ ed up .
roughly 75 % of afgh@@ an new@@ bor@@ ns that die do so because of lack of food , warm@@ th , and care .
un@@ loved little girls fare the worst .
in afgh@@ an@@ istan as a whole , a woman dies of pregn@@ anc@@ y-@@ related causes every 27 minutes – and perhaps even more frequently , because many such deaths go un@@ recorded .
many , perhaps most , are under six@@ teen years of age .
the tali@@ ban – bl@@ amed nowadays for just about all of afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s ills – have officially been gone for nearly seven years , so why are conditions still so ab@@ ys@@ mal ?
in kab@@ ul and her@@ at , mobile phones abo@@ und , a to@@ oth@@ -@@ ero@@ ding con@@ co@@ ction called “ afgh@@ an col@@ a ” is sold , the internet works ( sometimes ) , there are at@@ m machines , sophisticated her@@ o@@ in labor@@ atories , four-@@ wheel drive vehicles , five-@@ star hotels , ads for private banks – all the tra@@ pp@@ ings of glob@@ alized modern@@ ity .
yet so many women die like f@@ lies , in pools of blood and deep@@ -@@ roo@@ ted in@@ difference .
while billions of dollars in aid have led to improvements in urban areas , where health facilities have been built and mid@@ wi@@ ves trained , the overall mat@@ ern@@ al death figures have hardly changed .
as one doctor told me : “ a competent mid@@ wife or nur@@ se would rather be out of work in kab@@ ul than stu@@ ck in a remote village . ” but most afgh@@ ans live in remote villages – those in bad@@ akh@@ sh@@ an can be reached only after a day ’ s b@@ ump@@ y ride on a don@@ key .
this mis@@ er@@ able situation has been attributed to various causes , mainly lack of infrastructure and local economic conditions .
but cultural questions must also be addressed , because gender discrimination is the most important cause of mat@@ ern@@ al mortality .
in afgh@@ an society , discrimination begins at birth .
one obvious reason is that a boy is dest@@ ined to support his parents and much of his family all his life , and therefore represents a long-term investment , whereas a girl will be given over to her husband ’ s family as soon as possible .
feeding a girl is seen as effectively looking after someone else ’ s property .
once , i heard a d@@ read@@ ful story of a bre@@ ech birth which a traditional mid@@ wife did not know how to handle .
in the end , she w@@ ren@@ ched the baby ’ s body out , sever@@ ing it from its head , which remained inside the mother ’ s wom@@ b .
it took six days to get the woman to a hospital in j@@ al@@ al@@ ab@@ ad though it was not very far from where she lived .
she som@@ ehow survi@@ ved , with major health comp@@ lications , including permanent f@@ ist@@ ula , which will condemn her to a life of exclusion from her family and un@@ relie@@ ved mis@@ ery .
that tragedy can be read on many levels , each more hear@@ t-@@ ren@@ ding than the next .
but note that it occurred near a health facility .
as soon as the mid@@ wife saw that the baby was coming out feet forward , she must have known that there was little she could do to save either mother or baby .
even before that , she would have noticed that the child had not turned properly , and that major problems were on the way .
this means that someone – a husband or mo@@ ther@@ -in-@@ law – had taken the decision not to send the young woman to the hospital , instead keeping her in in@@ human suffering for nearly a week .
the solution is not just to build more hospitals , but also to change deep@@ -@@ roo@@ ted dis@@ da@@ in for women .
and , sad@@ ly , things have become worse in the past 30 years , as afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s particular brand of is@@ lam , combined with its legacy of di@@ re poverty and war , compo@@ unds an already mis@@ og@@ yn@@ ist pre-@@ islam@@ ic tradition .
mat@@ ern@@ al mortality is a sin@@ ister consequence of this complex situation .
the legal system , schools , and the media could bring change , but no official entity takes the problem seriously enough to initiate effective action .
the central reason is des@@ pa@@ ir@@ ingly simple : women ’ s lives are not valued , and even women themselves perc@@ eive their suffering as being un@@ avoid@@ able .
what afgh@@ an@@ istan needs is an in@@ quest after each death and laws making it a criminal offen@@ se to for@@ bid access to medical aid , when available , to women and children ( or , more correctly , to children and their children , given that girls are often married by age 14 ) .
pris@@ ons , i fear , would be full of abu@@ sive hus@@ bands and , i regret to say , ven@@ ge@@ ful mo@@ ther@@ s-@@ in-@@ law .
health education through public media , reaching distant areas of the country , is an urgent priority , but has been utter@@ ly ignored in favor of commercial priorities .
ques@@ tioning culture is , of course , a politically incorrect approach .
but we must refuse to bo@@ w before the altar of tolerance when it comes to what is truly unacceptable , wherever it occurs , and this is what the world is witness@@ ing pas@@ sively in afgh@@ an@@ istan .
does diversity authori@@ ze such brutal deaths and sen@@ sel@@ ess violence against women simply because some sup@@ pose@@ dly traditional practice allows them to be married before their bodies are ready and den@@ ies them health care when they give birth ?
the fight against mat@@ ern@@ al mortality in afgh@@ an@@ istan must become a global priority .
ultimately , a society that allows women to be brut@@ alized will remain a breeding ground of gener@@ alized violence .
on ap@@ ri@@ l 16 , more than 300 afgh@@ ani women – many of them students – mar@@ ched together in kab@@ ul in protest of a new law passed by parliament that would impose a series of tali@@ ban@@ -@@ like restrictions on women .
the law would permit mar@@ ital rap@@ e , limit women ’ s movements – say , for work or study – without male permission , and even make it illegal for a woman to refuse to dress as her husband wishes .
the women , facing a crow@@ d of fur@@ ious men calling them “ wh@@ o@@ res ” and other ep@@ i@@ th@@ ets , mar@@ ched two miles under a rain of abuse and delivered their peti@@ tion against the law to legislat@@ ors .
both houses of parliament had approved the law , and president ham@@ id kar@@ z@@ ai signed it .
the law now affects only the shi@@ a minority , but threat@@ ens to affect pending legislation that could restrict the rights of non-@@ shi@@ a women as well .
when western media sought quo@@ tes from the women , they frequently heard a west@@ ern@@ -@@ style femin@@ ist refrain : “ these laws would make women into a kind of property . ”
in the west , the counter@@ point to the notion of woman as property has been a highly individu@@ alistic demand for personal autonomy – decision-making based primarily on a woman ’ s own wishes , rather than as wife , mother , community member , or wor@@ shi@@ pper .
but , while some western femin@@ ist in@@ sights may be useful to afgh@@ ani women and other women in the developing world as they resist certain forms of male op@@ pression , we should not assume – as western femin@@ ists often have – that our job is to pro@@ sel@@ y@@ ti@@ ze “ our ” femin@@ ism .
on the contrary , the femin@@ ism expressed by women such as these afgh@@ ani her@@ o@@ ines should educ@@ ate us in the west about our own shortcomings .
the core theory with which emerging femin@@ ists in more traditional and religious societies are working is far different from that of western femin@@ ism – and in some ways far more profound and humane .
in indi@@ a , for example , femin@@ ists articul@@ ated to me a vision of women ’ s equality that was family-@@ c@@ entered rather than self-@@ c@@ entered , and that valued service to community rather than personal grati@@ fication .
they did not see their struggle as a cultural or ideological clas@@ h between men and women , but rather as a very practical effort to live free from violence and sexual ass@@ ault , forced child marriage and bri@@ de-@@ burning , and legal exclusion from par@@ ity .
the emerging consensus in indi@@ a in support of greater rights and freedoms for women , while certainly causing some up@@ heav@@ al and adjustment ( especially within the growing middle classes ) has not yet – and might never – po@@ ison the basic trust and warm@@ th between men and women .
nor does it seem likely to em@@ ul@@ ate the sp@@ lin@@ tered , individu@@ alized , sol@@ it@@ ary society – and the commo@@ di@@ fied sexual revolution – that western , self-@@ based femin@@ ism reflects .
this version of femin@@ ism – the notion that women can claim equality and still have a valued role in the home , prize family above all , and view rights in the context of community and spiritu@@ ality – seems like a mu@@ ch-@@ needed correc@@ tive to some of western femin@@ ism ’ s shortcomings .
ideally , men ’ s drive for progress in the developing world would also evol@@ ve , un@@ iting the idea of the autonomous self with support for family , community , and other ties , and western men would learn from this as well .
moreover , intellec@@ tu@@ ally , these women remind us that western femin@@ ism did not have to evol@@ ve the way it did , and can still change and grow to embra@@ ce a more satis@@ fying and humane definition of equality .
sim@@ one de beau@@ voir , whose semin@@ al book the second sex laid the ground@@ work for post-@@ war western femin@@ ism , was an exist@@ enti@@ alist who was neither a wife nor a mother nor a woman of faith .
so her work naturally pos@@ ited female freedom in a sec@@ ular , sol@@ it@@ ary , and individu@@ alistic context , in which “ freedom ” means pure autonomy rather than integration within a whole – comprising family , community , and even go@@ d – on equal terms .
the good news for all women , east and west , is that president kar@@ z@@ ai , under intense international criticism – and not just western criticism – changed the law less than one week after the mar@@ ch .
this global u@@ pro@@ ar is a te@@ sta@@ ment to how three decades of western femin@@ ist challenges to leadership have changed the world for the better .
but our ( western ) moment of femin@@ ist leadership is over now – for good reasons .
we know by now what our problems are as women in the west , and we know the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int for solving them .
what we lack now is not analysis , but the organiz@@ ational and political will to do so .
so the leadership role is shi@@ fting to women in the developing world .
their agenda is more pressing , and their problems , frank@@ ly , far more serious than ours , which makes it much more urgent for them to develop the@@ ories appropriate to the challenges they face .
if one of those cour@@ age@@ ous afgh@@ an women who mar@@ ched in kab@@ ul wrote – as i hope she or one of her s@@ isters in the developing world is doing right now – the semin@@ al text for the next 50 years on non-@@ western femin@@ ism , it would no doubt be equ@@ al@@ ity-@@ driven and practical .
and perhaps , in its likely view of the world as being more than the sum of consu@@ ming , competing autonom@@ ies , or gender war@@ fare , it would be a valuable challenge to tru@@ isms that we western femin@@ ists – and the men who love us – have thought we had to take for granted .
when nat@@ o leaders meet for their summit in rig@@ a at the end of this month , there will be a g@@ host at the fe@@ ast : afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s op@@ ium .
afgh@@ an@@ istan is in danger of falling back into the hands of terrorists , insur@@ gen@@ ts , and criminals , and the multi-@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar op@@ ium trade is at the heart of the country ’ s mal@@ a@@ ise .
indeed , nat@@ o ’ s top general , j@@ ames j@@ ones , has called drugs the “ ach@@ illes he@@ el ” of afgh@@ an@@ istan .
this year ’ s record har@@ vest of 6,@@ 100 tons of op@@ ium will generate more than $ 3 billion in il@@ licit revenue – equivalent to almost half of afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s g@@ d@@ p .
profits for drug traffi@@ ckers down@@ stream will be almost 20 times that amount .
high-level col@@ lu@@ sion enables thousands of tons of chemical prec@@ urs@@ ors , needed to produce her@@ o@@ in , to be tru@@ cked into the country .
armed con@@ vo@@ ys transport raw op@@ ium around the country un@@ hin@@ dered .
sometimes even army and police vehicles are involved .
g@@ uns and bri@@ bes ensure that the trucks are wa@@ ved through check@@ points .
op@@ i@@ ates flow freely across borders into ir@@ an , pak@@ istan , and other central asi@@ an countries .
the op@@ ium fields of weal@@ thy land@@ owners are un@@ touched , because local officials are paid off .
major traffi@@ ckers never come to trial because judges are bri@@ bed or intim@@ id@@ ated .
senior government officials take their cut of op@@ ium revenues or bri@@ bes in return for keeping quiet .
per@@ ver@@ sely , some provin@@ cial govern@@ ors and government officials are themselves major players in the drug trade .
as a result , the afgh@@ an state is at risk of take@@ over by a mal@@ ign coalition of extremis@@ ts , criminals , and opport@@ un@@ ists .
op@@ ium is cho@@ king afgh@@ an society .
within afgh@@ an@@ istan , drug addi@@ ction is rising .
neigh@@ b@@ ors that used to be transit states for drugs are now major consumers , owing to similar dramatic increases in op@@ ium and her@@ o@@ in addi@@ ction .
in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use is spreading hi@@ v / aids in ir@@ an , central a@@ sia , and the former so@@ vi@@ et union .
in traditional western europ@@ ean markets , health officials should bra@@ ce for a rise in the number of deaths from drug over@@ do@@ ses , as this year ’ s b@@ um@@ per op@@ ium crop will lead to hig@@ her@@ -@@ p@@ urity do@@ ses of her@@ o@@ in .
what can be done ?
first , the v@@ eil of corruption in afgh@@ an@@ istan must be li@@ fted .
afgh@@ ans are fed up with arro@@ gan@@ t and well-@@ armed ty@@ co@@ ons who live in man@@ sions and drive top-@@ of-@@ the range mer@@ ce@@ des lim@@ ou@@ sin@@ es – this in a country where barely 13 % of the population have electricity and most people must survive on less than $ 200 a year .
it is time for the afgh@@ an government to name , shame , and s@@ ack cor@@ rupt officials , arrest major drug traffi@@ ckers and op@@ ium land@@ l@@ ords , and sei@@ ze their assets .
donors have trained police and prosec@@ ut@@ ors and built courts and detention centers .
now it is up to the government to use the judicial system to impose the rule of law .
it will be difficult , but not impossible , to re-@@ establish confidence in the central government .
putting major drug traffi@@ ckers behind bars at the new maxim@@ um-@@ security prison at pul@@ -@@ i-@@ ch@@ ark@@ i , near kab@@ ul , would be a good start .
of course , afgh@@ an@@ istan does not bear sole responsibility for its p@@ light .
the her@@ o@@ in trade would not be bo@@ oming if western governments were serious about combating drug consumption .
it is a bit@@ ter ir@@ ony that the countries whose soldiers ’ lives are on the line in afgh@@ an@@ istan are also the biggest markets for afgh@@ an her@@ o@@ in .
furthermore , afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s neigh@@ b@@ ors must do more to stop insur@@ gen@@ ts , weapons , money , and chemical prec@@ urs@@ ors from f@@ lowing across their borders into the country .
counter-@@ ins@@ urgency and counter-@@ nar@@ co@@ tics are two sides of the same coin .
improving security and the rule of law must include destroying the op@@ ium trade .
allowing op@@ ium traffi@@ ckers to operate with imp@@ unity gives them a free hand to raise money to pay for the arms and figh@@ ters batt@@ ling the afgh@@ an army and nat@@ o forces .
the united nations security council has authorized the international security assistance force to take all necessary measures to ful@@ fill its mandate .
nat@@ o troops should be given the green light to help the afgh@@ an army fight op@@ ium – destroy the her@@ o@@ in lab@@ s , dis@@ band the op@@ ium ba@@ za@@ ars , attack the op@@ ium con@@ vo@@ ys , and bring the big traders to justice .
and they should be given the tools and man@@ power to do the job .
there is no point in trying to win the hearts and minds of major drug traffi@@ ckers .
farmers are a different story .
forced eradication risks pushing farmers into the hands of extremis@@ ts , and thus will not lead to the sustainable reduction of op@@ ium fields .
indeed , as we have seen in some an@@ de@@ an countries , it can be counter-@@ productive .
therefore , security and development must go hand in hand .
to achieve this , afgh@@ an@@ istan needs more development assistance .
international support so far has been generous , but it is still well below per capita equi@@ val@@ ents for other post-@@ conflict situations – and the need is much greater .
farmers will be we@@ an@@ ed off op@@ ium over the long term only if they have sustainable live@@ li@@ hoods .
at the moment , afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s drug l@@ ords are prosp@@ ering , and rural communities are suffering .
that situation needs to be revers@@ ed .
we must pun@@ ish the traffi@@ ckers and reward the farmers .
we cannot afford to fail in afgh@@ an@@ istan .
recent history has given us graphic evidence of what would happen if we do .
but any solution in afgh@@ an@@ istan depends on eliminating its op@@ ium .
kab@@ ul – recently , the afgh@@ an independent human rights commission ( a@@ ihr@@ c ) office in ku@@ do@@ z province reported the rescue of a young woman who had been im@@ pris@@ oned in her in-@@ laws ’ d@@ unge@@ on for seven months .
fif@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old sa@@ har gu@@ l was forced to mar@@ ry an older man who serves in the afgh@@ an army .
she was then kept in the d@@ unge@@ on by her husband ’ s family and brut@@ ally tor@@ tured for months , because she refused to work as a pro@@ stitute .
over the past ten years , the a@@ ihr@@ c has received more than 19@@ ,000 complaints related to violence against women .
despite making some progress in investig@@ ating the complaints and referring them to the justice system , as well as in raising public awareness about the issue , the challenges remain huge .
since 2002 , many efforts have been made to improve women ’ s lives in afgh@@ an@@ istan .
but laws and policies alone are not sufficient to protect women from hor@@ ri@@ fic domestic abuse .
there was also g@@ ul@@ na@@ z , a young woman who was j@@ ailed for adul@@ ter@@ y after being rap@@ ed by a relative ( she was recently released after a presidential par@@ don , but may be forced to mar@@ ry her att@@ acker ) .
the husband of another young woman , a@@ ish@@ a , cut off her no@@ se and ears when she ran away .
violence against women in afgh@@ an@@ istan pers@@ ists for many reasons .
first , the country has inher@@ ited a patri@@ arch@@ al tri@@ bal tradition that assumes women ’ s inf@@ eri@@ ority .
women are therefore deprived of their basic rights and freedoms .
second , there is a strong political incentive to depri@@ ve women of their rights .
radical groups receive immense support from the large share of the population that op@@ poses women ’ s rights .
the tali@@ ban , for example , have consistently used an anti-@@ women policy to appeal to tri@@ bal and rural people .
third , family pride and honor are deemed more important than a woman ’ s individual well-being and safety .
for example , if family members beat or abuse a woman , she has few options .
often , her only choice is to remain silent or risk dis@@ gra@@ cing the family .
if she does report the matter to the authorities , the case will almost certainly never be properly investigated , nor the perpet@@ r@@ ators ever prosec@@ uted .
gu@@ l , for example , compla@@ ined to the police about her abu@@ sive in-@@ laws , but she was returned to the family when some of their influ@@ ential contacts interven@@ ed .
fourth , laws are often arbitr@@ arily applied , and sh@@ aria ( islam@@ ic law ) frequently takes prece@@ dence over civil legislation , resulting in widespread imp@@ unity for crimes of violence against women .
for example , in oc@@ tober 2010 , the afgh@@ an su@@ preme court ruled that women who run away from home can be charged with prostitution , unless they go to the police or an immediate relative &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s home . it is this min@@ d@@ set that led to gu@@ l ’ s vic@@ tim@@ ization .
finally , while the tali@@ ban lost power ten years ago , discrimination and violence against women has occurred in afgh@@ an society for centuries .
thus , despite some progress , public and official sensitivity to violence against women is only slowly emerging .
the afgh@@ an government must take several steps to protect women fully .
above all , perpet@@ r@@ ators of violence against women should be prosec@@ uted and tried under due process of law .
this will require strengthening the rule of law and ending the prev@@ ailing culture of imp@@ unity .
that , in turn , requires educ@@ ating the public further about human rights and women ’ s rights through school text@@ books , continuing education courses , and a vig@@ orous media campaign .
it also requires persu@@ ading representatives and policymakers to develop policies and allocate budget revenues to combat violence against women , and training police and judges to handle cases of violence against women without de@@ fer@@ ring to claims of family honor .
perhaps most importantly , non-@@ constitutional justice systems , such as sh@@ aria , must be monitored and checked , if not prohibited altogether .
as for sa@@ har gu@@ l , her case must be thoroughly investigated , and the police and judiciary must commit to bringing her tor@@ tur@@ ers to justice .
until afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s leaders begin to address this problem seriously , our country will continue to bear the sc@@ ar of violence against women on its face .
a field guide to isra@@ eli ha@@ w@@ ks
prime minister ar@@ iel shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s announcement that he plans to disman@@ tle je@@ wish settlements in the ga@@ za strip , as well as some settlements in the west bank , has sho@@ cked and caught people off guard both in isra@@ el and around the world .
many den@@ ounced shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s plan as a tri@@ ck .
but that surprise was wron@@ g-@@ headed from the start .
despite the way it often looks to out@@ si@@ ders , debates in isra@@ el about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to ha@@ w@@ ks and do@@ ves .
like everything in isra@@ el , the process is more complicated , especially where the ha@@ w@@ ks are concerned .
basically , there are two species of isra@@ eli ha@@ w@@ ks : call one kind ideological and the other strategic .
ideological ha@@ w@@ ks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical land of isra@@ el , the hom@@ eland of the je@@ wish people .
for them , the territories are part of the je@@ wish patri@@ mon@@ y , which is why they insist on referring to the west bank by its heb@@ re@@ w historical app@@ ell@@ ation - ju@@ de@@ a and sam@@ aria .
not all ideological ha@@ w@@ ks are religious , although those who are base their claim on di@@ vine promises and pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies .
but many ideological ha@@ w@@ ks are sec@@ ular nation@@ alists , and their jar@@ gon is similar to that of typical central and eastern europ@@ ean nation@@ alists .
former prime minister men@@ ach@@ em begin and y@@ itz@@ ha@@ k sham@@ ir belong@@ ed to that category .
ideological ha@@ w@@ ks usually come from the nation@@ al-@@ religious party and from members of the lik@@ ud .
they are inspired by the nation@@ alist ideology connected with v@@ ladimir j@@ abo@@ tin@@ sky , who founded &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; re@@ vision@@ ist &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; zion@@ ism as a challenge to the more moderate version esp@@ ous@@ ed by isra@@ el &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s founding fa@@ thers like ch@@ aim wei@@ z@@ mann and da@@ vi@@ d ben@@ -@@ g@@ uri@@ on .
then there are the strategic ha@@ w@@ ks .
for them , given isra@@ el &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing ar@@ ab en@@ m@@ ity , controlling the west bank and ga@@ za is not an ideological imperative , but is driven by security considerations .
for them , je@@ wish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands , but security out@@ posts , aimed at preventing - or rep@@ elling from a better strategic position - an attack on the isra@@ eli hear@@ t@@ land .
they may be right or wrong in this assessment , but it is not an ideological one .
ar@@ iel shar@@ on , who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social mi@@ lieu much near@@ er to labor than to j@@ abo@@ tin@@ sky &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ideas - is a strategic ha@@ w@@ k .
for ideological ha@@ w@@ ks , compromises are treas@@ on : how can you jeop@@ ardi@@ ze the historical patri@@ mon@@ y of the je@@ wish people , let alone go@@ d &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s promise to ab@@ ra@@ ham ?
strategic ha@@ w@@ ks , however , are open to practical bar@@ gains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes .
it is in this context that shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s moves should be seen .
he was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security .
he has brought neither .
with the defeat and dem@@ ise of sad@@ dam hus@@ sein , the danger of an &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; eastern front &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; against isra@@ el has dimin@@ ished .
ab@@ sent a pal@@ est@@ inian partner , and given continuing pal@@ est@@ inian terrorism - which isra@@ el &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s har@@ sh responses fail to qu@@ ell - what shar@@ on appears to be doing now follows from his strategi@@ c-@@ oriented thinking : set up an effective barrier , move some of the isolated and strategi@@ cally un@@ ten@@ able settlements , and wait for another day .
if one follows shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s statements in the last year , a clear pattern emerg@@ es .
first , he admitted that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; eventually &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a pal@@ est@@ inian state would emerge - something un@@ thin@@ k@@ able for dy@@ ed@@ -in-@@ the-@@ w@@ ool ideological ha@@ w@@ ks .
a few months later , he sc@@ and@@ alized his own lik@@ ud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and un@@ ten@@ able - another shock for those who always speak of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; liber@@ ated &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; rather than &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; occupied &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; territories .
last dec@@ ember , he explicitly stated that isra@@ el is headed towards unilateral dis@@ engagement , and that this would entail the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; re@@ location &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; of some settlements .
although this was still merely ver@@ bi@@ age , it was novel language for a lik@@ ud prime minister .
shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s latest statements , though , explicitly specified the settlements to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated ; the director of the national security council , general gi@@ ora ei@@ land , was appointed to chair an inter-@@ ministerial re@@ location committee and work out plans for conducting the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ations , including compensation for re@@ located sett@@ lers .
all of this has radi@@ cally alter@@ ed isra@@ el &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s domestic political map .
some ideological ha@@ w@@ ks in shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s government threatened to re@@ sign ; sh@@ im@@ on per@@ es announced that labor will offer shar@@ on a parliamentary safety net ; there is even talk about labor joining a national unity government .
the test , of course , is not in the planning , but in the implementation of withdrawal , and the road is long and b@@ ump@@ y .
shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption .
yet anyone who would like to pre@@ dict shar@@ on &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s future behavior should remember that unlike begin and sham@@ ir , shar@@ on comes from the military , and for him security - not ideology - is su@@ preme .
so his apparent pragmati@@ s@@ m should come as no surprise .
a foreign policy for new and old europ@@ e
watching the news from i@@ ra@@ q , i recall when i was pol@@ and &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s prime minister during the g@@ ulf war in 1991 .
i wat@@ ched from home on c@@ n@@ n as the first cru@@ ise missi@@ les hit bag@@ h@@ dad .
hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in i@@ ra@@ q . `@@ `@@ yes , i know , &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; i said . `@@ `@@ i &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ ve been watching the bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment on tv . &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;
twelve years later , pol@@ and &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s prime minister didn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t need a bel@@ ated call from his military to know that war was underway in i@@ ra@@ q .
all the details of the attack were provided in advance by the us , now pol@@ and &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s nat@@ o ally .
indeed , pol@@ and has secured a leading role in i@@ ra@@ q &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s occupation .
what a distance pol@@ and has trav@@ elled since commun@@ ism &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s collapse in 1989 !
little of this , however , is the result of design , for ( unfortunately ) we in pol@@ and have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of nat@@ o and put@@ ative member of the europ@@ ean union .
we remain narro@@ w@@ ly foc@@ uss@@ ed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us .
couple this with a form of foreign policy sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ eni@@ a-@@ -@@ some pol@@ es think that by `@@ `@@ simply existing &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; we influence europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s fate ; others suffer crip@@ pling p@@ essimis@@ m , con@@ signing pol@@ and to permanent `@@ `@@ second-@@ class &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; stat@@ us@@ --@@ and you have a recip@@ e for iner@@ tia .
our attitude seems to be that som@@ ehow things will sort themselves out .
much of europ@@ e seems to be stu@@ ck in the same min@@ d@@ set : we say that we want a common foreign and security policy , but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerg@@ es .
the time for such la@@ xity is over .
for pol@@ and and the other countries of e@@ ast-@@ central europ@@ e that have or are about to join nat@@ o , membership in the alliance didn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t really require debate .
our hist@@ ories of op@@ pression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within nat@@ o was the only real option .
eu membership and the global war on terror , however , demand a more deeply considered response .
why ?
because eu membership affects every aspect of a state , economy , and society , while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy .
today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s crisis in transatlantic relations , and our acci@@ dental involvement in it as part of don@@ ald ru@@ ms@@ feld &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s `@@ `@@ new europ@@ e , &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; means that pol@@ and ( like every other europ@@ ean state ) must now decide what it really wants from the eu and nat@@ o .
we must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to europ@@ ean interests , as well what it really means to be an eu partner .
only answers to these questions can re@@ conci@@ le the divide between the `@@ `@@ new &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; and `@@ `@@ old &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; europ@@ e , as well as the new and old at@@ lan@@ tic worlds .
pol@@ and as an ally of the us is not the real head@@ a@@ che facing president j@@ acqu@@ es chi@@ rac or chan@@ cell@@ or ger@@ hard sch@@ ro@@ eder .
they see new players ( say , sp@@ ain ) rising to shape eu policy , particularly foreign policy , and sense that their traditional leadership is being challeng@@ ed .
but an eu with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades .
so the challenge to fran@@ ce and ger@@ many does not arise because pol@@ and is some sort of ameri@@ can `@@ `@@ tro@@ jan horse . &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;
instead , the eu &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s structure now demands not only a new consensus about europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s role in the world , but also new means to achieve consensus . history cannot be put on hold as europ@@ e sorts out its internal balance of power .
the world needs a united continent , ready to go into action .
that consensus must include the us .
during the cold war , most europ@@ e@@ ans toler@@ ated ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s tendency to lead unilater@@ ally , because of the so@@ vi@@ et threat and the prep@@ onder@@ ance of us power .
but ameri@@ ca is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-@@ cold war era .
its difficulties are exacerb@@ ated by the dramatic dispar@@ ity in military forces on either side of the at@@ lan@@ tic , and its belief that europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because europ@@ e@@ ans won &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t spend the money necessary to achieve that goal .
here is where pol@@ and can help bridge the at@@ lan@@ tic divide and for@@ ge a europ@@ ean consensus .
se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 19@@ 39 taught every pole that military power must be real to be effective .
as dan@@ ish premi@@ er anders fo@@ gh ras@@ mus@@ sen recently said , `@@ `@@ fran@@ ce and ger@@ many are not in a position to guarantee our country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s security .
the us is , but security does not come free of charge . &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;
most pol@@ es think that pol@@ and &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s situation is ak@@ in to den@@ mark &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s .
indeed , all of europ@@ e is in thr@@ all to ameri@@ can power .
but this dependence should not dis@@ gu@@ ise the fact that there is a comm@@ on@@ ality of foreign policy interests between europ@@ e and ameri@@ ca .
if the eu builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth , many of today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s divisions will disappear .
the eu &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s foreign policy should be guided by the following goals :
prevent local conflict ;
promote human rights and democracy ;
maintain close cooperation between europ@@ e and the us ;
help poor countries .
pol@@ ish foreign policy , like that of the eu , can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic step@@ s@@ --@@ and sp@@ ends the necessary mon@@ e@@ y-@@ -@@ to realize these objectives .
they are the only possible bed@@ rock in transatlantic relations , in an expanded union , and in relations between the `@@ `@@ new &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; and `@@ `@@ old &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; europ@@ e .
a fra@@ cking good story
pra@@ gue – weather conditions around the world this summer have provided ample fo@@ d@@ der for the global warming debate .
d@@ rou@@ ghts and heat waves are a har@@ b@@ inger of our future , carbon cuts are needed now more than ever , and yet meaningful policies have not been en@@ acted .
but , beyond this well-@@ tro@@ dden batt@@ le@@ field , something amazing has happened : car@@ b@@ on-@@ dioxide emissions in the united states have dropped to their lowest level in 20 years .
estim@@ ating on the basis of data from the us energy information agency ( ei@@ a ) from the first five months of 2012 , this year ’ s expected co@@ 2 emissions have declined by more than 800 million tons , or 14 % , from their peak in 2007 .
the cause is an unprecedented switch to natural gas , which em@@ its 45 % less carbon per energy unit .
the us used to generate about half its electricity from coal , and roughly 20 % from gas .
over the past five years , those numbers have changed , first slowly and now dramatically : in ap@@ ri@@ l of this year , coal ’ s share in power generation pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed to just 32 % , on par with gas .
ameri@@ ca ’ s rapid switch to natural gas is the result of three decades of technological innovation , particularly the development of hydrau@@ lic fra@@ c@@ turing , or “ fra@@ cking , ” which has opened up large new resources of previously in@@ accessible sh@@ ale gas .
despite some legitimate concerns about safety , it is hard to over@@ state the overwhelming benefits .
for star@@ ters , fra@@ cking has caused gas prices to drop dramatically .
adjusted for inflation , gas has not been this cheap for the past 35 years , with the price this year 3-@@ 5 times lower than it was in the mid-@@ 2000 ’ s .
and , while a flag@@ ging economy may explain a small portion of the drop in us carbon emissions , the ei@@ a empha@@ sizes that the major explanation is natural gas .
the reduction is even more impressive when one considers that 57 million additional energy consumers were added to the us population over the past two decades .
indeed , us carbon emissions have dropped some 20 % per capita , and are now at their lowest level since d@@ wi@@ ght d. eis@@ en@@ ho@@ wer left the white house in 196@@ 1 .
da@@ vi@@ d vic@@ tor , an energy expert at the university of c@@ alifor@@ nia , s@@ an di@@ ego , estimates that the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced us emissions by 400@@ -@@ 500 me@@ g@@ at@@ onn@@ es ( mt ) of co@@ 2 per year .
to put that number in perspective , it is about twice the total effect of the k@@ yo@@ to protocol on carbon emissions in the rest of the world , including the europ@@ ean union .
it is temp@@ ting to believe that renewable energy sources are responsible for emissions reductions , but the numbers clearly say otherwise .
accounting for a reduction of 50 mt of co@@ 2 per year , ameri@@ ca ’ s 30@@ ,000 wind tur@@ bin@@ es reduce emissions by just one-@@ tent@@ h the amount that natural gas does .
biofuels reduce emissions by only ten mt , and solar panels by a pal@@ try three mt .
this f@@ lies in the face of conventional thinking , which continues to claim that mand@@ ating carbon reductions – through cap@@ -@@ and-@@ trade or a carbon tax – is the only way to combat climate change .
but , based on europ@@ e ’ s experience , such policies are precisely the wrong way to address global warming .
since 1990 , the eu has heavily subsidi@@ zed solar and wind energy at a cost of more than $ 20 billion annually .
yet its per capita co@@ 2 emissions have fallen by less than half of the reduction achieved in the us – even in percentage terms , the us is now doing better .
because of broad europ@@ ean skep@@ tic@@ ism about fra@@ cking , there is no gas mi@@ racle in the eu , while the abund@@ ance of heavily subsidi@@ zed renew@@ ables has caused over-@@ achievement of the co@@ 2 target .
along with the closure of german nuclear power stations , this has led , ir@@ on@@ ically , to a res@@ ur@@ gence of coal .
well-@@ meaning us politicians have likewise shown how not to tackle global warming with subsidies and tax breaks .
the relatively small reduction in emissions achieved through wind power costs more than $ 3.@@ 3 billion annually , and far smaller reductions from ethan@@ ol ( biofuels ) and solar panels cost at least $ 8.@@ 5 and $ 3 billion annually .
estimates suggest that using carbon taxes to achieve a further 3@@ 30 mt co@@ 2 reduction in the eu would cost $ 250 billion per year . mean@@ while , the fra@@ cking bon@@ an@@ za in the us not only delivers a much greater reduction for free , but also creates long-term social benefits through lower energy costs .
the amazing truth is that fra@@ cking has succeeded where k@@ yo@@ to and carbon taxes have failed .
as shown in a study by the break@@ through institute , fra@@ cking was built on substantial government investment in technological innovation for three decades .
climate economists repeatedly have pointed out that such energy innovation is the most effective climate solution , because it is the su@@ rest way to drive the price of future green energy sources below that of fossil fuels .
by contrast , subsidi@@ zing current , in@@ effective solar power or ethan@@ ol mostly wa@@ stes money while benefiting special interests .
fra@@ cking is not a pan@@ ac@@ ea , but it really is by far this decade ’ s best gre@@ en-@@ energy option .
a free lunch for ameri@@ ca
but , on the other side of the at@@ lan@@ tic , ameri@@ cans have no reason to feel s@@ mu@@ g .
summ@@ ers could have used the same met@@ aph@@ or to cri@@ tici@@ ze the united states , where the continued focus on the long-@@ run funding di@@ le@@ mm@@ as of social insurance is su@@ cking all of the ox@@ y@@ gen out of efforts to deal with ameri@@ ca ’ s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis .
the us government can currently bor@@ row for 30 years at a real ( infl@@ ation-@@ adjusted ) interest rate of 1 % per year .
sup@@ pose that the us government were to bor@@ row an extra $ 500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even un@@ produc@@ tively , on projects for which the social rate of return is a meas@@ ly 25 % per year .
sup@@ pose that – as seems to be the case – the simple ke@@ yn@@ esian govern@@ ment-@@ expenditure multip@@ lier on this spending is only two .
in that case , the $ 500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $ 1 tril@@ lion of extra output of goods and services , generate approximately seven million person@@ -@@ years of extra employment , and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years .
and , with ti@@ ghter lab@@ or-@@ force atta@@ chment on the part of those who have jobs , the unemployment rate there@@ after would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the in@@ definite future .
the impressive gains don ’ t stop there .
better infrastructure would mean an extra $ 20 billion a year of income and social welfare .
a lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $ 20 billion a year in higher production .
and half of the extra $ 1 tril@@ lion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for ameri@@ can households .
in sum , on the benefits side of the equ@@ ation : more jobs now , $ 500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years , and then a $ 40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year there@@ after .
so , what are the likely costs of an extra $ 500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years ?
for star@@ ters , the $ 500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $ 300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity .
so the net result would be a $ 200 billion increase in the national debt .
ameri@@ can taxpayers would then have to pay $ 2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years , and then pay off or roll over the entire $ 200 billion .
the $ 40 billion a year of higher economic activity would , however , generate roughly $ 10 billion a year in additional tax revenue .
using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due , the tax@@ -@@ financed reserves generated by the health@@ ier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt .
in other words , taxpayers win , because the benefits from the health@@ ier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servi@@ cing the higher national debt , enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates .
households win , too , because they get to buy more and nic@@ er things with their incomes .
companies win , because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure .
the unemployed win , because some of them get jobs .
and even bond investors win , because they get their money back , with the interest for which they contrac@@ ted .
so what is not to like ?
nothing .
how , you might ask , can i say this ?
i am an econom@@ ist – a professor of the dis@@ mal science , in which there are no free lun@@ ches , in which benefits are always balanced by costs , and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are .
but there are two things different about today .
first , the us labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole .
second , bond investors are being really st@@ up@@ id .
in a world in which the s &@@ amp@@ ; p 500 has a 7 % annual earnings yield , nobody should be happy holding a us government 30-@@ year infl@@ ation-@@ adjusted bond that yiel@@ ds 1 % per year .
that six-@@ percent@@ age-@@ point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors ’ extraordinary and ir@@ rational pan@@ ic .
they are willing to pay 6 % per year for “ safety . ”
right now , however , the us government can manufacture “ safety ” out of thin air merely by printing bonds .
the government , too , would then win by po@@ ck@@ eting that 6 % per year of value – though 30 years from now , bon@@ d@@ holders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their port@@ folios ’ extra@@ ordin@@ arily poor performance of over 201@@ 1-@@ 20@@ 41 and rue their strategy .
a f@@ ren@@ ch cure for the resource cur@@ se
new y@@ or@@ k – the campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extrac@@ tive activities disc@@ lose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum – and fran@@ ce is leading the effort .
president ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy should be applau@@ ded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um , gas , and mining companies listed on europ@@ ean stock exchanges .
fran@@ ce , at the heart of the europ@@ ean union and president of both the g-@@ 8 and g-@@ 20 this year , is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move .
with f@@ ren@@ ch leadership , 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear , precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extrac@@ tiv@@ e-@@ industry companies to governmental authorities .
oil , gas , and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies .
moreover , these industries often play a central role in the economic development of re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ rich countries .
yet , despite great natural wealth , a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty .
the actual taxes and payments made by mining , oil , and other extrac@@ tiv@@ e-@@ industry companies to governments are usually a well-@@ kept secret , even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good .
in reality , in far too many countries , ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money ; in fact , they must bear the brun@@ t of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and dri@@ ll@@ ing operations .
indeed , these well-@@ kept industry and government secre@@ ts can have serious and widespread repercussions .
witness the up@@ heav@@ al in north afri@@ ca and the middle east .
in these countries , many of which are rich in oil and gas , citizens are st@@ aging protests against corruption and political repression .
at bottom , they are pro@@ testing against the mis@@ management of their countries ’ wealth and resources – with implications that affect the security and afford@@ ability of the entire world ’ s energy supplies .
transparency is an essential part of the solution . citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms , as well as mining companies , publish all of their relevant financial information , broken down by country and by project , and including all payments made to ho@@ st-@@ country public budgets .
if europ@@ ean regulators can agree on this requirement for all extrac@@ tiv@@ e-@@ industry companies listed on their stock exchanges , this transparency nor@@ m will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located .
regulators must also stipul@@ ate that company reports be made available on a regular , timely basis , and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extrac@@ tive companies .
the united states has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments , through the 2010 do@@ d@@ d-@@ fran@@ k law .
that law ’ s requirement that companies fully disc@@ lose their revenue stre@@ ams by country and by project applies to 90 % of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies .
this will help citizens track how that money is used , but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share .
if the eu were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers , financial and accounting balances , and payments to authorities , companies would become truly accountable to citizens , and government revenues would be aug@@ mented .
such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the europ@@ ean commission , and f@@ ren@@ ch support is imperative if the eu is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency .
f@@ ren@@ ch finance minister christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de recently highlighted the necessity of promoting “ initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance , integrity , and transparency in economic transactions . ”
at its ju@@ st-@@ completed summit in de@@ au@@ ville , fran@@ ce , the g-@@ 8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil , gas , and mining companies . this is an important advance , but , unfortunately , it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative , and it focuses only on payments transparency .
now the world must look to the g-@@ 20 summit in c@@ annes this nov@@ ember to make an un@@ equi@@ vocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed , given that important emerging economies such as bra@@ zi@@ l , indi@@ a , and ch@@ ina , as well as south afri@@ ca and other re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ rich afri@@ can countries , will be at the table .
the importance of financial transparency in the extrac@@ tive industries is not limited to one country or era – and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone .
greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives , economies , and political systems around the world .
a f@@ ren@@ ch presidential pri@@ mer
the late bri@@ tish prime minister har@@ old wil@@ son used to qui@@ p that “ a week is a long time in politics . ”
so , in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next f@@ ren@@ ch presidential election , any pre@@ diction made today could be revers@@ ed , and revers@@ ed again , before the vote .
but two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favor@@ ites in opinion p@@ olls : ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy on the right and sé@@ gol@@ è@@ ne ro@@ yal on the left .
in fact , they have more in common than meets the eye , for each speaks of a rup@@ ture with the past while inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ating a form of continuity .
for s@@ arko@@ zy , “ rup@@ ture ” reflects both m@@ und@@ an@@ ely tac@@ tical and deeply personal choices .
the 12 years of j@@ acqu@@ es chi@@ rac ‘ s presidency , together with fran@@ ce ’ s tradition of altern@@ ation in power , suggests a victory for the left .
posi@@ tioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today ’ s un@@ popular politics is the only means to escape that fate .
this is reflected in s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s openly pro-@@ ameri@@ can stance – an act of political courage in a fran@@ ce where anti-@@ ameri@@ can@@ ism is running high .
s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s message is that chi@@ rac and vil@@ le@@ pin were right in substance to oppose ameri@@ ca ’ s military adventure in i@@ ra@@ q , but that their style was disastro@@ us@@ ly wrong .
thus , his deep ad@@ mir@@ ation for “ ameri@@ can values , ” while sincere , implies no embra@@ ce of president ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush .
it also reas@@ sures the f@@ ren@@ ch business community , which was sho@@ cked by dom@@ ini@@ que de vil@@ le@@ pin ’ s fl@@ am@@ boy@@ ant opposition to the united states when he was chi@@ rac ’ s foreign minister .
at home , s@@ arko@@ zy has aimed his message particularly at the young , issuing a patri@@ o@@ tic call to the values of work and discipline , a counter-@@ revolutionary revolution .
the revolution that must be overcome is that of may 1968 , whose leaders and supporters , according to s@@ arko@@ zy , may have lost politically to de gau@@ lle , but deeply weak@@ ened fran@@ ce over the succ@@ ee@@ ding decades with their emphasis on “ false values . ”
by contrast , reb@@ elling against one ’ s parents ’ generation and re@@ dis@@ covering traditional moral stances will save fran@@ ce – a message that is highly applicable to issues , such as education and immigration , that may domin@@ ate the electoral campaign .
in the case of ro@@ yal , the meaning of “ rup@@ ture ” is both more obvious and more visible .
she is seeking to become the first woman president of the f@@ ren@@ ch re@@ public .
to achieve her goal , she pre@@ fers to emphasize her “ essence , ” thereby counter@@ ing s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s stress on his record as a “ do@@ er . ”
her appeal to voters is simple : “ i am a woman , and you have never tried a woman , so be modern and try one now . ”
hi@@ ding behind the origin@@ ality ( in f@@ ren@@ ch presidential politics ) of her gender , ro@@ yal has avoided speci@@ fying a detailed program .
when challeng@@ ed by in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda , her highly effective line of defense ( so far ! ) has been : “ you would not d@@ are to ask me such a question if i were not a woman ! ”
thus , ro@@ yal ’ s program is her popularity .
in foreign policy , one can only gu@@ ess what her priorities would be .
as far as europ@@ e is concerned , she seems as “ agno@@ stic ” as s@@ arko@@ zy , who , like her , inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ates a new generation of “ post-@@ europ@@ ean ” leaders .
in terms of values , ro@@ yal , too , seems to represent a rup@@ ture with may 1968 , with her emphasis on discipline and family .
according to public opinion p@@ olls , ro@@ yal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat s@@ arko@@ zy .
her support is particularly strong among women voters .
for the socialist party , which is e@@ ager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the hum@@ ili@@ ating defeat of li@@ on@@ el jo@@ sp@@ in in the first round of the presidential election in 2002 , the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favor@@ able public opinion behind ro@@ yal .
in the opinion of ro@@ yal ’ s many opponents among socialist leaders and milit@@ ants , the domin@@ ance of the media in the political process is leading to medi@@ oc@@ r@@ ity : the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to go@@ vern .
according to ro@@ yal ’ s socialist critics , the “ hol@@ ly@@ woo@@ di@@ zation ” of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and fol@@ lo@@ wers lead .
but the same criticism can be directed at s@@ arko@@ zy .
moreover , both candidates em@@ body continuity – with chi@@ rac ’ s gau@@ ll@@ ist side for s@@ arko@@ zy and with fran@@ ç@@ ois mit@@ ter@@ r@@ and for ro@@ yal – as much as rup@@ ture .
ro@@ yal openly claims mit@@ ter@@ and ’ s legacy as she sear@@ ches for legitimacy , while s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s rejection of chi@@ rac ’ s legacy has more to do with form than substance .
to a large extent , s@@ arko@@ zy can be seen as chi@@ rac with more , whereas ro@@ yal is clearly mit@@ ter@@ r@@ and with less .
when the voters decide in the spring of 2007 , their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations , as it did in 2002 , when chi@@ rac faced the o@@ di@@ ous nation@@ alist je@@ an-@@ mar@@ ie le pen in the second round .
as in 2002 , the winner next year will be wh@@ om@@ ever the elec@@ torate dis@@ li@@ kes or fears less .
but one way or the other , person@@ alities will prevail over programs .
a fresh start for ch@@ ina and jap@@ an ?
ed@@ mon@@ ton – chin@@ ese president h@@ u j@@ inta@@ o will make a high-@@ profile visit to jap@@ an from may 6-@@ 10 , making him the second chin@@ ese head of state ever to travel there .
the trip is being carefully managed by both countries , and is being wat@@ ched closely around the world , with good reason : sin@@ o-@@ jap@@ anese relations over the past decade have been tur@@ bul@@ ent , to say the least .
when h@@ u ’ s predec@@ essor , ji@@ ang z@@ em@@ in , travel@@ ed to jap@@ an ten years ago , bilateral relations were deterior@@ ating : ch@@ ina was un@@ happy with the jap@@ anese government ’ s refusal to extend the same ap@@ ology offered to south korea for past aggres@@ sion ; jap@@ an was worried about a rising ch@@ ina and thus turning more confron@@ t@@ ational .
the jap@@ anese media ’ s coverage of the visit was overwhel@@ m@@ ingly negative , and it was remember@@ ed as a public-@@ relations disaster .
h@@ u succeeded ji@@ ang in 2002 , almost as former prime minister j@@ uni@@ ch@@ ir@@ o ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi was coming to power in jap@@ an , and encouraged “ new thinking ” in ch@@ ina ’ s jap@@ an policy , which would entail moving away from historical grie@@ v@@ ances and promoting better ties .
but , instead of accepting ch@@ ina ’ s olive branch , ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi implemented a more nation@@ alistic agenda , including annual visits to the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i shine , which is regarded as a symbol of jap@@ anese militar@@ ism by jap@@ an ’ s neigh@@ b@@ ors .
his har@@ d-@@ line approach isolated jap@@ an and an@@ gered ch@@ ina , leading to an out@@ bur@@ st of anti-@@ jap@@ anese demonstrations in ch@@ ina in 2005 .
but both jap@@ an and ch@@ ina recognize that further tension will serve neither country ’ s long-term interests .
ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi ’ s success@@ ors , prime ministers sh@@ in@@ zo abe and y@@ as@@ u@@ o fu@@ ku@@ da , have sought to engage ch@@ ina over the past two years , with summ@@ its in bei@@ jing and a successful visit by chin@@ ese premi@@ er wen ji@@ ab@@ ao to jap@@ an last year .
h@@ u ’ s trip is likely follow the example set by wen .
he will emphasize common strategic interests , highlight mutual economic benefits , generate positive public opinion , and promote further exchanges .
jap@@ an is not only one of ch@@ ina ’ s largest trade and investment partners , it is also the most powerful neigh@@ bor with which ch@@ ina wants to be on good terms , partly to show@@ case that ch@@ ina ’ s rise is not a threat to a@@ sia and the rest of the world .
jap@@ an , whose economic recovery is attri@@ but@@ able largely to its deepening ties with ch@@ ina in recent years , is also e@@ ager to demonstrate that it regards ch@@ ina not as a threat but as an opportunity , as least in economic terms .
it was 30 years ago that former prime minister take@@ o fu@@ ku@@ da , the father of today ’ s prime minister , signed a peace and friend@@ ship treaty with ch@@ ina .
the two governments will certainly use h@@ u ’ s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friend@@ ship .
but , unlike three decades ago , when the jap@@ anese regarded ch@@ ina as one of their most favo@@ red countries , public opinion in both countries nowadays reg@@ isters more negative feelings than positive ones .
behind the sm@@ iles , the pol@@ ite inter@@ actions , and the cau@@ ti@@ ously wor@@ ded diplomatic language , strong under@@ curr@@ ents of suspici@@ on remain .
one problem is the disp@@ uted waters of the east ch@@ ina sea .
despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection , areas in which ch@@ ina ranks jap@@ an as the best perform@@ er among industri@@ alized countries , the two sides remain in bit@@ ter@@ ly divided over these territorial waters , which contain huge potential oil , gas , and other mineral deposits .
even after many ro@@ unds of talks , no resolution is in sight , and h@@ u ’ s visit is not expected to produce any break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
then there are strategic suspici@@ ons .
fu@@ ku@@ da has dropped abe ’ s talk about an “ arch of freedom ” – an effort to for@@ ge a blo@@ c with the united states , au@@ str@@ alia , and indi@@ a .
but jap@@ an remains concerned about ch@@ ina ’ s rapidly moderni@@ zing military , while ch@@ ina wor@@ ries about a potential us-@@ jap@@ an con@@ tainment strategy for ch@@ ina , especially in the case of a crisis in the ta@@ i@@ wan stra@@ its .
so , although both sides endorse the idea of a “ mutually beneficial strategic relationship , ” and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges , mutual trust and confi@@ den@@ ce-@@ building have a long way to go .
moreover , today ’ s “ warm politics , cool economics ” trend is the reverse of the “ cold politics , warm economics ” pattern under ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi .
last year , jap@@ an ’ s committed investment projects in ch@@ ina fell 24 % from 2006 , while actual investment volume decreased by 25 % , partly owing to regulatory changes in ch@@ ina regarding foreign investment .
recent food safety issues , such as the “ po@@ is@@ oned du@@ m@@ pl@@ ings ” cases , have clearly hei@@ gh@@ tened the jap@@ anese public ’ s sensitivity about chin@@ ese exports .
while fu@@ ku@@ da has made it clear that he will not visit the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i shr@@ ine , 160 other parlia@@ mentari@@ ans paid hom@@ age at the site last month , an indication that conservative forces in jap@@ an remain strong and that future prime ministers may not ab@@ stain from visiting y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i .
and jap@@ an has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 7@@ 00@@ ,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in ch@@ ina by the jap@@ anese army at the end of world war ii , another potential flash point if any of these weapons causes cas@@ u@@ alties in ch@@ ina .
a fresh start for europ@@ e in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca ?
mil@@ an – by 2050 , bra@@ zi@@ l and m@@ ex@@ ico will be among the world ’ s six leading economies , according to an@@ al@@ yst@@ s at the investment bank gol@@ d@@ man sach@@ s .
does the europ@@ ean union care ?
is l@@ atin ameri@@ ca to be europ@@ e ’ s next missed business opportunity ?
l@@ atin ameri@@ ca has a population of 5@@ 50 million , with average yearly per capita income of $ 4@@ ,000 , immense natural resources , and substantial human capital .
it accounts for 8 % of world production and grew by more than 5 % in each of the past three years .
although the united states remains the main destination of l@@ atin ameri@@ can and c@@ arib@@ bean exports , a@@ sia is becoming an increasingly important market for goods based on natural resources .
during the past four years , l@@ atin ameri@@ ca attracted an annual average of $ 61 billion in foreign direct investment , 60 % of which went to bra@@ zi@@ l and m@@ ex@@ ico .
in the 1990 ’ s , foreign investors were ch@@ ie@@ fly attracted by privati@@ zation programs in the region , but more recently mergers and acqu@@ isi@@ tions and gre@@ en@@ field projects have been the most common type of investment .
pre@@ dict@@ ably , sp@@ ain is the most important europ@@ ean investor in the region , though several important span@@ ish operations have recently passed to itali@@ an companies , among them the utility en@@ des@@ a , acquired by en@@ el , which is now the biggest private energy distribut@@ or in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca .
mean@@ while , l@@ atin ameri@@ can businesses have been increasing their own foreign investments .
in 2006 , bra@@ zi@@ l invested $ 28.@@ 2 billion abroad , compared to in@@ flows of $ 18.@@ 8 billion .
indeed , emerging gi@@ ants from l@@ atin ameri@@ ca and a@@ sia will be at the center of worldwide investment in the coming decades .
in 2006 , ital@@ y ’ s fi@@ at group and indi@@ a ’ s t@@ ata mo@@ tors established a joint venture to make passenger vehicles and engines in indi@@ a .
the following year , they extended their partnership to l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , investing $ 80 million in production of a t@@ ata pi@@ ck@@ -up tru@@ ck at fi@@ at ’ s factory in cor@@ do@@ ba , ar@@ gent@@ ina .
it is to be hoped that many more major europ@@ ean corporations will follow suit .
but small and medium sized enterprises ( sm@@ es ) – the majority of firms in both l@@ atin ameri@@ ca and europ@@ e – find it difficult to trade and invest at international level , in part because of high transaction and information costs .
in europ@@ e , clu@@ sters of sm@@ es appear able to achieve economies of scale and scope , and thus to succeed collecti@@ vely in global markets .
this europ@@ ean experience is now being widely studied in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca .
in bra@@ zi@@ l , four local production systems have combined to form project promo@@ s / se@@ bra@@ e / bid , based on the example of ital@@ y ’ s industrial districts .
between 2002 and 2006 , bra@@ zi@@ l ’ s s@@ me support services and the mil@@ an chamber of commerce created partnerships involving furniture , shoes , designer ling@@ erie , and han@@ dic@@ ra@@ fts from different regions of the country .
this approach may well be the shape of things to come .
but , while the eu ’ s association agreement with m@@ ex@@ ico is 10 years old , it does not yet have a strategic partnership with bra@@ zi@@ l .
this is partly because of the ne@@ ver-@@ ending negotiation process with mer@@ co@@ sur , the troub@@ led – and still incomplete – l@@ atin ameri@@ can customs union .
the eu is currently negotiating trade liberalization deals with all of l@@ atin ameri@@ ca ’ s regional b@@ loc@@ s : mer@@ co@@ sur , the c@@ arib@@ bean community , the central ameri@@ ca common market , and the an@@ de@@ an community .
the eu must urge its l@@ atin ameri@@ can partners towards further integration .
adopting a common “ rule of origin ” for their products would be an incentive to liber@@ alize their international trade further , thus increasing it .
full trade liberalization in l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , although difficult to achieve , must be made central to eu strategy , and would boost economic growth .
but even if tariffs and quotas are progres@@ sively reduced , trade flows may remain low if other trade costs remain high .
eu cooperation thus should be directed to lower@@ ing trade costs .
the crucial issue is market access .
most l@@ atin ameri@@ can countries still get poor results from their efforts to export to europ@@ e , the exceptions being raw materials and energy resources .
after the establishment of the eu@@ -@@ ch@@ ile free-@@ trade area , chi@@ lean exports to the eu increased substantially .
but in the case of eu@@ -@@ m@@ ex@@ ico trade liberalization , the growth of imports from the eu has exceeded the growth of exports to europ@@ e , resulting in a wi@@ dening m@@ exi@@ can trade deficit with the eu .
this is at od@@ ds with the eu ’ s proc@@ lam@@ ations since the 1999 ri@@ o summit that l@@ atin ameri@@ ca is a vital political and economic partner .
a change in europ@@ e ’ s approach is needed if a strategic partnership is to be created .
the europ@@ ean commission under@@ stands this .
although the eu does not have a strategic partnership with bra@@ zi@@ l , it intends to push ahead with one as fast as possible .
in mid-@@ 2007 , the commission confirmed that it will re@@ visit the eu ’ s dialogue with mer@@ co@@ sur , with the aim of giving new impetus to negotiations .
but there is also keen awareness that the eu ’ s hope for a special relationship with bra@@ zi@@ l must not be allowed to hin@@ der regional integration or wor@@ sen asymmet@@ ries and imbalances within the blo@@ c .
if l@@ atin ameri@@ ca is to become a strategic partner for the eu and a more attractive market for europ@@ ean companies , europ@@ ean institutions must become more open to the region ’ s needs .
a fresh start by the eu with bra@@ zi@@ l and m@@ ex@@ ico could prove promising , because of the “ pull ” it might have on other countries .
but this must be accompanied by measures to keep all l@@ atin ameri@@ can countries on board .
otherwise , l@@ atin ameri@@ ca may well prove to be europ@@ e ’ s next missed business opportunity .
as europ@@ e ’ s leaders gather in portu@@ gal to put the finishing tou@@ ches on the new , sli@@ mm@@ ed down , reform treaty , it might be helpful if they all pre@@ ten@@ ded that the last 50 years of europ@@ ean integration had never taken place .
let ’ s then imagine what europ@@ e needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges , especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of 50 years of eu de@@ al-@@ making and ra@@ m@@ sh@@ ackle institution@@ -@@ building .
on top of that , let us make a major lea@@ p of imagination and sup@@ pose that even though this scenario of the eu at “ year zero ” means we would not have a half-@@ century of in@@ tra-@@ europ@@ ean cooperation to draw on , the nations that today make up the eu would nevertheless be keen to adopt far-reaching joint policies .
let ’ s suspend our dis@@ belief , then , and try to imagine what europ@@ e could and should be doing to tackle some of the most far-reaching and ob@@ stin@@ ate policy challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years are as constructive as the last .
or , to put it another way , let ’ s look at our problems in the light of the eu ’ s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies , and then let ’ s ask ourselves why the eu isn ’ t re@@ alizing its own potential and delivering the goods .
broadly , we see three areas in which europ@@ e ’ s policymakers at both the national and eu levels can do better : global challenges where europ@@ e could show greater leadership , the creation and strengthening of human capital within the eu and worldwide , and improvement in the effectiveness of the eu ’ s own political machinery .
europ@@ e needs a clearer and more recogni@@ z@@ able global agenda .
it needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tou@@ gher eu goals , and then use its international economic and trade cl@@ out to champi@@ on new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful .
on conflict and security issues , europ@@ e should be adv@@ ancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and un@@ ambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against bur@@ ma ’ s military regime .
the purpose must be to establish europ@@ e as a for@@ ce@@ ful and fair@@ -@@ minded player on the world stage , rather than as a “ broad church ” in which different view@@ points co-@@ exist .
the aim should be that “ soft power ” instruments like eu development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security ou@@ tre@@ ach to ensure europ@@ e is a global player to be reck@@ oned with .
that means , of course , that the eu should seek to wi@@ den its transatlantic thinking so that the eu and the united states cooperate more closely on defining – and thus protecting – their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than 10 % of the total population .
these points are far from a blan@@ ket criticism of the eu ’ s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy .
but they are intended to underline what many people in europ@@ e know very well , which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily out@@ pac@@ es the eu ’ s policy responses so far .
building more human capital in europ@@ e and worldwide is a cru@@ cially important element in future eu activities .
education is by far the most profitable investment europ@@ e can make , so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the eu while helping to expand greatly education in the world ’ s poorest countries .
europ@@ e also must at last gras@@ p the n@@ ett@@ le of immigration policy – something that has persist@@ ently el@@ u@@ ded generations of political leaders .
agreed eu@@ -@@ wide immigration rules are needed to re@@ conci@@ le shr@@ in@@ king europ@@ e ’ s hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social un@@ rest .
it won ’ t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-@@ cultural europ@@ e , but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even hea@@ vier price .
by much the same to@@ ken , europ@@ e ’ s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen europ@@ e@@ ans ’ sense of a shared history and common values .
a stronger europ@@ ean identity is the sound@@ est basis for creating the more multi-@@ cultural society that demo@@ graph@@ ers regard as inevitable .
mean@@ while , doubts still surro@@ und the political and institutional machinery the eu will need to realize these and other ambitious goals .
si@@ gh@@ s of relief gre@@ eted eu leaders ’ mid-@@ year agreement on a reform treaty aimed at over@@ hau@@ ling the union ’ s decision-making mechanisms , but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries .
we believe , though , that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embo@@ died in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself .
that way , if a small minority of eu governments prove unable to ratify the treaty , it would not be tor@@ pe@@ do@@ ed the way that its predec@@ essor , the constitutional treaty , was in 2005 .
how to help the afri@@ can dust bow@@ l
se@@ at@@ tle – picture a small farm under a bla@@ zing hot sky .
this scenario describes today ’ s southern afri@@ ca , which is in the gri@@ ps of an ep@@ ic d@@ rought .
as it happens , it also describes eastern ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka in the “ dust bow@@ l ” years of the early 19@@ 30@@ s – a period through which my own family lived .
my father , r@@ alp@@ h ra@@ i@@ kes , was the first in his family to gradu@@ ate from college .
after working for standard oil in c@@ alifor@@ nia , he stopped by his parents ’ farm on his way to cam@@ bridge , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , where he planned to pursue gradu@@ ate studies at mit .
he never made it .
he had to stay in ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka and help my grand@@ father save the family farm from the banks , which had already re@@ poss@@ essed one-@@ third of the land .
the most important change my father made was in his min@@ d@@ set : he came to think of the farm not as a sub@@ sist@@ ence operation , but as a family business .
he turned to the university of ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka , where he had received his under@@ gradu@@ ate degree , and acquired hybri@@ d cor@@ n and other improved seeds that the university was developing .
then he tra@@ cked in@@ puts and weather conditions , which was rarely done at that time .
my father realized that he couldn ’ t go it alone , and that he would need better access to financing .
so he helped guide – first as a customer , and later as an advis@@ er and director – farm credit , a national banking cooperative network , in its efforts to help local farmers weather the dust bow@@ l years .
he also helped found the ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka farm business association , which aggreg@@ ated the data that he and his pe@@ ers collected , so that they could determine best practices .
and he worked together with my mother , ali@@ ce , who ran the family poultry business .
farm credit and the university of ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka ’ s lab@@ s and greenh@@ ouses emerged out of united states government programs that had been created to improve the agriculture sector ’ s performance .
that sector was under water in 19@@ 33 ; with one-@@ quarter of the population living on farms at the time , more investment was needed .
that year , congress passed the first “ farm bill , ” the agricultural adjustment act , which boo@@ sted investment in the rural economy and helped lift farm income by 50 % within two years .
federal farm programs treated farming as a business enterprise , enabling business@@ men like my father to prosp@@ er .
eigh@@ ty years later , afri@@ can farmers need to make the same switch , by treating their sub@@ sist@@ ence operations as family-@@ owned enterprises .
and , like my father during the dust bow@@ l years , they have novel means at their disposal : a wide range of new seeds and other technologies have been developed for afri@@ can family farms – those with 4-@@ 5 acres or less – to use in the field .
in oc@@ tober , a group of scientists received the world food prize for producing and dissemin@@ ating a sweet pot@@ ato variety that adds vit@@ amin a to sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ cans ’ di@@ ets , and other new seed varieties are helping farmers survive the har@@ vest@@ -@@ cr@@ ush@@ ing d@@ rought .
but , as a recent report from the alliance for a green revolution in afri@@ ca ( ag@@ ra ) makes clear , government investment must follow the science .
agriculture comprises almost two-@@ thirds of sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca ’ s workforce , and in 2003 the afri@@ can union called for countries to increase their investment in the sector to an ambitious 10 % of all government spending .
only 13 countries answered that call , but their investments – in research and development , services that help farmers take advantage of new research findings , credit and financing initiatives , commodity exchanges , and other marketing efforts – have already paid divi@@ den@@ ds .
those 13 countries have experienced marked improvements in agricultural production , per capita g@@ d@@ p , and nutrition .
government investment pa@@ ves the way for priv@@ ate-@@ sector investment , and it could be a gam@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger for afri@@ can farmers , who have operated at sub@@ sist@@ ence levels for far too long .
only about 6 % of rural households in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca receive loans from financial institutions .
moreover , almost two-@@ thirds of afri@@ can farm@@ land soil is missing key nutri@@ ents , and many farmers lack the technical knowledge and resources to restore their land ’ s fertil@@ ity , leaving them unable to take full advantage of new technologies .
afri@@ can farmers growing new crop varieties are increasing their yiel@@ ds by only 28 % , compared to 88 % for farmers in a@@ sia .
my parents made certain that all five of their children gradu@@ ated from college .
like them , farmers everywhere want to ensure that their children lead healthy , prosperous lives ; and they all recognize the importance of education .
the farmers i have met around the world often just want to sell enough extra produce to pay their health bil@@ ls and put their children through school .
they take advantage of opportunities when they arise , and they position their children to re@@ ap larger profits in the future .
one hopes that an ameri@@ can story of economic progress , like that of my family , will soon be an afri@@ can story , too .
with so many new innovations becoming available , afri@@ ca ’ s family farmers need their governments to invest in their future .
if they do , that future will look much better than today ’ s du@@ sty and desper@@ ate reality .
afri@@ ca at risk
addi@@ s ab@@ aba – climate change will hit afri@@ ca – a continent that has contributed virtually nothing to bring it about – first and har@@ dest .
aside from ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tica , afri@@ ca is the only continent that has not industri@@ alized .
indeed , since 1980 ’ s the industri@@ alization that had taken place in afri@@ ca has by and large been revers@@ ed .
afri@@ ca has thus contributed nothing to the historical acc@@ um@@ ulation of greenhouse gases through car@@ b@@ on-@@ based industri@@ alization .
moreover , its current contribution is also negli@@ gible , practically all of it coming from de@@ fore@@ station and degra@@ dation of forests and farm@@ land .
yet climate change will hit afri@@ ca har@@ dest , because it will cri@@ pp@@ le the continent ’ s vulnerable agricultural sector , on which 70 % of the population depends .
all estimates of the possible impact of global warming suggest that a large part of the continent will become dri@@ er , and that the continent as a whole will experience greater cli@@ matic vari@@ ability .
we know what the impact of perio@@ dic d@@ rou@@ ghts have been on the lives of tens of millions of afri@@ cans .
we can therefore imagine what the impact of a dri@@ er climate on agriculture is likely to be .
conditions in this vital economic sector will become even more prec@@ arious than they currently are .
afri@@ ca will not only be hit har@@ dest , but it will be hit first .
indeed , the long d@@ read@@ ed impact of climate change is already upon us .
the current d@@ rought covering much of east afri@@ ca – far more severe than past d@@ rou@@ ghts – has been directly associated with climate change .
the upcoming climate negotiations ought to address the specific problems of afri@@ ca and simil@@ arly vulnerable poor parts of the world .
this requires , first and most importantly , reducing global warming to the apparently inevitable increase of two degrees cel@@ si@@ us , beyond which lies an environmental catastro@@ phe that could be un@@ manage@@ able for poor and vulnerable countries .
second , adequate resources should be made available to poor and vulnerable regions and countries to enable them to adapt to climate change .
climate change , which was largely brought about by the activities of developed countries , has made it difficult for poor and vulnerable countries to fight poverty .
it has created a more hosti@@ le environment for development .
no amount of money will und@@ o the damage done .
but adequate investment in mitig@@ ating the damage could partly resolve the problem .
developed countries are thus mor@@ ally obliged to pay partial compensation to poor and vulnerable countries and regions to cover part of the cost of the investments needed to adapt to climate change .
various estimates have been made of the scale of investment required by those countries .
one conservative estimate – which has a reasonable chance of being accepted precisely because it is conservative – calls for $ 50 billion per year as of 2015 , increasing to $ 100 billion by 2020 and beyond .
a transitional financing arrangement would be put in place for the period 2010-@@ 2015 .
some argue that developed countries cannot come up with such sums , particularly given their current economic challenges .
but no one has so far argued that the cost of damage caused to the development prospects of poor countries and regions is less than the amount of compensation being offered to cover adjustment costs .
the reason is obvious : the damage caused is many times higher than the compensation being requested .
nonetheless , it is argued , whatever the real cost of the damage , developed countries currently cannot afford to provide that kind of money .
but we all know that these countries and their national banks were able to spend tril@@ li@@ ons of dollars in a few months to ba@@ il out their ban@@ kers , who earned super@@ -@@ profits when the going was good .
when the good times ended , taxpayers and governments were prepared to rescue them and to ensure that they continued to receive their extraordinary bon@@ uses .
if the developed world is able to pay tril@@ li@@ ons of dollars to clean up its ban@@ kers ’ m@@ ess , how is it possible that it cannot afford to pay billions of dollars to clean up a m@@ ess that it created , and that is threatening the survival of whole contin@@ ents ?
clearly this is not about the availability of resources .
it is about the inappropriate priorities in how resources are allocated .
it is about moral values that make it appropriate to rescue ban@@ kers , who expect everyone but themselves to pay for the m@@ ess they created , and inappropriate to compensate the world ’ s poorest people , whose survival is threatened precisely because of the m@@ ess created by developed countries .
i cannot believe that people in developed coun@@ ties , when informed about the issues , would support res@@ cu@@ ing ban@@ kers and oppose partial compensation for poor countries and regions .
i cannot believe that they will let such an in@@ justice occur .
if they are not expressing their ou@@ tra@@ ge over the in@@ justice of it all , it can only be because they are in@@ adequately informed .
three humanitarian challenges for afri@@ ca in 201@@ 8
nai@@ rob@@ i – in mid-@@ 2017 , when a ch@@ ol@@ era outbreak in som@@ alia threatened to overwhel@@ m local hospitals , health experts fe@@ ared the worst .
with crip@@ pling d@@ rought , mal@@ nutrition , and poverty already en@@ demic , an outbreak of dead@@ ly di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a seemed dest@@ ined to par@@ aly@@ ze the fragile state .
but , despite the di@@ re predic@@ tions , institutional par@@ aly@@ sis was avoided .
although hundreds died and many more became si@@ ck , the collective response managed by governments , n@@ gos , and local communities , including the national red c@@ res@@ cent societies supported by the red cross movement , contained the disease .
som@@ alia ’ s experience gives me great hope for afri@@ ca ’ s future .
but it also serves as a remin@@ der that local capacity is easily in@@ und@@ ated during times of crisis .
while some parts of afri@@ ca have become self-@@ sufficient in terms of public health , others continue to lean heavily on global aid .
for these areas , partnership is the best means of minim@@ izing risks .
in particular , three key challenges this year are likely to pose the sever@@ est tests of afri@@ ca ’ s ability to manage humanitarian crises .
the first challenge is violence in the democratic re@@ public of the con@@ go .
last year , conflict in the dr@@ c ’ s central kas@@ ai region displaced some 1.4 million people , bringing the total displaced population to 4.@@ 1 million – the largest concentration of internal refugees anywhere in afri@@ ca .
the violence has exacerb@@ ated food in@@ security , with more than three million people severely under@@ no@@ ur@@ ished .
unfortunately , the kas@@ ai crisis is expected to wor@@ sen in 201@@ 8 .
a recent assessment by the red cross society of the dr@@ c war@@ ns that the number of people displaced will continue to rise , and with a fast-@@ spreading ch@@ ol@@ era outbreak threatening the region , a coordinated plan of action is urgently needed .
the second challenge this year is som@@ alia ’ s food in@@ security , which , according to the fam@@ ine early warning systems network , is expected to intensify this year .
bel@@ o@@ w-@@ average rain@@ fall in 2017 stun@@ ted har@@ v@@ ests , and most regions have not fully recovered .
as humanitarian aid is chann@@ eled to the country , efforts must be made to target long-term solutions , such as improving agricultural output , educational access , and economic opportunity .
histor@@ ically , most aid to the country has been earmarked for emergency relief ; even the collective ch@@ ol@@ era response was narro@@ w@@ ly focused on short-term health .
but som@@ alia desper@@ ately needs a more hol@@ istic , long-term development strategy .
finally , the very s@@ cour@@ ge that som@@ alia contained last year will continue to rear its head elsewhere in the region .
y@@ emen ’ s ch@@ ol@@ era outbreak is now the largest in history , having already sur@@ passed one million confirmed cases , and , despite years of international assistance , the threat continues to stal@@ k afri@@ ca .
in the last four decades , afri@@ can countries reported over three million suspected ch@@ ol@@ era cases to the world health organization and new cases are cro@@ pping up this year in afri@@ ca ’ s e@@ ast-@@ central and southern regions .
fortunately , there is hope that som@@ alia ’ s con@@ tainment success in 2017 can be rep@@ lic@@ ated , provided that communities and individuals are well aware of the disease and related risks , and that local actors receive the needed resources .
the global task force on ch@@ ol@@ era control , which seeks to build local and international support for improved health care and sanit@@ ation , has published a global road@@ map for ending ch@@ ol@@ era by 2030 .
although that is an ambitious target , it is achie@@ vable if international organizations and local governments work together .
natural and man@@ made crises will continue to pla@@ gue afri@@ ca , but organizations like mine are working hard to bring about a bri@@ ghter future through improved capacity building .
to succeed , however , local and international development partners must re@@ ori@@ ent their thinking ; humanitarian aid alone will not solve afri@@ ca ’ s my@@ ri@@ ad challenges .
while money is clearly needed , it must be spent more strategi@@ cally to improve structural weaknesses that perpet@@ u@@ ate instability .
for example , if more funding were devoted to commun@@ ity-@@ level health care projects , local organizations would be better positioned to lead when out@@ breaks threaten .
put simply , the international development community must do more to invest in grass@@ roots solutions , em@@ power@@ ing afri@@ cans rather than treating them as sub@@ contrac@@ tors to their own suffering .
not only are local organizations better positioned to navig@@ ate complex cultural and linguistic landscapes ; they also have more to lose if they fail .
last year was devastating for many afri@@ cans , as millions suffered from d@@ rought , hunger , and violence .
but in som@@ alia , a coordinated response to a serious health threat offered new hope for a more secure future .
when local in@@ genu@@ ity and international support align , the cycle of suffering can be broken .
for many afri@@ can countries , the ability to look confi@@ dently beyond the next crisis is the first step on the long road to self-@@ reli@@ ance .
afri@@ ca , climate change , and the g-@@ 8 summit
bri@@ tish prime minister ton@@ y bla@@ ir has declared that the two issues at the center of the g-@@ 8 summit this ju@@ ly will be afri@@ can poverty and global climate change .
these may seem to be distinct issues .
in fact , they are linked .
a trip i took to a village in the ti@@ gr@@ e region in northern eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia shows why .
one morning , i was taken to a dry ri@@ verb@@ ed at the village ’ s edge .
farmers were dig@@ ging a pit in the ri@@ verb@@ ed , down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level .
they explained that until recently this was a per@@ enni@@ al river – one that flows throughout the year – but now the river stops f@@ lowing during the dry season .
only when the annual ra@@ ins begin in the summer does water re@@ appear in the river bed .
until then , water@@ -@@ star@@ ved communities dig for water , if they can find it and if they can afford to p@@ ump it out .
in northern eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , as in much of afri@@ ca , the rain cycle has changed mark@@ edly in recent years .
eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian village life has long depen@@ ded on two crops , one during a short rain in mar@@ ch and ap@@ ri@@ l , and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months .
in recent years , the short ra@@ ins have failed entirely , and long ra@@ ins have been er@@ ratic .
hunger is om@@ ni@@ present .
perhaps half of the children are severely under@@ weight .
much of ari@@ d sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , notably in the sah@@ el ( the region just south of the sah@@ ara desert ) , has experienced a pron@@ ounced drop in rain@@ fall over the past quar@@ ter-@@ century .
this decline coinci@@ ded with a rise in the surface temperature of the neighbor@@ ing indi@@ an ocean , a hin@@ t that the decline in rain@@ fall is in fact part of the lon@@ ger-@@ term process of man@@ -@@ made global warming .
failures of rain@@ fall contribute not only to fam@@ ines and chronic hunger , but also to the on@@ set of violence when hung@@ ry people clas@@ h over scar@@ ce food and water .
when violence erup@@ ts in water@@ -@@ star@@ ved regions such as dar@@ fur , su@@ dan , political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms .
if they act at all , they mobili@@ ze peac@@ eke@@ ep@@ ers , international sanctions , and humanitarian aid .
but dar@@ fur , like ti@@ gr@@ e , needs a development strategy to fight hunger and d@@ rought even more than it needs peac@@ eke@@ ep@@ ers .
soldiers cannot keep peace among desper@@ ately hung@@ ry people .
one course of action must be to help im@@ pover@@ ished afri@@ can regions to “ adapt ” to climate change and to escape the poverty tra@@ p .
water@@ -@@ stressed regions like eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia and su@@ dan can adapt , at least in part , through improved technologies such as “ dri@@ p ir@@ rig@@ ation , ” rain@@ water har@@ vest@@ ing , improved water storage facilities , deep well@@ s , and ag@@ ro-@@ forestry techniques that make best use of scar@@ ce rain@@ fall .
better land-@@ management practices ( the re-@@ plan@@ ting of degra@@ ded forests , for example ) can re@@ charge underground water a@@ qui@@ fers .
poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own .
nor should they have to .
help for poor countries in afri@@ ca and elsewhere to adapt to climate change should not be described as char@@ ity or aid , but rather as compensation for damages being imposed on the poorest people on the planet .
greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered .
in addition to adapting to climate change , the world must also reduce future risks to the planet by cutting back on emissions of greenhouse gases , which are the source of man@@ -@@ made climate change .
while adaptation to climate change is necessary – because it is already occurring – this is not enough .
if the world fails to mitig@@ ate future climate change , the effects of rising temperatures , increasing d@@ rou@@ ghts , more numerous and severe tropical stor@@ ms , rising sea levels , and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet .
the fam@@ ines in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia and the violence in dar@@ fur suggest what can lie ahead .
the best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions .
there are at least three options : shift to non-@@ carbon energy sources such as solar or nuclear energy ; capture and dis@@ pose of the carbon dioxide emit@@ ted at car@@ b@@ on-@@ based power plants ; econom@@ ize on energy use , for example by shi@@ fting to hybri@@ d automob@@ iles and trucks .
most likely , all three of these methods will have to play a role .
the effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action , but , given the long lead times in over@@ hau@@ ling the world ’ s energy systems , we must start now .
it is ir@@ onic that the united states , which portra@@ ys itself as a friend of democracy and im@@ pover@@ ished countries , gives the smallest share of its gn@@ p in aid among the rich countries , and also ref@@ uses to participate in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
this is especially ir@@ onic because afri@@ can countries like eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia stand ste@@ ad@@ fa@@ stly and bra@@ vely with the us in the fight for freedom and against terrorism , even as they struggle with hunger , disease , and fam@@ ine .
moreover , countries like eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia are making vali@@ ant , indeed remarkable , efforts to overcome their problems , despite the lack of adequate , and long-@@ promised , help from the world ’ s rich@@ est countries .
afri@@ cans suffering from hunger and d@@ rought , and indeed poor people everywhere , have a right to ask much more of the us and other rich countries .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir is right to call on his rich@@ -@@ country colleagues to follow through on their un@@ fulfilled promises .
cap@@ itali@@ zing on afri@@ ca ’ s demographic divi@@ dend
l@@ om@@ é – afri@@ ca is home to the world ’ s yo@@ ung@@ est and fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing population .
with as many as 20 million young people po@@ ised to join the workforce every year for the next three decades , the continent has an opportunity to shift the balance of local and global growth with a purpose : jobs .
but it is far from inevitable that it will do so .
for afri@@ can countries to cap@@ itali@@ ze on this demographic divi@@ dend , the future workforce must be educated , trained , and have adequate employment opportunities .
putting all the pieces in place will not be easy .
these are uncertain times for the global economy .
trade tensions between the united states and ch@@ ina are threatening the integrity of global value chains , and b@@ rit@@ ain ’ s lo@@ oming exit from the europ@@ ean union has the potential to cause even more dis@@ ruption .
the international monetary fund ’ s oc@@ tober forecast war@@ ns that as historic economic drivers st@@ all , global growth this year and next could fall to 3.@@ 7 % , a decline of 0.@@ 2 percentage points from previous estimates .
but as this slow@@ down gets priced in by stock markets around the world , new drivers of growth will emerge .
afri@@ ca is well positioned to become one of them .
according to the world bank , six of the world ’ s ten fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing economies are in afri@@ ca .
in@@ tra-@@ afri@@ can trade might be the g@@ ateway to future local and global growth , with the continent ’ s bur@@ ge@@ oning population for@@ ging new opportunities across borders .
most significantly , afri@@ ca ’ s labor force is on the ver@@ ge of a dramatic expansion .
today , 60 % of afri@@ cans are younger than 25 , and 41 % are under the age of 15 . by 2050 , afri@@ ca ’ s youth population is expected to reach 8@@ 40 million .
but this massive pool of potential talent is a double-@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word .
despite strong g@@ d@@ p growth over the last ten years , the majority of young people in afri@@ ca could not capture economic opportunities .
furthermore , the afri@@ can union / o@@ ec@@ d report afri@@ ca ’ s development dynam@@ ics 201@@ 8 highlights that if the under@@ employment trend continues , afri@@ ca ’ s young people will suffer the most .
failing to employ afri@@ ca ’ s young people fully could margin@@ alize an entire generation and lead them down a path of dis@@ ruption for which we may not be prepared .
for countries to experience job@@ -@@ led long-term growth , the provision of quality opportunities in agriculture is vital .
if that does not happen , and quality jobs remain scar@@ ce , the economic expansion of which afri@@ ca is capable will not happen .
in other words , afri@@ can governments are facing a deadline to match job growth with skills training .
unfortunately , at the moment , few countries are addressing this challenge effectively .
according to the afri@@ can development bank , the unemployment rate for young people in afri@@ ca is already double the rate for adults .
in fact , young people are being let down even before they start looking for work .
too many primary schools suffer from crip@@ pling teacher short@@ ages , for example , and gender discrimination prevents millions of girls from even attending high school .
to overcome these shortcomings will require significant investments of political and financial capital .
some leaders are moving in this direction .
at the par@@ is peace forum ( pp@@ f ) , held earlier this month , afri@@ can and global leaders gathered to discuss the powerful idea that international cooperation is the key to tackling global challenges and ensuring dur@@ able peace .
on the si@@ delines of the pp@@ f , the focus fell on afri@@ can youth .
the au@@ -@@ eu youth cooperation hub , one of 1@@ 19 projects selected to participate in the forum , attended the meeting to discuss the au@@ -@@ eu youth agenda .
stri@@ ving to involve young people across afri@@ ca and europ@@ e in decisions that impact them , now and in the future , this initiative aims to show@@ case strategies for bringing afri@@ ca and europ@@ e together to address challenges such as the demographic divi@@ dend .
one approach to cap@@ itali@@ zing on afri@@ ca ’ s demographic boom is to expand the availability of training initiatives that pair employers ’ needs with afri@@ can talent .
as a former fellow with the i@@ bra@@ him leadership program , i can att@@ est to the transform@@ ative power of top-@@ tier educational schemes and their value as inc@@ ub@@ ators for job@@ -@@ related skills .
afri@@ ca ’ s success re@@ lies on its ability to har@@ ness its demographic divi@@ dend by equi@@ pping its youth with technological and innovative skills , which will be a cataly@@ st for economic growth .
this includes training and agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ focused programs to absor@@ b skills along the value chains that connect raw materials to industries and markets across afri@@ ca .
by 2030 , one in every five people on the planet will be afri@@ can .
because of its size alone , afri@@ ca ’ s labor force will have the potential to drive global growth for decades .
but to do so , afri@@ cans must implement the necessary reforms today .
as our demographic divi@@ dend mat@@ ures , governments , institutions , and organizations must help position young people for success .
if afri@@ can countries can meet this challenge , prolong@@ ed economic growth – at home and abroad – will be the reward .
the promise of digital health
bas@@ el – afri@@ ca has changed remark@@ ably , and for the better , since i first worked as a young doctor in ang@@ ola some 20 years ago .
but no change has been more obvious than the way the continent has adopted mobile technology .
people in afri@@ ca – and , indeed , throughout low@@ - and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries – are sei@@ zing the opportunities that technology provides , using mobile phones for everything from making payments to issuing birth certificates , to gaining access to health care .
the benefit of mobile technologies lies in access .
barriers like geographical distance and low resources , which have long prevented billions of people from getting the care they need , are much easier to overcome in the digital age .
and , indeed , there are countless ways in which technology can be deployed to improve heal@@ th-@@ care access and delivery .
of course , this is not new information , and a growing number of techn@@ olog@@ y-@@ based health initiatives have taken shape in recent years .
but only a few have reached scale , and achieved long-term sustainability ; the majority of projects have not made it past the pilot phase .
the result is a highly frag@@ mented landscape of digital solutions – one that , in some cases , can add extra stra@@ in to existing health systems .
the first step to addressing this problem is to identify which factors bre@@ ed success – and which impede it .
here , perhaps the most important observation relates to how the solution is linked to the reality on the ground .
solutions that focus on end-@@ users , whether health practi@@ tioners or patients , have the best chance of succ@@ ee@@ ding .
fundamental to this approach is the recognition that what users need are not necessarily the most advanced technologies , but rather solutions that are easy to use and implement .
in fact , seem@@ ingly out@@ dated technologies like voice and text messages can be far more useful tools for the intended users than the latest app@@ s or c@@ utt@@ ing-@@ edge innovations in , say , nano@@ technology .
the project supports patients in self-@@ managing their condition through regular mobile medic@@ ation remin@@ ders , as well as advice on necessary lifestyle changes .
this approach is successful because it is pati@@ ent-@@ c@@ entered and le@@ verages information and communication technology ( ic@@ t ) tools that are re@@ adily available and commonly used .
in a country where mobile penet@@ ration exceeds 80 % but only a few people have sm@@ art@@ phones , such simple solutions can have the greatest impact .
for health practi@@ tioners , digital solutions must be perceived as boosting efficiency , rather than adding to their al@@ read@@ y-@@ heavy work@@ load .
co-@@ creating solutions with people experienced in delivering health care in low-@@ resource settings can help to ensure that the solutions are adopted at scale .
for example , the tel@@ em@@ e@@ dic@@ ine network that the nov@@ arti@@ s foundation and its partners rolled out with the gh@@ ana health service was a direct response to the need , expressed by heal@@ th-@@ care practi@@ tioners on the ground , to expand the reach of medical expertise .
the network connec@@ ts fron@@ t@@ line health workers with a simple phone call to consultation centers in refer@@ ral hospitals several hours away , where doctors and specialists are available aro@@ und-@@ the-@@ clock .
from the outset , the project was a response to an expressed need to expand the reach of medical expertise , and was fully operated on the ground by gh@@ ana health service staff , which made this model sustainable at scale .
to realize the full potential of digital health , solutions need to be integrated into national health systems .
only then can digital technology accelerate progress toward universal health coverage and address countries ’ priority health needs .
collaboration across the health and ic@@ t sectors , both public and private , is essential .
multi@@ disciplinary partnerships driven by the sustained leadership of senior government officials must guide progress , beginning at the planning stage .
in@@ tra-@@ governmental collaboration , dedicated financing for digital health solutions , and effective governance mechanisms will also be vital to successful strategies .
digital technologies offer huge opportunities to improve the way health care is delivered .
if we are to sei@@ ze them , we must learn from past experience .
by remaining focused on the reality of end-@@ users and on priority health needs , rather than being da@@ zz@@ led by the latest technology , we can fulfil the promise of digital health .
confron@@ ting afri@@ ca ’ s water challenge
ab@@ id@@ jan – water is essential for life , and yet it is scar@@ ce in many parts of the world .
owing to the effects of climate change , afri@@ ca is experiencing its worst d@@ rought since 1945 , especially in southern su@@ dan , som@@ alia , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , and northern ni@@ geri@@ a .
these fragile areas now need the global community ’ s support .
we need to build re@@ sili@@ ent systems to ensure access to po@@ table water for all people , and to improve water@@ -@@ delivery and sanit@@ ation provisions in afri@@ ca ’ s rapidly growing urban areas .
we should begin by expanding afri@@ cans ’ capacity to har@@ ness wa@@ ste@@ water .
with investment and proper management , wa@@ ste@@ water can become a sustainable source of wealth for many afri@@ cans , with added benefits for human health , agricultural productivity , and environmental sustainability .
over the past six years , the afri@@ can development bank has invested $ 3.@@ 3 billion in projects to expand access to water and improve sanit@@ ation , with around $ 2.2 billion of that going to urban services that reach at least 17 million people .
the af@@ d@@ b supports an integrated urban water@@ -@@ management model ( i@@ u@@ w@@ m ) that , in keeping with united nations sustainable development goal 6 , enables communities to deri@@ ve a sustainable income from management of urban liquid and solid waste .
i@@ u@@ w@@ m efforts require a significant initial investment , and come with steep capital and operational costs .
only a few afri@@ can cities collect and treat any more than 20 % of the wa@@ ste@@ water generated through centr@@ alized wa@@ ste@@ water@@ -@@ management systems .
the remaining 80 % constitutes a huge un@@ ta@@ pped source of potentially valuable liquid and solid waste .
with the right investment , fore@@ sight , and commitment , this under@@ appreciated resource can create jobs and deliver sustainable growth .
wa@@ ste@@ water management is thus a central feature of the af@@ d@@ b ’ s strategic priorities , known as the high 5@@ s , which aim to improve afri@@ cans ’ quality of life , boost public health , achieve gender equality , create jobs , and increase communities ’ re@@ sili@@ ence to the effects of climate change .
water will also play a key role in reaching the high 5@@ s ’ industri@@ alization and sustain@@ ab@@ le-@@ farming objectives .
in y@@ ao@@ und@@ é , cam@@ ero@@ on , the af@@ d@@ b helped to protect some 300@@ ,000 people and their property by reducing the frequency of floods from 15 incidents per year to just three .
and with a $ 40 million sanit@@ ation project , the af@@ d@@ b helped to lower the proportion of the city ’ s mal@@ ari@@ a-@@ aff@@ lic@@ ted population from 16 % to 12 % .
in ab@@ id@@ jan , c@@ ô@@ te d ’ i@@ vo@@ ire , the $ 23 million af@@ d@@ b-@@ funded g@@ ou@@ ro@@ u basin integrated water@@ shed management project significantly reduced floo@@ ding throughout the g@@ ou@@ ro@@ u basin , and improved 2.@@ 8 million inhabitants ’ live@@ li@@ hoods .
in zim@@ babwe , after 4,@@ 300 people died in the 2008-@@ 2009 ch@@ ol@@ era pan@@ demic , the af@@ d@@ b and other donors supported the $ 4@@ 3.@@ 6 million urgent water supply and sanit@@ ation rehabilitation project , which made emergency repa@@ irs to wa@@ ste@@ water systems in urban areas , helping 2.5 million people .
all af@@ d@@ b-@@ supported wa@@ ste@@ water@@ -@@ management systems follow sustainability strategies to ensure that they enhance economic gains , benefit local communities , and remain affordable .
these projects also help countries to har@@ ness and use waste flows , by conver@@ ting se@@ wage to bio@@ gas and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er .
mean@@ while , the af@@ d@@ b ’ s afri@@ can water facility ( aw@@ f ) comple@@ ments its projec@@ t-@@ finance work by attrac@@ ting down@@ stream investments in water infrastructure .
in f@@ ebru@@ ary , floo@@ ding and strong win@@ ds from tropical storm d@@ ine@@ o dev@@ ast@@ ated the coast of mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que and had a severe impact on the local population .
but just a few weeks later , the aw@@ f launched a fea@@ sibility study to improve live@@ li@@ hoods and cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ change re@@ sili@@ ence throughout mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que ’ s in@@ ham@@ ban@@ e province , where the storm struck .
in collaboration with the global water partnership , the aw@@ f is implementing i@@ u@@ w@@ m systems in five afri@@ can cities , including kin@@ sh@@ asa in the democratic re@@ public of con@@ go and mar@@ onder@@ a in zim@@ babwe .
in the dr@@ c alone , i@@ u@@ w@@ m systems can be expected to improve water delivery and sanit@@ ation for 17 million people by 2030 .
the bill &@@ amp@@ ; mel@@ in@@ da g@@ ates foundation is also ta@@ pping into the af@@ d@@ b ’ s expertise , by providing an $ 18 million grant to fund phase ii of the af@@ d@@ b ’ s urban sanit@@ ation program .
this effort will help to develop business innovations for affordable and sustainable sanit@@ ation services in afri@@ ca , which could reach two million urban d@@ well@@ ers directly and another six million people through subsidiary projects .
afri@@ ca ’ s wa@@ ste@@ water@@ -@@ management challenges are substantial and complex .
but the af@@ d@@ b is determined to provide opportunities that pay divi@@ den@@ ds for afri@@ can communities – in public health , improved sanit@@ ation , economic development , and environmental protection .
improving the quality of life for all afri@@ cans will require political commitment , public-@@ private partnerships , and robust public involvement .
with the high 5@@ s framework , the af@@ d@@ b is working to bring these three ingredients together .
all stakeholders – in afri@@ ca and internationally – must re@@ double our efforts to ensure clean , affordable water for all , and to support afri@@ can countries suffering through a historic d@@ rought .
we have a moral obligation to do so .
after all , water means life .
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – between 2000 and 2014 , afri@@ ca grew at a strong cli@@ p , fu@@ eling belief in the nar@@ r@@ ative of an “ afri@@ ca rising . ”
but , since 2015 , growth across sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca has weak@@ ened , and the poor outlook for commodity prices has cast doubt on afri@@ ca ’ s economic promise , leading many to question the “ afri@@ ca rising ” nar@@ r@@ ative – and some to pron@@ ounce it dead .
such skep@@ tic@@ ism is , to some extent , understandable .
the 2014 o@@ il-@@ price shock hit several afri@@ can economies especially hard , and played a role in pushing aggreg@@ ate growth down from 5-@@ 6 % in 2004-@@ 2014 to just 2.5 % in 201@@ 5-@@ 2017 – a rate that barely keeps up with population growth .
moreover , the continent &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s three largest economies – ang@@ ola , ni@@ geri@@ a , and south afri@@ ca – have experienced major dec@@ lines in performance .
last year , ang@@ ola and south afri@@ ca ’ s economies stag@@ n@@ ated , while the ni@@ geri@@ an economy actually contrac@@ ted for the first time since 1991 .
the latest projec@@ tions suggest that these economies will experience te@@ p@@ id recover@@ ies in the coming years .
but afri@@ ca ’ s skep@@ tics have over@@ looked a number of important factors .
for star@@ ters , when one sets the three largest economies aside , sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca ’ s aggreg@@ ate-@@ growth rate for this year rises from 2.5 % to almost 4 % .
that is faster than the 3.5 % rate at which the global economy is currently growing .
in fact , five of the ten fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing economies in the world are in afri@@ ca .
and over the next five years , around half of all sub-@@ sah@@ aran economies will expand at an average rate similar to or higher than that which prev@@ ailed during the “ afri@@ ca rising ” he@@ y@@ day .
furthermore , high commodity prices were just one factor in the region ’ s strong economic performance between 2000 and 2014 .
many afri@@ can countries have made vast improvements to macroeconomic management , governance , and the business environment , and entrepreneurship is on the rise .
even with lower commodity prices , these developments will continue to bol@@ ster many afri@@ can economies .
today ’ s skep@@ tic@@ ism may reflect lasting memories from a dark@@ er period , and fears that afri@@ ca ’ s progress has not been sufficiently consolidated .
from the 1970s to the mid-@@ 1990s , dict@@ ators ruled in many afri@@ can countries , and the institutions necessary for su@@ sta@@ ining strong economic growth were fragile at best .
with civil wars constantly sh@@ red@@ ding the social fabric in many countries , the continent experienced decades of te@@ p@@ id economic growth .
by 2000 , it had been reduced to what the econom@@ ist called “ hop@@ eless afri@@ ca . ”
but those days are gone .
policymakers across the continent have sustained the 199@@ 0@@ s-@@ era reforms that set the stage for the subsequent period of high growth .
although there is still much work to be done , the economic and business environment in many afri@@ can countries has continued to improve , and institutions and governance have grown stronger .
owing to new information and communication technologies , afri@@ cans , particularly young afri@@ cans , are better informed , more engaged in civil and political dis@@ course , and increasingly capable of holding their leaders accountable .
ic@@ ts have also un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed a wave of innovation and entrepreneurship across the continent .
these positive trends are not likely to be revers@@ ed , and will continue to improve the economic conditions in afri@@ ca , even if commodity prices do not re@@ bound .
after all , the region ’ s economic growth aver@@ aged 5.@@ 6 % between 2000 and 2004 , before commodity prices had begun their rapid as@@ cent .
but that is not to say afri@@ ca will be sp@@ ared from da@@ un@@ ting challenges in the years ahead .
globally , the economic environment will become less favor@@ able for afri@@ can economies .
in the major advanced economies , interest rates will soon rise , and the political bac@@ kl@@ ash against globalization may force governments to abandon their past commitments to development assistance .
in light of all this uncertainty , afri@@ can policymakers should look in@@ ward , by focusing on policies to mobili@@ ze national resources and finance their economic agen@@ das .
those agen@@ das should include a number of key priorities .
afri@@ can countries need to diversi@@ fy their economies to with@@ stand future sho@@ cks better , while also acceler@@ ating the pace of industri@@ alization across the continent .
governments will have to find a way to create decent jobs for the 11 million people now entering the region ’ s labor force every year .
and they will need to en@@ act policies to reduce poverty , and ensure that prosperity is shared across all co@@ h@@ orts of society .
these are particularly important goals for ang@@ ola , ni@@ geri@@ a , and south afri@@ ca .
ang@@ ola and ni@@ geri@@ a need to become far less reli@@ ant on oil ; and south afri@@ ca still needs to implement far-reaching reforms to address structural problems that have pla@@ gu@@ ed it since the apar@@ thei@@ d era .
seeing these projects through will require competent political leaders who are committed to the principles of good governance .
failure could result in an extended period of low growth .
but even if afri@@ ca ’ s three largest economies do end up in the dol@@ dru@@ ms , it will not necessarily se@@ al the fate of the “ afri@@ ca rising ” story .
after all , “ afri@@ ca rising ” need not mean “ all ” of afri@@ ca .
from the 196@@ 0s to the 1990s , the “ asi@@ an tig@@ ers ” nar@@ r@@ ative referred only to h@@ ong kon@@ g , sin@@ ga@@ por@@ e , south korea , and ta@@ i@@ wan , excluding other developing countries in a@@ sia , such as ch@@ ina .
simil@@ arly , afri@@ can economies are increasingly differenti@@ ating themselves , and should thus be evaluated individually , on the merits of their respective economic policies .
afri@@ ca ’ s scho@@ oling without learning
acc@@ ra – as the school year began this se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber , there was welcome news for gh@@ ana ’ s nearly half-@@ million students entering high school : president n@@ ana aku@@ fo@@ -@@ ad@@ do had fulfilled his campaign promise of free secondary education for children nation@@ wide .
he s@@ wor@@ e not only to do away with ad@@ missions fees , but also to provide free text@@ books and meals , the cost of which had often remained a barrier for the poorest students .
gh@@ ana had introduced free compulsory education at the primary and j@@ unior high school levels in 1995 , but implementation had been pain@@ fully slow – and students ’ educational dreams were often cut off before high school .
even in 2014 , only 37 % of the nation ’ s students were en@@ rolled in secondary school , owing to high fees .
the president ’ s move is thus an inspir@@ ing example that gh@@ ana ’ s neigh@@ b@@ ors should follow .
unfortunately , despite progressive reforms like these , students across afri@@ ca still face other steep barriers to a truly comprehensive education .
in gh@@ ana , for example , poor and rural children are unlikely to re@@ ap the full benefits of their new access to secondary education .
the situation is argu@@ ably worse elsewhere on the continent .
the issue is not only lack of access to schools , but also lack of good schools .
the results of a stag@@ gering new report from the un@@ esco institute of statistics show that six out of ten children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents around the world – 600 million in total – are not achieving basic skills in mathemati@@ cs and reading .
in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , it is estimated that 88 % of children and te@@ en@@ agers will enter adul@@ th@@ ood without basic liter@@ acy .
this constitutes a moral and development crisis that demands immediate action .
having served as head of the department of ga@@ -@@ dan@@ g@@ me education at the university of education in win@@ ne@@ ba , i know from first-@@ hand experience that one of the main problems is lack of education and absen@@ te@@ e@@ ism among teachers themselves .
the world bank , which simil@@ arly raised the issue of “ scho@@ oling without learning ” in a new report , has cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated my view .
addressing this issue requires investing more in teachers ’ col@@ leges , promoting teaching as the career of nation@@ -@@ buil@@ ders , and encouraging the best and bri@@ gh@@ test students to asp@@ ire to a teaching career .
we cannot expect students to learn from po@@ or@@ ly educated , po@@ or@@ ly paid teachers .
we must also invest more in resources for schools and learning across the board , from schol@@ ar@@ ships for poor students to new libraries and class@@ room equipment .
with so many afri@@ can governments already failing to provide equal , high-quality access to education for their citizens , this is not a challenge that they can take on alone .
as the continent ’ s population bo@@ oms – half of the world ’ s population growth between 2017 and 2050 is expected to occur here – afri@@ can heads of state will have to work closely with key allies and multilateral organizations to bring in funding and share know-how .
fortunately , with the launch of the un@@ esco report , several partners have already step@@ ped up .
f@@ ren@@ ch president em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron is perhaps the most prominent of those who have promised to make investment in education in afri@@ ca a high priority .
as the un ’ s main educational and cultural organization , un@@ esco itself will play a key role in promoting initiatives to bring free , high-quality scho@@ oling to students across the continent .
and wh@@ o@@ ever takes over un@@ esco , following the election of a new direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general next month , will have a ma@@ ke-@@ or-@@ break opportunity to craft the right agenda to meet this challenge .
currently , the organization is mi@@ red in a financial crisis and intern@@ ec@@ ine disputes , and it will need a leader who has the vision to solve both internal and external problems .
notably , fran@@ ce ’ s candidate , former minister of culture and communication au@@ dre@@ y az@@ ou@@ lay , has put both un@@ esco ’ s internal crisis and education at the top of her agenda .
she has sin@@ gl@@ ed out the financial crisis as the biggest threat facing un@@ esco and has stressed the need for greater dialogue with members in arre@@ ars , like the united states .
in her previous governmental roles , az@@ ou@@ lay helped launch a global plan for cultural diversity through books and introduced plans to protect cultural heritage in conflict zones .
az@@ ou@@ lay also has called for un@@ esco to treat education as a cataly@@ st for development and gender equality , and as the best way to help combat the “ radic@@ alization of the mind . ”
if elected , she has promised to put sustainable development goal 4 – universal quality education – at the heart of un@@ esco ’ s mission , with a special focus on afri@@ ca .
the pre@@ am@@ ble to the constitution of un@@ esco decla@@ res , “ since wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the def@@ enses of peace must be constructed . ” unfortunately , in afri@@ ca , we know all too well what happens when efforts to construct the def@@ enses of peace ultimately fail .
islam@@ ist insur@@ gen@@ ts continue to pose a threat to mal@@ i , where in 2013 , they set fire to a library holding thousands of pri@@ cel@@ ess historical man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts in the ancient cultural center of tim@@ bu@@ kt@@ u .
the incident was not only a devastating b@@ low to world heritage ; it was also a remin@@ der of afri@@ ca ’ s history as a center for cultural exchange , liter@@ acy , and learning , and a call to action .
the sta@@ kes for afri@@ ca are high .
our children are threatened not only by lack of access to schools , but also by lack of opportunities to learn , and by the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable frag@@ ments of their rich history .
we must hope that more governments follow gh@@ ana ’ s example , that more allies like fran@@ ce increase their support , and that the new director general will place a high priority on un@@ esco ’ s missions in afri@@ ca , which are more critical than ever .
afri@@ ca ’ s year of opportunity
gen@@ eva – we are still near the start of 201@@ 8 , and already it feels like tension and dis@@ order will be the year ’ s defining characteristics .
from anti-@@ immigration policies in the united states to f@@ lar@@ ing geo@@ political hot@@ spots in the middle east and east a@@ sia , dis@@ ruption , up@@ heav@@ al , and uncertainty seem to be the order of the day .
but at least one met@@ ric offers reason for cau@@ tious optim@@ ism : economic growth .
the international monetary fund estimates that global growth will reach 3.@@ 7 % this year , up from 3.@@ 6 % in 2017 .
as christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de , the fund ’ s managing director , put it in a speech in dec@@ ember , “ the sun is sh@@ ining through the cl@@ ou@@ ds and helping most economies generate the strongest growth since the financial crisis . ”
it was fitting that la@@ gar@@ de made that observation in addi@@ s ab@@ aba , because it is in afri@@ ca where the rays of prosperity are sh@@ ining bri@@ gh@@ test .
in fact , i pre@@ dict that 201@@ 8 will be a break@@ out year for many – though not all – afri@@ can economies , owing to gains in eight key areas .
for star@@ ters , afri@@ ca is po@@ ised for a modest , if frag@@ mented , growth recovery .
following three years of weak economic performance , overall growth is expected to accelerate to 3.5 % this year , from 2.@@ 9 % in 2017 .
this year ’ s projected gains will come am@@ id improved global conditions , increased oil output , and the eas@@ ing of d@@ rought conditions in the east and south .
to be sure , growth will be un@@ even .
while nearly a third of afri@@ can economies will grow by around 5 % , slow@@ down@@ s are likely in at least a do@@ zen others .
sharp increases in public debt , which has reached 50 % of g@@ d@@ p in nearly half of sub-@@ sah@@ aran countries , are particularly worrying .
but , overall , afri@@ ca is positioned for a positive year .
second , afri@@ ca ’ s political landscape is liber@@ alizing .
some of afri@@ ca ’ s lon@@ ge@@ st-@@ serving presiden@@ ts – including zim@@ babwe ’ s ro@@ bert mu@@ gabe , ang@@ ola ’ s jo@@ s@@ é e@@ du@@ ardo dos san@@ tos , and the g@@ ambi@@ a ’ s y@@ ah@@ ya j@@ am@@ me@@ h – ex@@ ited in 2017 .
in south afri@@ ca , jac@@ ob zu@@ ma ’ s re@@ sign@@ ation allowed cy@@ ri@@ l ra@@ ma@@ pho@@ sa to become president .
in jan@@ u@@ ary , li@@ beri@@ ans witnessed their country ’ s first peaceful transfer of power since 1944 , when former so@@ cc@@ er star ge@@ or@@ ge we@@ ah was s@@ wor@@ n into office .
all of these gains will be tested , however , as voters in 18 countries go to the p@@ olls this year .
adding to afri@@ ca ’ s story of diver@@ gence will be continued political fra@@ gil@@ ity in a number of states , including the central afri@@ can re@@ public , bur@@ undi , ni@@ geri@@ a , south su@@ dan , and som@@ alia .
a third source of optim@@ ism is afri@@ ca ’ s agricultural sector , where the potential of small@@ holder farmers , the majority of whom are women , is finally being realized .
afri@@ can agricultural output is forecast to reach $ 1 tril@@ lion by 2030 .
this mat@@ ur@@ ation could not have come at a more opport@@ une time ; roughly two-@@ thirds of afri@@ cans depend on agriculture to make ends meet .
large trac@@ ts of un@@ cultiv@@ ated land , a you@@ thful workforce , and the emergence of te@@ ch-@@ sav@@ vy “ ag@@ ro@@ prene@@ urs ” – agricultural entrepreneurs – are lifting production and trans@@ forming entire economies .
fourth , afri@@ cans are benefiting from technological dis@@ ruption .
with more than 9@@ 95 million mobile subscri@@ bers , afri@@ ca ’ s increasing connec@@ tivity is being used to power innovation .
key sectors like farming , health , education , banking , and insurance are already being transformed , greatly enhancing the region ’ s business landscape .
fifth , afri@@ can leaders are getting serious about cur@@ bing il@@ licit financial out@@ flows from cor@@ rupt practices that ro@@ b afri@@ can countries of some $ 50 billion annually , much of it in the oil and gas sector .
while us law@@ makers are pushing to repe@@ al por@@ tions of the 2010 do@@ d@@ d-@@ fran@@ k financial reform legislation – which contains a provision requiring oil , gas , and mining companies to disc@@ lose payments they make to governments – the broader trend is toward greater transparency and accountability .
for example , the pan@@ ama papers and the paradise papers pul@@ led back the cur@@ tain on the mur@@ ky system of tax ha@@ vens and shell companies that shel@@ ter billions of dollars from some of the world ’ s poorest countries , including many in afri@@ ca .
and with the g@@ 20 and the o@@ ec@@ d working to stop tax avoid@@ ance , afri@@ ca may soon benefit from global efforts to end sha@@ dy accounting .
sixth , afri@@ ca ’ s energy sector is set to thri@@ ve .
while 6@@ 21 million afri@@ cans still lack reliable access to electricity , innovations like renew@@ ables , mini-@@ gri@@ ds , and smart me@@ tering are bringing power to more people than ever before .
in south afri@@ ca , renewable energy has taken off ; the price of wind power is now competitive with coal .
eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , ken@@ ya , mor@@ occo , and r@@ wand@@ a are also attrac@@ ting large investments in renewable energy .
a sevent@@ h area showing signs of progress is education .
to be sure , afri@@ ca ’ s educational offer@@ ings remain dis@@ mal ; more than 30 million children in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca are not in school , and those who do attend are not learning as much as they could .
but many afri@@ can leaders and public@@ s have recognized these deficiencies ; in some countries , such as gh@@ ana , education has even become a deciding issue for voters .
as the education commission highlights , some countries are boosting investments in education .
this represents an opportunity to align learning outcomes with future employment needs .
but with over a billion young people living in afri@@ ca by 2050 , greater investment in education is urgently needed .
finally , greater attention is being paid to developing a pan@@ -@@ afri@@ can identity , and afri@@ can fashi@@ ons , films , and foods are expanding to new markets .
as these cultural connections grow , afri@@ ca ’ s soft power will continue to rise and extend far beyond the continent .
in many cor@@ ners of the world , 201@@ 8 is shaping up to be yet another dis@@ appointing year , as inequality and poverty continue to fuel anger and popul@@ ism .
afri@@ ca will not be entirely imm@@ une from such developments .
nonetheless , the continent ’ s inhabitants have at least eight good reasons – far more than most people elsewhere – to be optimistic .
gender equity for afri@@ ca ’ s scientists
k@@ ig@@ ali – a girl in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia could grow up to engine@@ er a new method for improving agricultural yiel@@ ds , if only she could meet the right ment@@ or .
a young woman in mal@@ aw@@ i has ideas for new cancer treatments , but will never apply them if she is pushed out of school .
and a girl in r@@ wand@@ a has all the skills to create a mathemati@@ cal model to mitig@@ ate d@@ rou@@ ghts ; all she needs is a research grant to help her pay for college .
there is a global gender im@@ balance in science , technology , engineering , and mathemati@@ cs – the so-called stem discipl@@ ines .
but in afri@@ ca , this im@@ balance is doing more than threatening individual fut@@ ures . it is also depri@@ ving the continent of tal@@ ents and contributions needed to drive development and progress .
a 2011 afri@@ can development bank report finds that “ getting women into science and technology ultimately promises to benefit society as a whole . ”
gender equity in stem is achie@@ vable , and many afri@@ can schol@@ ars are showing the world how to do it .
but they need help , and programs that offer schol@@ ar@@ ships and support are among the best ways to achieve par@@ ity in the sciences .
the causes of afri@@ ca ’ s stem gender im@@ balance are often compared to a le@@ ak@@ y pi@@ pe : girls start out with interest and ap@@ titude , but drop out of the discipl@@ ines at various points in their education .
early data from a master@@ card foundation initiative aimed at revers@@ ing these trends show that a comprehensive approach to plug@@ ging the le@@ aks can make a difference .
“ science needs us ” is how ar@@ mand@@ a k@@ ou@@ ass@@ i , an industrial engine@@ er and former master@@ card foundation schol@@ ar , puts it . “ with different ideas and perspectives come better solutions and thinking that can move scientific innovations forward and benefit the whole of afri@@ ca . ”
k@@ ou@@ ass@@ i is right .
afri@@ ca cannot afford to squ@@ ander its young , female talent .
sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca faces a short@@ fall of some 2.5 million engineers , techn@@ ologists , mathemati@@ cians , and scientists .
this de@@ ar@@ th of expertise threat@@ ens a number of sustainable development goals , such as food security , health care , clean water and sanit@@ ation , energy , and infrastructure .
removing gender barriers to stem requires afri@@ can governments to make equity in the sciences a priority .
no@@ where is this happening more successfully than in r@@ wand@@ a , where our collective experience has helped more than 1,@@ 250 girls and young women exc@@ el in stem discipl@@ ines .
the afri@@ can institute for mathemati@@ cal sciences ( aims ) , in r@@ wand@@ a ’ s capital , k@@ ig@@ ali , is one of these agents of change .
the school believes that the next ein@@ stein could be an afri@@ can woman , an educational approach that inform@@ s its comprehensive strategy to p@@ lug le@@ aks in the stem development pipeline .
aims ’ s innovative approach includes helping governments train teachers , ensure that female students are not v@@ ast@@ ly ou@@ tn@@ um@@ ber@@ ed in their class@@ rooms , support students who are mothers , and engage with industry leaders to help gradu@@ ates succeed in their care@@ ers .
to attract more female students , 30 % of the school ’ s schol@@ ar@@ ships are reserved for female applicants , and the school as@@ pi@@ res to reach 50 % in the near future .
simil@@ arly , car@@ neg@@ ie m@@ ell@@ on university afri@@ ca ( c@@ mu@@ -@@ afri@@ ca ) , also in k@@ ig@@ ali , is champi@@ oning change by al@@ locating 30 % of its schol@@ ar@@ ships to young women .
these commitments will have a positive effect on the entire institution , as c@@ mu@@ -@@ afri@@ ca seeks to increase dramatically en@@ roll@@ ment of female scientists .
finally , the forum for afri@@ can women educ@@ ation@@ alists ( fa@@ we ) in r@@ wand@@ a has funded the education of 1,@@ 200 girls en@@ rolled at the country ’ s top-@@ performing secondary schools speci@@ alizing in stem subjects .
of these students , an estimated 70 % are expected to study science at the university level .
despite these positive developments , quotas alone will not achieve par@@ ity .
to make lasting gains , opportunities outside the class@@ room are also needed .
at fa@@ we r@@ wand@@ a , a program called t@@ us@@ eme ( a s@@ wah@@ il@@ i word meaning “ let ’ s speak out ” ) offers girls leadership training through drama , song , and creative arts to teach presentation , negotiation , and decision-making skills .
fa@@ we r@@ wand@@ a also works with teachers to develop gen@@ der-@@ respon@@ sive ped@@ ago@@ gical methods .
likewise , at c@@ mu@@ -@@ afri@@ ca , schol@@ ars are invited to participate in the university ’ s meeting of the minds sym@@ posi@@ um , an annual global gathering for under@@ gradu@@ ates to show@@ case their work to a wider audience of fac@@ ul@@ ty , students , government officials , and industry representatives .
and , the next ein@@ stein forum , a select program at aims that recogni@@ zes afri@@ ca ’ s best young scientists and techn@@ ologists – of which 40 % are women – provides emerging innov@@ ators with an opportunity to lead their own research while inspir@@ ing the next generation of scientific thin@@ kers .
as re@@ be@@ cca , a master@@ card foundation schol@@ ar from ug@@ anda , re@@ members , “ when i was at my school , the boys used to call us ‘ half-@@ men , ’ because if you ’ re a la@@ dy and you go for sciences , you ’ re a half-@@ man . ” but , re@@ be@@ cca adds , “ it was cool being a science student . ”
afri@@ ca needs more women who share re@@ be@@ cca ’ s enthusiasm for stem .
to ensure that science remains appe@@ aling to girls , schools , governments , and industries must cooperate to educ@@ ate teachers and ment@@ ors , and allocate funding to close the gender gap .
as mir@@ anda , another master@@ card foundation schol@@ ar , recently observed , “ as we try to find new innovations and in@@ ven@@ tions to drive the economy , i believe that math and science is at the fore@@ front of that progress . ” as professionals working to improve afri@@ can education , we couldn ’ t agree more .
health coverage must not ignore afri@@ ca ’ s elderly
dar es sal@@ a@@ am – my grand@@ mother is 76 , and my grand@@ father is 83 . they have lived fruit@@ ful lives together , cultiv@@ ating crops and gra@@ zing cattle in a remote village in the hills of sou@@ thwest ug@@ anda .
but whenever i think of them , i am more in a@@ we of their good health than their hard work .
because of the remo@@ teness of their community , any@@ time my grand@@ parents need medical care , they must travel 25 miles to the nearest hospital on motor@@ cycles known as bo@@ da@@ -@@ bo@@ das , paying about 50@@ ,000 ug@@ and@@ an sh@@ ill@@ ings ( about $ 13 ) for the ro@@ und-@@ trip journey .
then , because they were recently dropped from their heal@@ th-@@ insurance plan due to age , they must c@@ ough up more money to foot the bill for treatment .
in other words , for my grand@@ parents – and for many older afri@@ cans – a visit to the doctor is on@@ erous , costly , and exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly rare .
access to health care is an ob@@ session for experts in international development .
in may , at the world health organization ’ s annual world health assembly , officials from doz@@ ens of countries discussed how to achieve universal health coverage through the united nations sustainable development goals .
and yet , most of the attention c@@ entered on mothers , new@@ bor@@ ns , and children ; elderly populations in developing countries were largely ignored .
failure to address this om@@ is@@ sion would leave an increasing share of the population without access to affordable health care .
according to the world bank , life expec@@ tan@@ cy in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca has risen steadily in recent decades , from just 40 years in 1960 to 60 years today .
if this trend continues , the number of afri@@ cans living past their 60@@ th birthday will more than double by 2050 .
this is of course good news ; lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity is a key indicator of human development .
but afri@@ ca ’ s el@@ der boom will be a disaster if living longer means living si@@ cker because of inadequate health care .
in ug@@ anda , many rural heal@@ th-@@ care centers lack the personnel , supplies , and infrastructure to meet the needs of older patients .
small clin@@ ics typically refer their oldest patients to the closest big hospital , which is often many miles away .
travel@@ ing by motor@@ cycle over rou@@ gh terrain can wor@@ sen health conditions ; but with no other options , the fra@@ il must choose between a b@@ ump@@ y ride on the back of a bike and no treatment at all .
it ’ s hard to blame those who opt for the latter .
according to a 2010 survey by doctors at the mu@@ la@@ go national refer@@ ral hospital in kamp@@ ala , bo@@ da@@ -@@ bo@@ das are ug@@ anda ’ s leading cause of ro@@ ad-@@ related in@@ juries .
during the survey period , motor@@ cycle passengers accoun@@ ted for 41 % of the hospital ’ s 1,@@ 500 trau@@ ma cases , and ri@@ ders ’ in@@ juries consu@@ med 6@@ 2.5 % of the hospital ’ s surgery budget .
given the dangers of travel , it is no wonder that my grand@@ parents are reluc@@ tant to seek medical care .
of course , the biggest obstacle to health care in ug@@ anda – like everywhere else – is money .
in 2015 , researchers at ma@@ ker@@ ere university found that household income is the main determin@@ ant of elderly people ’ s access to and use of heal@@ th-@@ care services .
the story is similar in the united states , where average annual heal@@ th-@@ care costs have been increasing for decades .
but while older patients in the us can turn to medi@@ care ( which accoun@@ ted for 15 % of federal spending in 2017 ) , the elderly in most afri@@ can countries have less government support .
still , a de@@ ar@@ th of dedicated resources does not mean that afri@@ ca ’ s leaders must ignore their older constitu@@ ents .
by combining el@@ der-@@ care services with existing programs , health benefits can be extended to under@@ served populations .
for example , single-@@ sector initiatives , like hi@@ v / aids treatment schemes , could include el@@ der@@ ly-@@ friendly heal@@ th-@@ care components .
heal@@ th-@@ care workers who serve expec@@ tant and new mothers could also be trained to provide in-@@ home care for the elderly in multi@@ gener@@ ational households .
these types of initiatives would not require vast sums of money ; rather , the most important factor in launching them is political support and effective program integration .
developing countries have made considerable gains when it comes to improving health care for the young .
now , we must do the same for the elderly .
in ug@@ anda , the government ’ s national heal@@ th-@@ care strategy could easily be strengthened by adding sen@@ iors to the list of so-called vulnerable groups .
integrating el@@ der-@@ care options into existing frameworks – such as the health extension program in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , the commun@@ ity-@@ based health program in tan@@ z@@ ania , and village health teams in my country – are other ways to extend coverage .
finally , community heal@@ th-@@ insurance schemes must be over@@ hau@@ led to prevent the exclusion of poor older patients .
to maintain coverage and protect the elderly from financial ru@@ in , reforms are needed to create plans that are financially sound and drawn from a larger pool of subscri@@ bers .
we all year@@ n to live long , healthy , productive lives – just as my grand@@ parents have .
but without lifelong access to quality health care , lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity will be more luck than science .
the integrity of any society can be judged by how well it tre@@ ats its yo@@ ung@@ est and oldest members .
that calcul@@ us applies to governments , too .
afri@@ ca ’ s mu@@ st-@@ do decade
vi@@ enn@@ a – since 2000 , afri@@ ca has recorded impressive rates of economic growth , owing largely to development assistance and a prolong@@ ed commodity boom .
while the continent shows great diversity in the soci@@ o@@ economic tra@@ jec@@ tories , growth rates have generally mas@@ ked an underlying lack of structural transformation .
many afri@@ can countries have yet to under@@ go the kind of transformation that is necessary for socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable development over the long term : namely , industri@@ alization .
wherever industri@@ alization has occurred , it has reli@@ ably improved economic diversification and helped to nur@@ ture , strengthen , and uphold the conditions for competitive growth and development .
in recent decades , some developing countries – mainly in a@@ sia – have managed to industri@@ alize .
but , despite repeated attempts , afri@@ can countries have not .
in 2014 , the a@@ sia and p@@ aci@@ fic region ’ s share of value added in global manufacturing was 4@@ 4.@@ 6 % , whereas afri@@ ca ’ s was just 1.6 % .
with south afri@@ ca as its only industri@@ alized country , sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca is the least industri@@ alized region in the world .
for afri@@ can countries to achieve sustainable development , they will have to increase substantially the share of industry – especially manufacturing – in their national investment , output , and trade .
and , to their credit , most afri@@ can countries already recognize that such a transformation is necessary to address a wide range of inter@@ connected challenges that they are now confron@@ ting .
one such challenge is population growth .
more than half of the continent ’ s 1.2 billion people are under the age of 19 , and almost one in five are between the ages of 15 and 24 . each year , 12 million new workers join the labor force , and they will need the tools and skills to ensure their future live@@ li@@ hoods .
industri@@ alization is the key to helping afri@@ ca ’ s fast-@@ growing population realize a demographic divi@@ dend .
a related challenge is migration .
many of afri@@ ca ’ s most ambitious and entreprene@@ uri@@ ally minded young people are joining others in mig@@ rating north .
but no country , especially in afri@@ ca , can afford to lose so much talent and potential .
industri@@ alization alone cannot resolve the migration crisis , but it can address one root cause , by creating jobs in the countries of origin .
a third challenge is climate change , which weigh@@ s heavily on countries where agriculture is still the primary sector for employment .
to confront the threat , afri@@ ca will need to develop and adopt green technologies , while chann@@ eling more investment into resource efficiency and clean energy .
with the right investments , afri@@ can countries can reduce the cost of delivering power to rural areas , and contribute to global efforts to reduce emissions and mitig@@ ate the effects of climate change .
in short , afri@@ ca must industri@@ alize , and it must do so in a socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable manner .
given that most previous efforts at sustainable development in afri@@ ca have failed , there is a clear need for a new approach : a broad@@ -based , countr@@ y-@@ owned process that ta@@ ps financial and non-@@ financial resources , promotes regional integration , and fo@@ sters cooperation among afri@@ ca ’ s development partners .
as it happens , the united nations general assembly has declared 201@@ 6-@@ 20@@ 25 to be the third industrial development decade for afri@@ ca .
during id@@ da i@@ ii , the united nations industrial development organization , which i lead , will sp@@ ear@@ head the new approach to sustainable development sk@@ et@@ ched above .
uni@@ do has put its full support behind partnerships for mobi@@ liz@@ ing resources , and is offering a tested model for afri@@ can countries to follow : the programme for country partnership ( p@@ c@@ p ) .
uni@@ do ’ s p@@ c@@ p provides countries with technical assistance , policy advice , and investments to help them design and implement industri@@ alization strategies .
the program was launched in 2014 , and is already being successfully implemented in two afri@@ can countries – eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia and sen@@ egal – and in per@@ u .
the p@@ c@@ p provides a multi-@@ stakehol@@ der partnership model that can be adapted to each country ’ s national development agenda .
it is designed to work in syn@@ ergy with governments and their partners ’ ongoing development efforts , while fun@@ n@@ eling additional funds and investments toward sectors that have high growth potential and are important to a particular government ’ s industri@@ al-@@ development agenda .
priority sectors are typically chosen for their job@@ -@@ creation , investment , and export potential , and for their access to necessary raw materials .
the p@@ c@@ p approach is designed to maxim@@ ize the impact of all partner programs and projects that are relevant to industrial development .
to that end , strategic partnerships with financial institutions and the business sector are particularly important .
with these in place , afri@@ can countries can mar@@ sh@@ al additional resources for infrastructure , innovation , expertise , and new technologies .
uni@@ do ’ s goal is to make the p@@ c@@ p model the main@@ stream approach for all afri@@ can countries .
we stand ready to support afri@@ ca on its path to inclusive and sustainable industrial development – during id@@ da i@@ ii and beyond .
vi@@ enn@@ a – in today ’ s inter@@ dependent global economy , afri@@ ca remains a weak link .
if the world is to achieve the sustainable development goals , thereby completing the united nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development , it must help afri@@ ca accelerate its development by promoting rapid and responsible industri@@ alization .
afri@@ ca is by no means dest@@ ined to lag behind the rest of the world economy .
on the contrary , it could easily become a global economic power@@ house – and within the next decade .
but , to ful@@ fill its economic potential , afri@@ ca must industri@@ alize .
the importance of this has been stressed repeatedly at recent international forums , including last aug@@ ust ’ s sixth to@@ k@@ yo international conference on afri@@ can development ( tic@@ ad vi ) , and the g@@ 20 summit in hang@@ zh@@ ou , ch@@ ina , the following month .
for the first time , the g@@ 20 placed industri@@ alization in afri@@ ca – and all of the least developed countries ( ld@@ cs ) – on its agenda .
the afri@@ can union ’ s agenda 20@@ 63 also supports this drive .
the recent un general assembly resolution declar@@ ing 201@@ 6-@@ 20@@ 25 the third industrial development decade for afri@@ ca is yet another push in this direction .
the organization that i represent , the un industrial development organization ( uni@@ do ) , has been t@@ asked with operation@@ alizing and leading the implementation of the con@@ comit@@ ant program , including mobi@@ liz@@ ing the needed resources .
all of these declarations and commitments are an important first step .
but they will mean little unless they are translated into concrete and effective action that advances afri@@ can industri@@ alization , creates jobs , and fo@@ sters inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development .
the question is how .
the short answer is money and action .
we must challenge the international community and development partners to back their words with real financial commitments .
and we must build partnerships to operation@@ alize programs that will enable afri@@ ca to become the world ’ s next main engine of economic growth .
such programs must recognize and tackle the acute challenges the continent faces .
indeed , growth rates vary widely across the continent , and not all afri@@ cans are benefiting .
though the middle class in afri@@ ca has expanded mark@@ edly in recent years , generating a consumer boom and boosting domestic investment , many people still struggle to make a living .
unemployment rates are high , especially for young people and women – a reality that drives many afri@@ cans to head north .
to keep them home , afri@@ ca ’ s economies must move beyond producing raw materials to build dynamic and competitive manufacturing sectors with higher value added .
here , afri@@ ca must draw on the opportunities presented by participation in global and regional value chains .
new and innovative industri@@ al-@@ development strategies , as well as carefully tailored measures to attract foreign direct investment , must be introduced .
of course , to develop such strategies and participate effectively in industrial value chains , afri@@ cans need knowledge .
investment in education and skills training is imperative to facilitate successful and lasting industri@@ alization .
by understanding and drawing on proven innovations from around the world , afri@@ ca could le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g more developed countries technologi@@ cally , building the capacity to produce more sophisticated , hig@@ her@@ -@@ value goods .
knowledge of other countries ’ experiences will also help afri@@ ca to avoid the pit@@ falls of un@@ bri@@ d@@ led industri@@ alization – particularly environmental damage .
afri@@ ca must ensure that its industri@@ al-@@ development strategy includes effective environmental safeguards .
afri@@ ca is well placed to industri@@ alize .
beyond its massive natur@@ al-@@ resource en@@ dow@@ ments , the continent has a favor@@ able demographic profile ( its rapidly growing population means that it will soon have the world ’ s largest workforce ) and high ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation rates .
it also benefits from a highly educated di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
but industri@@ alization is never automatic .
governments must step up to address market failures , while planning , implementing , and enfor@@ cing industrial policies that address the shortcomings of previous in@@ effective versions .
they must then institution@@ alize these new policies in national and regional development strategies .
to succeed , governments will need adequate capacity , competence , and legitimacy to mobili@@ ze and inter@@ act with all stakeholders , thereby creating an attractive investment climate .
the necessary reforms will open the way for public-@@ private partnerships , which can provide investment for infrastructure development and maintenance .
they will also facilitate cooperation with international organizations and development finance institutions , which can provide additional funds , while helping countries to upgrade their productive capacity .
a recent report , prepared for the hang@@ zh@@ ou g@@ 20 summit , features a number of recommendations for afri@@ ca .
it suggests support for agriculture and agri@@ business development and linking them with other sectors , as well as measures to boost re@@ sili@@ ence to price sho@@ cks .
furthermore , the report empha@@ sizes the need to deep@@ en , bro@@ aden , and update the local knowledge base , invest in energ@@ y@@ - and materi@@ al-@@ resource efficiency , and promote green technologies and industries .
other recommendations relate to trade and regional integration , le@@ ver@@ aging domestic and external finance , and promoting what it calls the “ new industrial revolution . ”
my numerous meetings with afri@@ can leaders and visits to doz@@ ens of countries across the continent have convinced me that afri@@ ca is committed to industri@@ alization .
in fact , the process is already underway in many countries , including eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , gh@@ ana , r@@ wand@@ a , and sen@@ egal .
by offering our commitment and support , we can enable these countries to realize inclusive and sustainable development for the benefit of everyone .
banking on afri@@ can infrastructure
j@@ oh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg – as the us federal reserve embark@@ s on the “ great un@@ win@@ ding ” of the stimulus program it began nearly a decade ago , emerging economies are growing anxi@@ ous that a stronger dollar will adver@@ sely affect their ability to service dol@@ lar@@ -@@ den@@ omin@@ ated debt .
this is a particular concern for afri@@ ca , where , since the se@@ y@@ ch@@ elles issued its de@@ but euro@@ bond in 2006 , the total value of outstanding euro@@ bonds has grown to nearly $ 35 billion .
but if the fed ’ s ongoing withdrawal of stimulus has fra@@ yed afri@@ can ner@@ ves , it has also sp@@ urred recognition that there are sm@@ ar@@ ter ways to finance development than borro@@ wing in dollars .
of the available options , one specific asset class stands out : infrastructure .
afri@@ ca , which by 2050 will be home to an estimated 2.6 billion people , is in di@@ re need of funds to build and maintain roads , ports , power gri@@ ds , and so on .
according to the world bank , afri@@ ca must spend a stag@@ gering $ 93 billion annually to upgrade its current infrastructure ; the vast majority of these funds – some 87 % – are needed for improvements to basic services like energy , water , sanit@@ ation , and transportation .
yet , if the recent past is any guide , the capital needed will be difficult to secure .
between 2004 and 2013 , afri@@ can states closed just 15@@ 8 financing deals for infrastructure or industrial projects , valued at $ 59 billion – just 5 % of the total needed .
given this track record , how will afri@@ ca fund even a fra@@ ction of the world bank ’ s projected requirements ?
the obvious source is institutional and foreign investment .
but , to date , many factors , including poor profit projec@@ tions and political uncertainty , have limited such financing for infrastructure projects on the continent .
investment in afri@@ can infrastructure is perceived as simply being too ris@@ ky .
fortunately , with work , this perception can be overcome , as some investors – such as the afri@@ can development bank , the development bank of southern afri@@ ca , and the trade &@@ amp@@ ; development bank – have already demonstrated .
companies from the private sector are also prof@@ itably financing projects on the continent .
but these are the exceptions , not the rule .
fully funding afri@@ ca ’ s infrastructure short@@ fall will require attrac@@ ting many more investors – and swiftly .
to succeed , afri@@ ca must develop a more coherent and coordinated approach to cour@@ ting capital , while at the same time working to mitig@@ ate investors ’ risk exposure .
for example , in the energy sector , independent power producers are working with governments to provide electricity to 6@@ 20 million afri@@ cans living off the grid .
priv@@ ately funded but government regulated , these producers operate through power purchase agreements , whereby public uti@@ lities and regulators agree to purchase electricity at a pre@@ determined price .
there are approximately 130 such producers in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , valued at more than $ 8 billion .
in south afri@@ ca alone , 47 projects are underway , accounting for 7@@ ,000 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of additional power production .
similar priv@@ ate-@@ public partnerships are emerging in other sectors , too , such as transportation .
among the most promising are toll roads built with private money , a model that began in south afri@@ ca .
not only are these projects , which are slowly appearing elsewhere on the continent , more profitable than most financial market investments ; they are also literally p@@ aving the way for future growth .
that is why i , along with other afri@@ can business leaders and policymakers , have called on afri@@ ca ’ s institutional investors to commit 5 % of their funds to local infrastructure .
we believe that with the right incentives , infrastructure can be an innovative and attractive asset class for those with long-term li@@ abilities .
one sector that could lead the way on this commitment is the continent ’ s pension funds , which , together , possess a balance sheet of about $ 3 tril@@ lion .
the 5 % agenda campaign , launched in new y@@ or@@ k last month , under@@ sco@@ res the belief that only a collabor@@ ative public-@@ private approach can red@@ ress afri@@ ca ’ s infrastructure short@@ fall .
for years , a lack of bank@@ able projects deter@@ red international financing .
but in 2012 , the afri@@ can union adopted the program for infrastructure development in afri@@ ca , which ki@@ ck-@@ started more than 400 energy , transportation , water , and communications projects .
it was a solid start – one that the 5 % agenda seeks to build upon .
but some key reforms will be needed .
a high priority of the 5 % agenda is to assist in updating the national and regional regulatory frameworks that guide institutional investment in afri@@ ca .
simil@@ arly , new financial products must be developed to give asset owners the ability to allocate capital directly to infrastructure projects .
un@@ lo@@ cking new pools of capital will help create jobs , encourage regional integration , and ensure that afri@@ ca has the facilities to accommodate the needs of future generations .
but all of this depends on persu@@ ading investors to put their money into afri@@ can projects .
as business leaders and policymakers , we must ensure that the conditions for profit@@ ability and social impact are not mutually exclusive .
when development goals and profits align , everyone wins .
cap@@ turing afri@@ ca ’ s high returns
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – since 2000 , at least half of the world ’ s fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing economies have been in afri@@ ca .
and by 2030 , afri@@ ca will be home to 1.@@ 7 billion people , whose combined consumer and business spending will total $ 6.@@ 7 tril@@ lion .
seven years ago , the har@@ v@@ ard business review pointed out that afri@@ ca is also home to many of the world ’ s biggest opportunities .
and yet , despite its tremendous business potential , afri@@ ca has not risen to the top of western business leaders ’ agen@@ das .
in fact , between 2014 and 2016 , us exports to afri@@ ca fell by almost half , from $ 38 billion to $ 22 billion .
and while the united king@@ dom ’ s investments on the continent more than dou@@ bled between 2005 and 2014 , reaching £ 4@@ 2.5 billion ( $ 5@@ 7.@@ 6 billion ) , only 2.5 % of its total exports are to afri@@ ca .
western countries are quickly losing ground to ch@@ ina , which increased its exports to afri@@ ca more than seven@@ fold – to $ 103 billion – from 2005 to 2015 .
if western businesses hope to keep up , they will need to tap into the afri@@ can countries and sectors with the highest potential for growth .
by 2030 , more than half of afri@@ ca ’ s population will re@@ side in seven countries : ni@@ geri@@ a , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , the democratic re@@ public of con@@ go , eg@@ yp@@ t , tan@@ z@@ ania , ken@@ ya , and south afri@@ ca .
but , more important , 43 % of afri@@ cans will belong to the middle or upper classes , up from 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % in 2013 , im@@ plying considerably higher demand for goods and services .
by 2030 , household consumption is expected to reach $ 2.5 tril@@ lion , up from $ 1.1 tril@@ lion in 2015 .
nearly half of that $ 2.5 tril@@ lion will be spent in three countries : ni@@ geri@@ a ( 20 % ) , eg@@ yp@@ t ( 17 % ) , and south afri@@ ca ( 11 % ) .
but there will also be lu@@ cr@@ ative opportunities in al@@ geri@@ a , ang@@ ola , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , gh@@ ana , ken@@ ya , mor@@ occo , su@@ dan , and tun@@ isi@@ a .
any one of these countries would be a good bet for companies seeking to enter new markets .
by 2030 , the sectors generating the most value in afri@@ ca will be food and beverages ( $ 7@@ 40 billion ) , education and transportation ( $ 3@@ 97 billion ) , and housing ( $ 3@@ 90 billion ) .
but there will also be strong growth in consumer goods ( $ 3@@ 70 billion ) , hospitality and recreation ( $ 260 billion ) , health care ( $ 175 billion ) , financial services ( $ 85 billion ) , and telecommunications ( $ 65 billion ) .
of course , much of this growth will depend on the afri@@ can union properly implementing its new continental free trade area , which would create a single market for goods and services , offering corporations many points of entry .
moreover , the c@@ ft@@ a will increase the need for connec@@ tivity , so there will be new opportunities to invest in infrastructure and sectors ranging from transportation and energy to information and communications technology ( ic@@ t ) and water supplies .
for its part , the afri@@ can development bank can help investors find promising projects through its program for infrastructure development in afri@@ ca .
another major growth area between now and 2030 will be in afri@@ can business@@ -to-@@ business spending , which will reach $ 4.@@ 2 tril@@ lion , up from $ 1.6 tril@@ lion in 2015 .
here , the largest sectors will be agriculture and agricultural processing ( $ 9@@ 15 billion ) , manufacturing ( $ 6@@ 66 billion ) , and construction , uti@@ lities , and transportation ( $ 7@@ 84 billion ) , followed by wholesale and retail ( $ 6@@ 65 billion ) , resources ( $ 35@@ 7 billion ) , banking and insurance ( $ 24@@ 9 billion ) , and telecommunications and ic@@ t ( $ 7@@ 9.@@ 5 billion ) .
the expected growth in agriculture and agricultural processing reflects the fact that food and beverages will constitute the largest share of total household spending .
moreover , 60 % of the world ’ s un@@ used ar@@ able land is in afri@@ ca , which still contributes a me@@ ager share of worldwide agricultural exports .
that means there is a lot of room for growth .
and , because severe hunger still affects many afri@@ can countries , investors can even contribute to the public good by investing in fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , machinery , water and ir@@ rig@@ ation systems , and other areas of the agriculture sector .
as of 2012 , the afri@@ can countries with the highest agricultural valu@@ e-@@ added in terms of annual growth included bur@@ k@@ ina fas@@ o , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , ni@@ geri@@ a , mal@@ i , mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que , r@@ wand@@ a , and tan@@ z@@ ania .
in addition , ang@@ ola , mor@@ occo , and south afri@@ ca now all have si@@ z@@ able markets , and have committed to expanding their agricultural sectors .
according to the har@@ v@@ ard business review , afri@@ ca also has the potential to become “ the world ’ s next great manufacturing center . ”
ch@@ ina is expected to lose from 8@@ 5-@@ 100 million low-@@ cost , lab@@ or-@@ intensive manufacturing jobs by 2030 , and afri@@ ca stands to capture many of them .
this helps to explain why manufacturing will be the second-@@ largest sector in terms of business@@ -to-@@ business spending .
another reason is that many of the manufacturing opportunities in afri@@ ca happen to be in globally competitive sectors such as automob@@ iles and transport equipment , refined pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um , computers , and office and industrial machinery .
south afri@@ ca , eg@@ yp@@ t , and ni@@ geri@@ a are already becoming promising places to invest in these areas .
and investors will also be able to find high returns and favor@@ able business environments in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , mor@@ occo , and r@@ wand@@ a .
afri@@ ca is the world ’ s last frontier market , and western businesses need to start taking advantage of its tremendous potential , as chin@@ ese firms already are .
doing business in afri@@ ca will also create sustainable jobs and advance the united nations sustainable development goals to eliminate poverty and hunger .
and that , too , will be good for the bottom line . as the business and sustainable development commission has shown , pursuing the s@@ d@@ gs “ could raise tril@@ li@@ ons in new market opportunities in ways that extend prosperity to all . ”
the high cost of food monopolies in afri@@ ca
la@@ gos – in may , global food prices increased 1.2 % , reaching their highest level since oc@@ tober 2017 .
this up@@ ward tra@@ jec@@ tory is having a disproportionate impact in afri@@ ca , where the share of household income spent on food is also rising .
to ensure food security , governments must work quickly to reverse these trends , and one place to start is by polic@@ ing the producers who are feeding the fr@@ enz@@ y .
ni@@ geri@@ a leads the list , with a stag@@ gering 5@@ 6.@@ 4 % of household income in 2015 spent on food , followed by ken@@ ya ( 4@@ 6.@@ 7 % ) , cam@@ ero@@ on ( 4@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) , and al@@ geri@@ a ( 4@@ 2.5 % ) .
by comparison , consumers in the united states spend the least globally ( 6.@@ 4 % ) , far less than people in emerging economies like bra@@ zi@@ l ( 16 % ) and indi@@ a ( 30 % ) .
one reason for the distortion is the price of food relative to income .
as afri@@ ca ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zes , people are buying more imported semi@@ - or fully processed foods , which cost more than locally produced foods .
and in most countries , wages have not kept pace with inflation .
but the primary cause is poor public policy : afri@@ can governments have failed to cur@@ b the power of agri@@ businesses and large food producers , a lack of over@@ sight that has made local agriculture less competitive .
in turn , prices for most commodities have risen .
the absence of anti@@ trust laws , combined with weak consumer protection , means that in many countries , only two or three major companies control markets for items like salt , sugar , fl@@ our , milk , oil , and tea .
the impact is most pron@@ ounced in afri@@ can cities , where prices for white rice , frozen chi@@ cken , bread , but@@ ter , eggs , and even car@@ bon@@ ated soft drinks are at least 24 % higher than in other cities around the world .
these prices hit consumers both directly and indirectly ( owing to pass@@ -@@ through of higher input costs by food con@@ glomer@@ ates and service providers ) .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations ( fa@@ o ) has long argued that food security and fair pricing depends on markets that are free from monopol@@ istic tenden@@ cies .
the o@@ ec@@ d conc@@ urs , and has frequently called on authorities to address “ anti-@@ competitive mergers , abuse of domin@@ ance , car@@ tels and price fixing , vertical restra@@ ints , and exclusive practices ” in the food sector .
and yet , in many afri@@ can countries , this advice has rarely been he@@ eded .
between 1997 and 2004 , for example , the fa@@ o counted 12@@ 2 alleg@@ ations of “ anti-@@ competitive practices ” in 23 countries in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca . violations included a “ vertical monopoly ” in the mal@@ aw@@ i sugar sector , price fixing in ken@@ ya ’ s fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er industry , and a “ buyer car@@ tel ” in the zim@@ bab@@ we@@ an cotton industry .
and , despite the considerable attention such cases have received , the underlying problems pers@@ ist .
according to the world bank , more than 70 % of afri@@ can countries rank in the bottom half globally for efforts to protect “ market-@@ based competition . ”
while 27 afri@@ can countries and five regional b@@ loc@@ s do have anti@@ trust laws on the books , enforcement is rare .
the remaining countries have no regulations at all and have made little progress in drafting them .
there is one notable exception : south afri@@ ca .
since 1998 , the country ’ s competition act has prohibited any company controlling at least 45 % of the market from excluding other firms or seeking to exercise control over pricing .
as tem@@ bin@@ ko@@ si bon@@ ak@@ ele , head of south afri@@ ca ’ s competition commission , noted last year , the government is “ determined to root out exploitation of consumers by car@@ tels , ” especially in the food industry .
other countries should follow south afri@@ ca ’ s lead .
companies and speci@@ al-@@ interest groups will always seek to benefit from the absence of regulation .
the need for reform is greatest in countries like ni@@ geri@@ a and gh@@ ana , where food expendi@@ tures are high and foo@@ d-@@ industry pressure is most pron@@ ounced .
fortunately , there is growing recognition of the need to address these challenges .
bab@@ at@@ unde i@@ ru@@ k@@ era , director general of the consumer protection council in ni@@ geri@@ a , recently asser@@ ted that , “ in a large vibrant and lo@@ yal market such as ni@@ geri@@ a , the absence of broad competition regulation is tragic .
un@@ regulated markets in competition context constitute the otherwise ‘ legitimate ’ vehicle for both financial and social ex@@ tor@@ tion . ”
reducing the prices of st@@ ap@@ le food by even a modest 10 % ( far below the average premium car@@ tels around the world charge ) by tackling anti@@ competitive behavior in these sectors , or by reforming regulations that sh@@ ield them from competition , could lift 27@@ 0,000 people in ken@@ ya , 200@@ ,000 in south afri@@ ca , and 20@@ ,000 in z@@ ambi@@ a out of poverty .
such a policy would save households in these countries over $ 700 million ( 2015 us dollars ) a year , with poor households gaining dis@@ proportion@@ ately more than rich ones .
ultimately , it is the responsibility of political leaders to protect consumers from col@@ lu@@ sion and pri@@ ce-@@ fixing .
there is no question that afri@@ ca ’ s businesses need space to innov@@ ate and grow , but their success should never come at the cost of someone else ’ s next meal .
ch@@ ic@@ ago – one of the most pressing public-@@ health challenges in afri@@ ca today is also one of the least reported : cancer , a leading cause of death worldwide .
every year , some 6@@ 50@@ ,000 afri@@ cans are diagno@@ sed with cancer , and more than a half-@@ million die from the disease .
within the next five years , there could be more than one million cancer deaths annually in afri@@ ca , a sur@@ ge in mortality that would make cancer one of the continent ’ s top k@@ ill@@ ers .
throughout sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , tremendous progress has been made in combating dead@@ ly infec@@ tious diseases .
in recent decades , international and local cooperation have reduced afri@@ ca ’ s malaria deaths by 60 % , pushed poli@@ o to the br@@ ink of eradication , and extended the lives of millions of afri@@ cans infected with hi@@ v / aids .
unfortunately , similar gains have not been made in the fight against non-@@ communic@@ able diseases ( n@@ c@@ ds ) , including cancer .
today , cancer k@@ ills more people in developing countries than aids , malaria , and tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis combined .
but , with afri@@ ca receiving only 5 % of global funding for cancer prevention and control , the disease is out@@ pac@@ ing efforts to contain it .
just as the world united to help afri@@ ca beat infec@@ tious disease out@@ breaks , a similar collabor@@ ative approach is needed to halt the cancer crisis .
survi@@ ving cancer requires many things , but timely access to specialists , labor@@ atories , and second opinions are among the most basic .
yet , in much of afri@@ ca , a lack of affordable medic@@ ations , and a de@@ ar@@ th of trained doctors and nur@@ ses , means that patients rarely receive the care they need .
on average , afri@@ can countries have fewer than one trained path@@ olog@@ ist for every million people , meaning that most diagno@@ ses come too late for treatment . according to university of ch@@ ic@@ ago on@@ c@@ olog@@ ist ol@@ u@@ fun@@ mil@@ ay@@ o ol@@ op@@ ade , a diagnosis of cancer in afri@@ ca is “ nearly always fat@@ al . ”
building heal@@ th-@@ care systems that are capable of managing infec@@ tious diseases , while also providing quality cancer care , requires a significant investment in time , money , and expertise .
fortunately , afri@@ ca already has a head start .
past initiatives – like the global fund to fight aids , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , and malaria , the us president ’ s emergency plan for aids relief , and the world bank ’ s east afri@@ ca public health laboratory networking project – have greatly expanded the continent ’ s medical infrastructure .
national efforts are also strengthening pharmaceutical supply chains , improving medical training , and increasing the quality of diagno@@ stic networks .
still , afri@@ cans cannot face down this threat alone .
that is why the ameri@@ can society for clinical path@@ ology , where i work , is cooperating with other global heal@@ th-@@ care innov@@ ators to attack the region ’ s growing cancer crisis .
to complement these technical efforts , the ac@@ s is also training afri@@ can heal@@ th-@@ care professionals how to carry out bi@@ op@@ sies and deliver chem@@ o@@ therapy .
that initiative , funded by nov@@ arti@@ s , is viewed as a pilot program that could expand to other regional countries .
finally , our organizations are advoc@@ ating for enhanced can@@ cer@@ -@@ treatment guidelines in national heal@@ th-@@ care planning efforts , protocols that we believe are essential to improving health outcomes .
these initiatives are in conjunction with other undertakings , such as a joint ac@@ s-@@ clin@@ ton health access initiative program to bro@@ aden access to cancer medic@@ ations .
when the world took notice that infec@@ tious diseases like hi@@ v / aids , poli@@ o , and malaria were ra@@ v@@ aging afri@@ ca , action plans were drawn up and solutions were delivered .
today , a similar global effort is needed to ensure that every afri@@ can with a cancer diagnosis can get the treatment they need .
now , as then , success depends on coordination among afri@@ can governments , heal@@ th-@@ service providers , drug makers , and non-governmental organizations .
there is no place on earth that is imm@@ une from the dre@@ ad of a cancer diagnosis ; wherever the news is delivered , it is often devastating to recipi@@ ents and their families .
but geograph@@ y should never be the deciding factor in patients ’ fight to survive the disease .
cancer has been afri@@ ca ’ s silent kil@@ ler for far too long , and the global health community must no longer remain quiet in the face of this crisis .
investing in afri@@ ca ’ s educ@@ ators
j@@ oh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg – improving education is a slow , ar@@ du@@ ous , long-term undertaking everywhere , and no@@ where more so than in afri@@ ca , where tight economic constraints often prevent sustained investment in human capital .
those who work in the education sector on the continent have to seek solutions that are faster , cheaper , and can be sc@@ aled up .
too often , though , expe@@ dient approaches prove short@@ si@@ ghted , and fail to engage local leaders who hold the keys to economic and social progress .
too often , grass@@ roo@@ ts-@@ level voices , reflecting fir@@ sth@@ and experience addressing their communities ’ problems , are ignored .
when global leaders gather in ham@@ burg this week for the g@@ 20 summit , the new g@@ 20-@@ afri@@ ca partnership will take center stage .
but those committed to helping afri@@ ca should focus squ@@ are@@ ly on the nu@@ ts and bol@@ ts of aid and development – and that means investing in local leadership .
sad@@ ly , the best-@@ funded aid organizations in afri@@ ca are often run by west@@ ern@@ ers , or by afri@@ cans who have extensive ties to the west .
i recently spoke to several entrepreneurs who shared an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal evidence that organizations in afri@@ ca with a western co-@@ founder raise more than twice the funds of afri@@ can@@ -@@ run organizations .
this financial prejudice is visible elsewhere , too , and it is perpet@@ u@@ ating the de@@ ar@@ th of local talent .
the pro-@@ western bi@@ as should worry everyone working to build better communities for our children .
when it comes to addressing social issues – whether it ’ s educational in@@ equity , poverty , or discrimination – the most committed advocates are those who have first-@@ hand knowledge of the problem they seek to solve .
personal experience is the best way to create agents for change , because it underp@@ ins people ’ s long-term , personal investment in disman@@ tling systems that exacerb@@ ate in@@ equity and in@@ justice .
what would it look like if the leaders over@@ hau@@ ling such systems were cultiv@@ ated from the very communities that needed them most ?
some organizations are answer@@ ing that question already .
more than 12@@ ,000 people have applied to join teach for ni@@ geri@@ a , a national organization that recru@@ its , trains , and places young teachers in high-@@ need schools .
the program , designed as a fel@@ low@@ ship , will choose fewer than 60 of ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s bri@@ gh@@ test university gradu@@ ates and professionals , not only to develop excellent class@@ room teachers , but also to em@@ power the next generation of social entrepreneurs committed to tackling in@@ equity and deeply connected to local efforts already underway in communities across their country .
after their two-@@ year teaching commitment , which begins in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber , these up-@@ and-@@ coming leaders will join a worldwide movement of over 55@@ ,000 people who have completed the fel@@ low@@ ship in over 40 countries , including the 30 fel@@ lows already hard at work next door at teach for gh@@ ana .
we call this powerful group@@ ing of chan@@ ge-@@ agents “ collective leadership , ” and we believe it is the only way to ensure positive , lasting change .
inadequate investment in locally led initiatives is one of the two ways in which we fail to ensure that those who are most affected by in@@ equity have path@@ ways to address it .
the second is the failure to invest in children .
in ug@@ anda , 70 % of children do not complete primary school .
basic education is the foundation for our lifelong ability to analy@@ ze information , present ideas and opinions , and challenge the world around us .
and yet , in too many afri@@ can communities , we are failing to invest in laying those foundations .
across the continent , educational at@@ tainment is sharp@@ ly str@@ ati@@ fied : while 82 % of children from the weal@@ thi@@ est families complete primary school , only 28 % of children from the poorest families do .
if the future of the continent is to be shaped by , or with , those who have most ac@@ utely experienced its challenges , programs like teach for ni@@ geri@@ a and teach for gh@@ ana are essential .
imagine how many opportunities to address the challenges facing children and families could be created , potentially reaching hundreds of thousands of children who are also inspired and encouraged to think critic@@ ally and resolve the problems affecting the world around them .
some argue that education is meaning@@ less if gradu@@ ates cannot find work ; in fact , job creation in afri@@ ca will be a major topic of discussion at the g@@ 20 summit .
but while investment in business development and job creation is crucial for economic vit@@ ality and growth , it won ’ t happen without an educated workforce .
a robust job market pre@@ sup@@ poses a sufficient number of skilled workers to fill available jobs .
but in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , only 58 % of children complete primary school .
this is why , when g@@ 20 leaders discuss new economic development strategies for afri@@ ca , they should focus on investment in education .
but , more important , they should seek to ensure that resources make it to those who rely on local leadership and innovation .
sustainable development goal 4 – to ensure equ@@ itable and inclusive education for all by 2030 – is at@@ tain@@ able , but only if solutions come from the ground up , which means from the afri@@ cans most committed to them .
why afri@@ ca needs fossil fuels
s@@ anti@@ ago – afri@@ ca is the world ’ s most “ renewable ” continent when it comes to energy .
in the rich world , renew@@ ables account for less than a tent@@ h of total energy supplies .
the 900 million people of sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca ( excluding south afri@@ ca ) get 80 % of their energy from renew@@ ables .
while a person in europ@@ e or north ameri@@ ca uses 1@@ 1,000 k@@ w@@ h per year on average ( much of it through industrial processes ) , a person in sub-@@ sah@@ ara afri@@ ca uses only 13@@ 7@@ k@@ w@@ h – less than a typical ameri@@ can refriger@@ ator uses in four months .
more than 600 million people in afri@@ ca have no access to electricity at all .
all this is not because afri@@ ca is green , but because it is poor .
some 2 % of the continent ’ s energy needs are met by hydro@@ -@@ electricity , and 78 % by humanity ’ s oldest “ renewable ” fuel : wood .
this leads to heavy de@@ fore@@ station and le@@ th@@ al indoor air pollution , which k@@ ills 1.3 million people each year .
but when us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama hosted a summit of afri@@ can leaders in 2014 , most said they wanted more fossil fuels .
in the words of tan@@ z@@ anian miner@@ als and energy minister so@@ sp@@ eter mu@@ hon@@ go : “ we will start intensi@@ fying the utili@@ zation of coal .... why sh@@ ouldn ’ t we use coal when there are other countries where their co@@ 2 per capita is so high ? .... we will just go ahead . ”
europ@@ e and north ameri@@ ca became rich thanks to cheap , pl@@ enti@@ ful power .
in 18@@ 00 , 94 % of all global energy came from renew@@ ables , almost all of it wood and plant material .
in 1900 , renew@@ ables provided 41 % of all energy ; even at the end of world war ii , renew@@ ables still provided 30 % of global energy .
since 1971 , the share of renew@@ ables has bot@@ tom@@ ed out , standing at around 13.@@ 5 % today .
almost all of this is wood , with just 0.5 % from solar and wind .
the international energy agency estimates that if all countries ful@@ fill the ple@@ dges made at the par@@ is climate change conference last month , the proportion of renew@@ ables could increase slightly in the next 25 years , to 18.@@ 7 % .
in the ie@@ a ’ s more likely scenario , the share will reach just 15.@@ 4 % .
most of that “ renewable ” energy will still come from crop resi@@ due , co@@ w man@@ ure , wood , and biofuels .
while a solar panel can provide energy for a light bul@@ b and a charge for a cell phone , it does little to help run sto@@ ves to avoid indoor air pollution or fri@@ dges to keep vacc@@ ines and food fresh , much less power agriculture and industry .
by 20@@ 40 , in the ie@@ a ’ s optimistic scenario , solar power in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca will produce 14@@ k@@ w@@ h per person per year , less than what is needed to keep a single two-@@ wat@@ t led permanently lit .
the ie@@ a also estimates that renewable power will still cost more , on average , than any other source – oil , gas , nuclear , coal , or hydr@@ o , even with a carbon tax .
few in the rich world would switch to renew@@ ables without heavy subsidies , and certainly no one would cut off their connection to the mostly fossi@@ l-@@ fu@@ el-@@ powered grid that provides stable power on cl@@ ou@@ dy days and at night ( another form of subsidy ) .
yet western activists seem to believe that the world ’ s wor@@ st-@@ off people should be satisfied with inadequate and ir@@ regular electricity supplies .
in its recent afri@@ ca energy outlook , the ie@@ a estimates that afri@@ ca ’ s energy consumption will increase by 80 % by 20@@ 40 ; but , with the continent ’ s population almost dou@@ bling , less energy per person will be available .
although nearly one billion additional people will gain access to electricity by 20@@ 40 , 5@@ 30 million will still be cut off .
but the ie@@ a out@@ lines another possible future – what it calls the “ afri@@ can century ” – in which afri@@ ca ’ s governments and donors invest an extra $ 450 billion in energy .
this would sharp@@ ly increase the use of fossil fuels , reduce much of the most poll@@ uting renew@@ ables , and provide energy access to 230 million more people .
providing more – and more reliable – power to almost two billion people will increase g@@ d@@ p by 30 % in 20@@ 40 .
each person on the continent will be almost $ 1,000 better off every year .
in western countries , environmental campaign@@ ers would focus on the down@@ side – 300 million tons of additional co ₂ emissions in 20@@ 40 , and higher outdoor air pollution from greater reli@@ ance on coal power – and ask why anyone would want to increase co ₂ and air pollution .
but let ’ s look at the costs and benefits .
the almost four billion extra tons of co ₂ emit@@ ted over the next 25 years would cause about $ 140 billion in damage from global warming , using the us official ( though , likely somewhat exag@@ ger@@ ated ) social cost figure .
the increase in coal use would lead to more air pollution , co@@ sting about $ 30 billion during this period .
at the same time , afri@@ ca would become almost $ 7 tril@@ lion ri@@ cher .
indoor air pollution would essentially be eliminated for about 150 million more people , with social benefits worth nearly $ 500 billion .
and power would reach 230 million extra people , generating benefits worth $ 1.2 tril@@ lion .
in other words , the total costs of the “ afri@@ can century , ” including cli@@ mat@@ e- and heal@@ th-@@ related costs , would amount to $ 170 billion .
the total benefits , at $ 8.@@ 4 tril@@ lion , would be almost 50 times higher .
the same general argument probably holds for indi@@ a and other developing countries .
in ch@@ ina , for example , co@@ 2 emissions have increased 500 % since 1981 ; but the country ’ s poverty rate pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed – from 89 % then to less than 10 % today .
in weal@@ thy countries , campaign@@ ers emphasize that a ton of co@@ 2 could cost some $ 50 and should be tax@@ ed to reduce emissions .
but for afri@@ ca , the economic , social , and environmental benefits of more energy and higher co@@ 2 run to more than $ 2@@ ,000 per ton .
focusing on the $ 50 in cost and ign@@ oring the $ 2@@ ,000 in benefits is will@@ ful blin@@ dness .
one day , innovation could drive down the price of future green energy to the point that it lifts people out of poverty more effectively than fossil fuels do .
globally , we should invest much more in such innovation . but global warming will not be fixed by hypo@@ critic@@ ally closing a path out of poverty to the world ’ s poor .
em@@ power@@ ing the other half of afri@@ ca ’ s economy
j@@ oh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg – ju@@ li@@ us ny@@ er@@ ere , the founding president of tan@@ z@@ ania , once said that “ unity ” will not make afri@@ ca rich , but “ it can make it difficult for afri@@ ca and the afri@@ can peoples to be dis@@ regarded and hum@@ ili@@ ated . ”
but , two decades later , afri@@ ca remains divided along a key fault line : gender .
to realize ny@@ er@@ ere ’ s vision of a strong , dig@@ ni@@ fied continent , afri@@ ca needs a new era of liber@@ ation , one that is fu@@ eled by the economic em@@ power@@ ment of the continent ’ s women .
although projec@@ tions by the consultan@@ cy m@@ ck@@ in@@ sey anticip@@ ate that by 20@@ 40 , afri@@ ca will have the world ’ s largest labor force , with more than 1.1 billion people of working age , more than 60 % of afri@@ ca ’ s current population still survive on less than $ 2 a day .
it is obvious that while many afri@@ cans have benefited from political eman@@ cip@@ ation – the legacy of ny@@ er@@ ere ’ s generation – poverty remains a significant obstacle .
un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing the employment potential of afri@@ can women is the best way to overcome it .
as it stands , afri@@ ca ’ s women continue to be under@@ represented in key industries and executive roles , owing to workplace discrimination and patri@@ arch@@ al expectations at home .
unless barriers to entering the formal economy are removed and women are presented with options that enable them to realize their full potential , afri@@ ca ’ s soci@@ o@@ economic development will continue to be impe@@ ded .
but while women are essential to the continent ’ s progress , they are still too often regarded as being secondary .
women must therefore claim their right to sit where decisions are made , and to shape the policies , plans , and strategies that will affect their lives and the lives of afri@@ cans for generations to come .
studies have shown that if more women had access to mal@@ e-@@ dominated occup@@ ations in afri@@ ca , worker productivity would rise by as much as 25 % .
that would be good for the overall economy , but also for women in general , as it would open up new a@@ venues for social em@@ power@@ ment .
when women participate in the job market and engage actively in business or political decision-making , patri@@ arch@@ al power dynam@@ ics shift , elev@@ ating the social status of women .
economic equality also challenges accepted belie@@ fs , and disp@@ els harmful my@@ ths that perpet@@ u@@ ate narrow definitions of gender norms .
in other words , bringing more women into the workplace leads to an eman@@ cip@@ ation of min@@ d@@ set – in men and women alike .
what ny@@ er@@ ere so el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently said of afri@@ ca as a whole is no less true for its women : unity is the key to re@@ alizing our potential .
when we come together as gener@@ ators of wealth , it becomes impossible for us to go un@@ recognized for our economic contributions and margin@@ alized in our entrepreneur@@ ial endeavo@@ urs .
at the gra@@ ça mach@@ el trust , we are joining together with civil@@ -@@ society actors , the private sector , and governments across the continent to lead a new economic liber@@ ation movement for women .
divided , we are weak , but together , afri@@ ca ’ s women have the ability to confront and overcome the barriers that have kept us from full participation in our respective economies .
there is power in networks .
my organization ’ s approach to economic adv@@ ancement is to establish and strengthen informal and official networks , through which women can , in time , increase their participation and visibility in key sectors .
that is why we are launching the “ women adv@@ ancing afri@@ ca ” initiative , which is part of our ongoing effort to amp@@ li@@ fy the voices of afri@@ ca ’ s under@@ represented and to establish a pan@@ -@@ afri@@ can women ’ s movement , in which women can come together to transform the continent .
the inaug@@ ural women adv@@ ancing afri@@ ca forum will take place this week in dar es sal@@ a@@ am , tan@@ z@@ ania , and will conven@@ e more than 250 women leaders from across the continent .
under the over@@ ar@@ ching theme of “ driving social and economic transformation , ” the forum will focus on three strategic goals : promoting financial inclusion , increasing market access , and driving social change .
we aim to emerge from the forum with a common agenda for our participation as full economic actors .
it has been just over 20 years since ny@@ er@@ ere encouraged us to work toward afri@@ can unity .
today , afri@@ ca ’ s women are helping to shape the policies and practices that will bring about economic and social liber@@ ation in their respective countries .
we have some way to go before afri@@ can unity is fully realized .
but enabling women to become full partners in afri@@ ca ’ s economic future , is among the best ways to ensure that we succeed .
afri@@ can mis@@ rule on trial
the ha@@ gue – as the world focuses on the inaug@@ ur@@ ation of ameri@@ ca ’ s first black president and celeb@@ rates an important milestone in the ongoing struggle for ra@@ cial equality , recent developments across the at@@ lan@@ tic represent significant progress in a related global campaign to end imp@@ unity for mass crimes .
in the coming days , judges sitting on the international criminal court in the ha@@ gue will decide whether to issue a warrant for the arrest of su@@ dan@@ ese president om@@ ar al-@@ b@@ ash@@ ir for the crime of genocide .
and on jan@@ u@@ ary 26 , the ic@@ c will begin its first trial – that of th@@ om@@ as lu@@ b@@ ang@@ a dy@@ il@@ o , a former con@@ gol@@ ese war@@ l@@ ord .
neither event is earth sh@@ at@@ tering , but , taken together , these two steps mean that a new system of international justice is working .
government and re@@ bel leaders around the globe have been put on notice that criminal conduct will no longer be given a free pass .
although the threatened indic@@ tment of al-@@ b@@ ash@@ ir has promp@@ ted protest in k@@ har@@ tou@@ m , no one expects him to appear in court soon .
as for lu@@ b@@ ang@@ a , he is one of many in the con@@ go who has used civilians as pa@@ wns in a war that has cost more than five million lives in the past decade .
though serious , the charges against him – recru@@ iting child soldiers – do not pre@@ tend to encomp@@ ass the range of abuses committed .
five years after the world ’ s first permanent criminal tri@@ bunal commen@@ ced operations , it has made its mark .
the ic@@ c has opened four active investigations , issued public charges against twelve people , and to date secured cu@@ sto@@ dy of four .
nonetheless , the court has come under fire for three alleged fail@@ ings .
first , some argue that by inter@@ jecting itself into ongoing conflicts , the ic@@ c has impe@@ ded efforts to secure peace .
but the facts on the ground do not bear this out .
in northern ug@@ anda , ic@@ c charges against leaders of the re@@ bel l@@ ord ’ s resistance army have helped bring an end to years of brutal fighting , and margin@@ alized the l@@ ra ’ s chief , jo@@ se@@ ph kon@@ y .
simil@@ arly , in su@@ dan ’ s dar@@ fur region , there has been no genuine peace process to dis@@ rupt , as attacks on civilians continue to be reported , even after the united nations security council referred the matter to the ic@@ c in 2005 .
even so , the ic@@ c prosec@@ utor ’ s application for an arrest warrant for al-@@ b@@ ash@@ ir – announced this past ju@@ ly – has yet to provo@@ ke a wi@@ del@@ y-@@ fe@@ ared cra@@ ck@@ down on humanitarian organizations .
on the contrary , it may have promp@@ ted the arrest of a lower@@ -@@ level indic@@ tee for crimes in dar@@ fur .
in short , more law , rather than less , is needed to help stem the violence .
second , the ic@@ c is said to have allowed itself to become a tool of national political leaders .
the fact that national governments referred three of the court ’ s four active cases – and that in each of those cases only armed re@@ bels or government opponents have been charged so far – has contributed to this perception .
navig@@ ating this inter@@ play between law and politics is perhaps the ic@@ c ’ s greatest challenge .
on the one hand , the court ’ s actions often have political consequences : however well-@@ founded , acc@@ using the leader of a re@@ bel army may be seen as taking sides in a conflict .
on the other hand , the court cannot charge – or refrain from charging – a senior political or military official responsible for grave crimes solely to aver@@ t negative political repercussions .
nor would it be proper , where the grav@@ ity and scale of crimes materi@@ ally differ , to charge all sides in a conflict in order to preserve a false sense of par@@ ity .
both of these complaints reflect a third : un@@ ease with the court ’ s overwhelming focus on afri@@ ca .
some suggest that this is yet another example of western institutions applying to afri@@ ca principles that they don ’ t apply to themselves .
the long history of afri@@ ca ’ s exploitation demands that this concern not be dis@@ missed out of hand .
nevertheless , afri@@ ca is the site of many of the world ’ s worst conflicts .
nor is the ic@@ c a foreign body .
thirty afri@@ can governments have ratified the ic@@ c ’ s governing statute , and several of the court ’ s 18 judges ha@@ il from afri@@ ca , as does a substantial portion of its staff .
still , the court should not hesitate to act outside afri@@ ca when mass atro@@ cities demand red@@ ress .
the experience of other war crimes tri@@ bun@@ als suggests that questions about political bi@@ as may take years to overcome .
only by demonstrating profession@@ alism in its work , and willingness to hold senior government figures accountable where appropriate , can the ic@@ c en@@ gender broad and lasting support .
over time , the ic@@ c ’ s example should foster more effective national and regional prosec@@ utions of serious crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , and war crimes .
for now , the court can best address skep@@ tics by more regularly and transpar@@ ently expla@@ ining itself – its decisions , its mandate , and its constraints – to a global public to whom it ultimately must answer .
afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms in the islam@@ ic world
ni@@ geri@@ a has been conv@@ ul@@ sed by religious violence triggered by the car@@ to@@ ons of the pro@@ ph@@ et mu@@ ham@@ mad published in a dan@@ ish newspaper months ago .
the violence began in the northern ni@@ geri@@ an city of ma@@ i@@ du@@ g@@ ur@@ i during a protest by mus@@ li@@ ms against the car@@ to@@ ons , with the ch@@ ris@@ tian association of ni@@ geri@@ a reporting at least 50 ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans killed .
re@@ pris@@ als were swift , and at least 50 mus@@ li@@ ms were killed in three days of violence in the sou@@ the@@ astern ( predomin@@ antly ch@@ ris@@ tian ) cities of on@@ it@@ sh@@ a and en@@ ug@@ u .
the ni@@ geri@@ an protests against the car@@ to@@ ons ( so far the most violent in afri@@ ca ) raise the question : what is the role and position of afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms ( or more accurately , sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms ) in the “ islam@@ ic world ” ?
when people in the rest of the world use the term “ islam@@ ic world ” do they include in it sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms , or do they have in mind only the mus@@ li@@ ms of the middle east and a@@ sia ?
mus@@ li@@ ms in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca do not share many characteristics with mus@@ li@@ ms in other parts of the world , especially those of the ar@@ ab world .
sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms are less asser@@ tive , and they face considerably more difficulties in their attempts to articul@@ ate their rights and establish their presence in their respective states and regions .
part of the difficulty arises from the perpet@@ ual afri@@ can di@@ lemma of identity .
afri@@ ca has been described as a continent having a tri@@ ple heritage , and the afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ m , too , has a split personality .
he must decide whether he is a mus@@ li@@ m first , then a member of his tri@@ be , say , haus@@ a , and then of his nation , say , ni@@ geri@@ a .
even though mus@@ li@@ m practice is strong in afri@@ ca , there is widespread incorpor@@ ation of traditional afri@@ can rit@@ u@@ als in cerem@@ on@@ ies like we@@ d@@ dings and fun@@ er@@ als .
for example , among the lu@@ hy@@ a in western ken@@ ya , it is not un@@ common for mus@@ li@@ ms to slau@@ ghter animals during fun@@ er@@ als , even though , strictly speaking , there is no such provision in is@@ lam .
mus@@ li@@ ms in many sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can states are also minorities .
they do not form a form@@ id@@ able presence , as in ni@@ geri@@ a , where some muslim@@ -@@ majority states in the north have even implemented sh@@ aria law , making them more or less islam@@ ic states .
nevertheless , the federal re@@ public of ni@@ geri@@ a is a sec@@ ular state , as are almost all sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can states .
the colonial legacy also helps account for the relatively do@@ ci@@ le nature of mus@@ li@@ ms in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca .
the colonial powers ’ arbitrary de@@ mar@@ cation of borders l@@ um@@ ped together in one state diverse ethnic groups which may have been historical ant@@ agon@@ ists .
colonial political economy also concentrated “ development ” in re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ rich areas , while neglec@@ ting re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ poor regions and their populations , which in many cases were mus@@ li@@ m .
thus we see a relatively poor haus@@ a-@@ mus@@ li@@ m majority population in northern ni@@ geri@@ a and a relatively rich i@@ bo@@ -@@ ch@@ ris@@ tian majority population in o@@ il-@@ rich sou@@ the@@ astern ni@@ geri@@ a ; a relatively rich ch@@ ris@@ tian majority population in central ken@@ ya and a relatively poor mus@@ li@@ m majority population on the coast and in the nor@@ the@@ astern provin@@ ces ; and so on .
as political power tends to pol@@ ari@@ ze around economic power , sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms have been under-@@ represented in these mostly centr@@ alized political systems .
moreover , mus@@ li@@ ms in these mostly pat@@ ron@@ -@@ client states have been forced to identify more with atom@@ istic / par@@ o@@ chi@@ al ethnic nation@@ alism in order to enjoy the “ fruits of independence ” and thus acquire whatever political representation they have .
this has led to a related problem in countries bor@@ dering the indi@@ an ocean : dis@@ unity between coastal , more arab@@ ized mus@@ li@@ ms and the non-@@ arab@@ ized mus@@ li@@ ms of the interior .
it is no exag@@ ger@@ ation to argue that the more arab@@ ized afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms along the ken@@ yan and tan@@ z@@ anian co@@ asts ( including the island of z@@ an@@ zi@@ bar ) consider themselves “ more mus@@ li@@ m ” than the less arab@@ ized mus@@ li@@ ms inland .
mus@@ li@@ m political participation in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca has thus been extremely limited .
political is@@ lam is an almost unknown phenomenon in this region ( the islam@@ ic party of ken@@ ya was never registered , for example ) , and mus@@ li@@ m organizations have mostly focused on welfare and rights .
however , mus@@ li@@ ms in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , like most mus@@ li@@ ms around the world , ex@@ hibit an “ us ver@@ sus them ” ment@@ ality .
when mus@@ li@@ ms form a minority , they have ten@@ ded to co-@@ exist peac@@ efully with other religi@@ ons , but where their populations are substantial ( as in ni@@ geri@@ a ) , they tend to asser@@ t themselves .
whatever ethnic and other divisions are at stake , the “ us ver@@ sus them ” sen@@ timent has played a large role in f@@ om@@ enting religious conflict in ni@@ geri@@ a .
nevertheless , ni@@ geri@@ a ( and perhaps z@@ an@@ zi@@ bar ) remains an exception in islam@@ ic asser@@ tiveness in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , which is why the idea of an active “ islam@@ ic world ” includes only a relatively limited segment of sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms .
whether they like it or not , the majority of sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can mus@@ li@@ ms are represented by states that are mostly sec@@ ular , ch@@ ris@@ tian , or dominated by other religi@@ ons .
cap@@ itali@@ zing on afri@@ ca ’ s youth divi@@ dend
tor@@ onto – when south afri@@ can university students took to the streets in 2016 as part of the “ fees must fall ” protest movement , the “ dec@@ ol@@ on@@ ization of the cur@@ ricul@@ um ” was among the movement ’ s chief concerns .
it was a pi@@ vo@@ tal moment in south afri@@ ca ’ s history , as young people rose to demand quality and accessible education .
but a crucial question was missing from the debate over fees and cur@@ ri@@ cular relevance : how can changes to higher education em@@ power afri@@ ca ’ s youth to drive the continent ’ s economic transformation ?
for afri@@ ca , the question is no longer “ if ” students are taught , but “ what . ”
unfortunately , while access to education has improved significantly in recent decades , school cur@@ ricul@@ a have changed little since the colonial era , when secondary education was an elite privi@@ lege designed to advance the care@@ ers of a select few .
technical and vocational education and training ( t@@ v@@ et ) programs have also suffered from neg@@ le@@ ct .
today , these initiatives are marked by out@@ dated courses and rote learning methods that fail to prepare young people for the demands of the twenty-@@ first-@@ century job market .
the trouble goes beyond traditional components of the cur@@ ricul@@ um , like math , science , and language .
there is also a defici@@ ency in critical “ soft ” skills , such as communication , te@@ am@@ work , and problem solving .
though neglec@@ ted , it is these skills that enable young people to become adap@@ table , lifelong lear@@ ners .
the master@@ y of soft skills cor@@ relates to improved outcomes in school , work , and life .
yet , until recently , training in soft skills has not been integrated into formal education systems on the continent .
fortunately , that is changing .
across the continent , secondary schools and t@@ v@@ et systems are trans@@ forming themselves to prepare afri@@ ca ’ s young minds with the skills they need to make the transition from school to employment , and to become more engaged citizens .
these adjustments are coming at a critical time for afri@@ ca , where many countries are experiencing a demographic divi@@ dend of declining fertil@@ ity rates and rising productivity .
in particular , these changes mean more opportunity for young people as they prepare to enter the job market .
but to succeed on the job , young people must have the skills and education that a modern economy requires .
at the master@@ card foundation , where i manage education and learning programs , we ’ ve put together a blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int – called skills at scale – to help afri@@ can educ@@ ators rev@@ itali@@ ze their cur@@ ricul@@ a to cap@@ itali@@ ze more effectively on the economic potential of youth .
one of the continent ’ s most successful efforts already underway is the us@@ ai@@ d-@@ funded ak@@ az@@ i kan@@ o@@ ze youth live@@ li@@ hoods project , designed by the education development center ( ed@@ c ) in bo@@ ston .
ak@@ az@@ i kan@@ o@@ ze ep@@ it@@ om@@ iz@@ es how a small initiative can cataly@@ ze wider educ@@ ation-@@ sector reform , by empha@@ si@@ zing links to local employers that provide access to entr@@ y-@@ level jobs , intern@@ ships , and apprenti@@ ces@@ hi@@ ps .
the focus on personal development , inter@@ personal communication , and leadership training has ensured that students are well equipped to enter the labor market upon gradu@@ ation .
r@@ wand@@ a ’ s ministr@@ y of education has already moved to integrate elements of the program in t@@ ve@@ ts across the country .
the government recently integrated ak@@ az@@ i kan@@ o@@ ze ’ s approach in the national cur@@ ricul@@ um to equi@@ p secondary and t@@ v@@ et students with the soft skills they require to succeed .
national exam@@ s in the 201@@ 8-@@ 201@@ 9 academic year will also reflect the new compet@@ enc@@ y-@@ based cur@@ ricul@@ um .
since 2009 , ak@@ az@@ i kan@@ o@@ ze train@@ ings have prepared more than 37@@ ,000 youth for work , with more than 65 % of participants in the initial round of training employed six months after gradu@@ ation .
based on the success of integrating soft skills into the cur@@ ricul@@ um in r@@ wand@@ a , the master@@ card foundation and ed@@ c will launch a similar program in sen@@ egal later this year .
change is not without challenge .
adapting models of skills training to v@@ ast@@ ly different education systems across afri@@ ca will take time .
it will also be difficult to ensure that intensive training models reach all young people , including those no longer in school .
experience in r@@ wand@@ a shows that cur@@ ricul@@ um re@@ design requires close cooperation with education and workforce development authorities , as well as government officials , teachers , and school administr@@ ators .
new cur@@ ricul@@ um content also requires developing new teaching and learning materials .
achieving scale also requires a mark@@ edly different approach to training teachers than is currently on offer in most afri@@ can school systems .
train@@ ings must go beyond traditional , one-@@ off approaches , by providing ongoing teacher support .
new ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ es also require contin@@ ual supervision and practice , especially early on .
the old “ cas@@ c@@ ade ” model of teacher training simply won ’ t work .
afri@@ can governments , with support from the international community , can help students ’ transition from school to work by rel@@ ying on a cur@@ ricul@@ um that elev@@ ates the importance of soft skills .
if done well , these changes can ensure young people are positioned to drive afri@@ ca ’ s future prosperity .
afri@@ cans deserve a forwar@@ d-@@ looking education system , not one that remains stu@@ ck in the past .
as students in south afri@@ ca demonstrated last year , the continent ’ s youth will settle for nothing less .
a big bond for afri@@ ca
la@@ gos – the countries of sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca have reached a critical jun@@ c@@ ture .
stra@@ ined by a collapse in commodity prices and ch@@ ina ’ s economic slow@@ down , the region ’ s growth sli@@ pped to 3.@@ 4 % in 2015 – nearly 50 % lower than the average rate over the previous 15 years .
the estimated growth rate for 2016 is lower than the population growth rate of about 2 % , im@@ plying a per capita contra@@ ction in g@@ d@@ p .
sustained economic growth is essential to maintain progress on reducing poverty , inf@@ ant mortality , disease , and mal@@ nutrition .
it is also the only way to create sufficient good jobs for afri@@ ca ’ s bur@@ ge@@ oning youth population – the fastest growing in the world .
as ger@@ d m@@ üller , ger@@ many ’ s development minister , noted at a recent press conference , “ if the youth of afri@@ ca can ’ t find work or a future in their own countries , it won ’ t be hundreds of thousands , but millions that make their way to europ@@ e . ”
one way to sustain growth and create jobs would be to collabor@@ ate on planning and implementing a massive increase in infrastructure investment across afri@@ ca .
public infrastructure is particularly important .
this includes high@@ ways , bridges , and railways linking rural producers in land@@ locked countries to afri@@ ca ’ s urban consumers and external markets ; mass transit and internet infrastructure to accommodate greater commercial activity ; and electricity transmission lines integrating priv@@ ately financed power plants and gri@@ ds .
major regional projects are also needed to kn@@ it together sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca ’ s many tiny economies .
this is the only way to create the economies of scale needed to increase the export potential of afri@@ can agriculture and industry , as well as to reduce domestic prices of food and manufactured goods .
while governments in afri@@ ca are spending more on public infrastructure themselves , outside finance is still required , especially for regional projects , which are rarely a top priority for national governments .
yet aid from afri@@ ca ’ s traditionally generous foreign donors , including the united states and europ@@ e , is now set to shr@@ ink , owing to political and economic constraints .
but there may be a solution that helps afri@@ ca recover its growth in a way that western leaders and their constitu@@ ents find acceptable .
we call it the “ big bond ” – a strategy for le@@ ver@@ aging foreign aid funds in international capital markets to generate financing for massive infrastructure investment .
specifically , donors would bor@@ row against future aid flows in capital markets .
that way , they could exploit current low interest rates at home , as they generate new resources .
with 30-@@ year us treas@@ ury rates of about 3 % , donors would have to sec@@ uri@@ ti@@ ze only about $ 5 billion to raise $ 100 billion .
that money could come from the $ 35 billion in annual official development assistance ( o@@ da ) to afri@@ ca ( which tot@@ als about $ 50 billion ) that takes the form of pure grants .
donors would pass on the interest cost to afri@@ can countries , reducing their own fiscal costs .
for afri@@ can countries , the terms would be better than those provided by euro@@ bonds .
in fact , as au@@ d@@ ac@@ ious as it may sound , passing on the interest costs to recipient countries could actually bol@@ ster their debt sustainability .
according to a study of eight countries by the afri@@ can development bank ’ s policy innovation la@@ b , a 3 % interest rate in us dollar terms would be lower than the margin@@ al cost of commercial borro@@ w@@ ings undertaken by several afri@@ can countries over the last five years .
moreover , far longer mat@@ urities and grace periods , compared to market finance , would ease growing pressure on foreign@@ -@@ exchange reserves .
big bond resources , managed by the afri@@ can development bank , could be used to help guarantee financing for major regional infrastructure projects that have long been stu@@ ck on the back bur@@ ner , such as the east afri@@ ca railway connecting tan@@ z@@ ania , r@@ wand@@ a , and bur@@ undi , and a highway stret@@ ching from ni@@ geri@@ a to c@@ ô@@ te d ’ i@@ vo@@ ire .
such projects could also be co-@@ financed by private investors .
moreover , the big bond could help to rein@@ vigor@@ ate the relationship between donors and afri@@ can countries .
and , as it supports investments with important countr@@ y-@@ level benefits , it could serve as an incentive for afri@@ can countries to pursue reforms that increase their absor@@ p@@ tive capacity , in terms of choosing and exec@@ uting public infrastructure investments .
the big bond approach represents a mu@@ ch-@@ needed update to the o@@ da framework – one that supports higher and more sustainable growth in recipient countries , while lower@@ ing the burden on donor countries .
at a time when aid is under political pressure , perhaps such a bold approach to maxim@@ izing the efficiency of donor resources is exactly what the world needs .
power@@ ing afri@@ ca ’ s transformation
cape town / la@@ gos – afri@@ ca has a bright future ahead of it .
productivity and growth will improve as afri@@ can economies continue to place more emphasis on services and manufacturing , pursue commodity production , and achieve quick gains in agriculture and light industry .
but afri@@ can countries ’ success pre@@ sup@@ poses that they generate and manage energy sustain@@ ably to keep up with increasing demand .
in the next 35 years , afri@@ ca ’ s population will continue to rise , with a projected 800 million people across the continent moving to cities .
and afri@@ cans are already dis@@ proportion@@ ately exposed to the adverse effects of climate change , even though they are collecti@@ vely responsible for less than 4 % of global greenh@@ ou@@ se-@@ gas emissions .
urban areas will have to reduce environmental stresses by promoting low-@@ carbon energy systems , electric mass transportation , and energy-@@ efficiency initiatives , as well as the use of clean@@ er cooking fuels .
and rural areas can create new opportunities that reduce the need for urban migration , by expanding renewable energy systems and energy access .
but even with these measures , providing enough energy for a modern , inclusive economy will not be easy .
afri@@ ca already experiences frequent power out@@ ages , even though more than 600 million people there do not have access to electricity , and current demand is relatively modest .
to avoid the harmful sp@@ il@@ lo@@ ver effects of high-@@ carbon economic growth , afri@@ ca will have to under@@ go a “ climate smart ” energy revolution .
afri@@ can countries will need to build cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ re@@ sili@@ ent infrastructure and tap into the continent ’ s abund@@ ant renew@@ ab@@ le-@@ energy resources .
doing so will bro@@ aden access to energy , create green jobs , reduce environmental pollution , and enhance energy security by diversi@@ fying sources .
for example , as rain@@ fall becomes more er@@ ratic , hydro@@ power production and revenues may decline .
this risk can be managed by modi@@ fying existing investment plans to account for large climate sw@@ ings .
still , for the region to adapt , the united nations environment programme estimates that it will need annual investments of about $ 7-@@ 15 billion by 2020 , and $ 50 billion by 2050 .
rather than treating new cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ related risks as hur@@ d@@ les to overcome , we should view them as opportunities for investment and innovation .
we are standing on the threshold of an exciting new era in which technological progress allows us to use a range of conventional and un@@ conventional energy options ( excluding nuclear energy ) .
afri@@ can countries can now combine energy sources to adapt to realities on the ground .
unlike in past decades , they no longer need be tied to a single energy source .
and , because much of afri@@ ca ’ s energy infrastructure remains to be built , governments have a chance to get their energy and infrastructure policies right the first time , thereby maxim@@ izing returns on investment .
policymakers should take a few key steps to help transform afri@@ ca ’ s energy sector and boost long-term economic growth . for star@@ ters , making it easier , safer , and more financially attractive for private investors to enter power markets would boost competition , thereby sp@@ urr@@ ing innovation and lower@@ ing costs .
another important step is to invest in renewable energy .
afri@@ ca has an exceptionally rich portfolio of cle@@ an-@@ energy assets , including almost nine ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of solar capacity , more than 350 gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of hydro@@ power capacity , and more than 100 g@@ w of win@@ d-@@ power potential .
this is more than enough to meet the continent ’ s future demand .
for example , the price of uti@@ lit@@ y-@@ scale photo@@ volta@@ ic solar energy in afri@@ ca fell by 50 % between 2010 and 2014 , and continues to decrease today .
and south afri@@ ca ’ s renewable energy independent power producer procurement programme has seen an overall decline in bid prices and over@@ subscription rates .
innovative off-@@ grid and mini-@@ grid electri@@ c@@ ity-@@ distribution systems , mean@@ while , are already trans@@ forming afri@@ ca ’ s energy landscape and multi@@ plying the ways to exploit cle@@ an-@@ energy sources and expand electricity access for the poor , particularly in areas where consumers are widely dis@@ per@@ sed .
companies such as m-@@ kop@@ a and mo@@ bis@@ ol have made small sol@@ ar-@@ energy systems available to thousands of afri@@ can homes , by allowing their customers to pay in install@@ ments on their mobile devices .
still , to accelerate a market shift on the scale that afri@@ ca needs will require increased financing from export credit agencies , development banks , commercial financial institutions , and other cross-border sources .
afri@@ ca has a chance to bring hundreds of millions of people without electricity into the modern economy ; and we have an opportunity to pione@@ er the next investment frontier .
getting afri@@ ca ’ s energy transformation right , by pursuing a mix of policies and investments that boost diversity and strengthen re@@ sili@@ ence , will ensure a bri@@ ghter future for us all .
acceler@@ ating afri@@ ca ’ s energy transition
par@@ is – for much of afri@@ ca , the transition from fossil fuels to clean@@ er forms of energy is seen as an environmental imperative .
with fossil fuels comprising a majority – as high as 70 % in some cases – of the energy mix , the situation on the continent is indeed ec@@ ologically di@@ re .
but afri@@ ca ’ s energy transition is economically urgent as well .
each year , oil subsidies consu@@ me 1.5 % of the continent ’ s g@@ d@@ p – roughly $ 50 billion .
that is enough money to provide solar power to some 300 million people .
if the continent could re@@ balance its energy portfolio , moving away from hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons slowly , those subsidies could be real@@ located in ways that would yield both environmental and economic benefits .
today , neither oil expor@@ ters nor impor@@ ters are adequately insul@@ ated from price sho@@ cks .
when oil prices declined rapidly in 2015 , for example , afri@@ ca ’ s energy impor@@ ters spent less on oil , while exporting countries suffered financially .
when prices re@@ bo@@ unded , the relationship swit@@ ched : energy-@@ exporting countries ’ revenues in@@ ched up , while im@@ porting countries strug@@ gl@@ ed to maintain consumption levels .
this is a need@@ less cycle .
integrating clean@@ er power into national energy systems would not only raise local capacities ; it would also free up hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons for export .
the resulting revenue could then be invested into new forms of gre@@ ener power .
such a transition , which would require cooperation with the oil sector , promises to boost soci@@ o@@ economic progress .
among the biggest benefits would be the electri@@ fication of areas that , under current distribution systems , are literally in the dark .
today , just 30 % of afri@@ ca has access to reliable electricity .
but , with a total capacity estimated at around ten ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts , installed solar capacity in afri@@ ca could bro@@ aden access dramatically .
in fact , according to some estimates , the increase in solar generation by 2030 could range from 15 to 62 gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts .
fossil fuels are not dest@@ ined to be ph@@ ased out any@@ time soon , but an energy mix that included a significant increase in solar power would have major economic advantages for afri@@ ca , especially in areas where agriculture is the largest economic sector .
electri@@ fying agricultural areas would facilitate the storage and transportation of far@@ med products , improve food security , and increase farmers ’ ear@@ ning capacity .
in the drive to re@@ balance afri@@ ca ’ s energy mix , the continent maintains one crucial advantage over developed economies : a clean s@@ late .
the relative absence of legacy investments is the principal reason why green power is afri@@ ca ’ s best energy option .
although every country must balance its own energy needs , reli@@ ance on renewable sources , and solar power in particular , is the most cost-@@ efficient strategy for fostering rapid economic development throughout the continent .
evidence of this potential can be found in the few photo@@ volta@@ ic power plants that have begun operating in afri@@ ca .
for example , the sen@@ ergy 2 solar plant in sen@@ egal s@@ ells electricity to the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese power utility at a price that lo@@ wers the cost of the energy mix by 50 % .
similar solar solutions are being implemented by afri@@ can telecoms to electri@@ fy communication to@@ wers .
the best way to accelerate the transition from hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons to gre@@ ener forms of energy would be to re@@ direct a portion of national oil subsidies to renew@@ ables .
this would create stronger incentives to reduce fossi@@ l-@@ fuel consumption , while encouraging investment and growth in gre@@ en-@@ energy output .
for afri@@ ca ’ s rural regions , moreover , such policies would help bring communities out of dark@@ ness and lead to the installation of other critical infrastructure that economic growth requires .
but while renew@@ ables hold the key to afri@@ ca ’ s long-term prosperity , the continent ’ s transition to clean@@ er power should not lead to an immediate , full-@@ scale re@@ pu@@ di@@ ation of hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons . the oil sector will still have an important role to play .
the industry ’ s experience on the continent will be needed to navig@@ ate the energy transformation .
and , because fossil fuels will remain part of the continent ’ s energy mix , the oil sector must be encouraged to clean up its own act .
this may sound like an impossible alliance .
but as policymakers across the continent seek to secure adequate supplies of clean energy to ensure rapid , inclusive economic growth and environmental sustainability , they are likely to find that there is no alternative .
cooperation between old and new energy industries may be the only engine that is capable of power@@ ing afri@@ ca forward .
bo@@ ston – in f@@ ebru@@ ary in addi@@ s ab@@ aba , afri@@ can health ministers signed a widely celebrated declaration of their commitment to keeping imm@@ uni@@ zation at the fore@@ front of efforts to save the continent ’ s children from death and disease .
fulfilling that commitment will be no easy fe@@ at .
imm@@ uni@@ zation is not just a health issue ; it is also an economic challenge .
the case for vaccination is strong .
globally , an estimated 2-@@ 3 million child deaths and 600@@ ,000 adult deaths are prevented annually through imm@@ uni@@ zation .
moreover , imm@@ uni@@ zation is considered one of the most cost-effective public-@@ health interventions for reducing child mor@@ bi@@ dity , mortality , and disability .
a recent study estimates that every dollar spent on vaccination will save $ 16 in costs of ill@@ nesses aver@@ ted .
accounting for the value individuals place on longer and health@@ ier lives , net returns on investments in imm@@ uni@@ zation so@@ ar to some 44 times the cost .
and net returns exceed costs for all vacc@@ ines .
significant progress has been made .
in 2014 , 86 % of children were imm@@ uni@@ zed against di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , te@@ tan@@ us , and per@@ t@@ us@@ sis , compared to less than 5 % in 1974 .
and there have been extraordinary advances in the number and kinds of vacc@@ ines that are available .
yet , worldwide , an estimated 18.@@ 7 million inf@@ ants are not being reached by routine imm@@ uni@@ zation services .
the problem , of course , is access .
more than 60 % of the non-@@ imm@@ uni@@ zed inf@@ ants live in just ten countries : the democratic re@@ public of the con@@ go ( dr@@ c ) , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , indi@@ a , in@@ don@@ esia , i@@ ra@@ q , ni@@ geri@@ a , pak@@ istan , p@@ hili@@ pp@@ ines , ug@@ anda , and south afri@@ ca .
routine imm@@ uni@@ zation coverage remains particularly low in afri@@ ca ; indeed , it has stag@@ n@@ ated over the last three years , against a backdrop of weak and under-@@ re@@ sour@@ ced health systems .
as a result , one in five afri@@ can children still do not receive li@@ fes@@ aving vaccination .
in 2014 , an estimated 42 % of all global deaths from meas@@ les were in afri@@ ca .
most of afri@@ ca ’ s under-@@ imm@@ uni@@ zed children live in ni@@ geri@@ a , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , the dr@@ c , south su@@ dan , and gu@@ ine@@ a .
poor people , those living in rural areas , and families with lower education levels comp@@ rise the majority of those who are not reached .
clearly , money is a leading factor shaping imm@@ uni@@ zation outcomes . beyond in@@ adequately financed health systems , which remain weak and in@@ efficient , especially in rural areas , afri@@ can countries face challenges in aff@@ ording new , more expensive vacc@@ ines .
new vacc@@ ines should be enabling us to save more lives .
yet mé@@ dec@@ ins s@@ ans fron@@ ti@@ ères estimates that the introduction of new vacc@@ ines made it 68 times more expensive to vacc@@ in@@ ate a child in 2014 than in 2001 in most afri@@ can countries .
another study showed that in 2001 , the total cost of the original set of six world health organiz@@ ation-@@ recommended vacc@@ ines was less than one dollar .
in 2014 , the number of wh@@ o-@@ recommended vacc@@ ines had risen to 11 – and the cost had reached about $ 21 for boys and $ 35 for girls .
the added costs of delivery , currently estimated at about $ 25 per child , bring the total cost of fully imm@@ uni@@ zing a child today to $ 5@@ 0-@@ 60 .
that same study found that , in many low@@ - and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries , imm@@ uni@@ zation budgets are currently insufficient to sustain vaccination programs , much less incorporate the new co@@ st@@ lier vacc@@ ines .
as several health ministers pointed out in addi@@ s ab@@ aba , high vacc@@ ine prices force poor countries ’ governments to make tough choices about which dead@@ ly diseases they can afford to prevent .
for some countries , the situation is about to get worse , as g@@ av@@ i , the international group which has helped to finance the dramatic global expansion of new vacc@@ ines , phases out support for countries deemed to have “ gradu@@ ated ” from assistance .
without eli@@ gi@@ bility for the lower prices obtained by g@@ av@@ i , many of these countries may not be able to afford ne@@ wer vacc@@ ines .
in order to cope with this challenge , afri@@ can political leaders have committed to invest in the continent ’ s capacity to develop and produce its own vacc@@ ines .
but this is a long-term strategy that will require coordinated regional investment planning , market development , and stronger regulatory capabilities .
in the short to medium term , afri@@ can countries would do well to look into the power of collective bar@@ gaining to strike better deals for needed vacc@@ ines .
while afri@@ ca can and should do more to improve vaccination , the global community also has a responsibility to make a concer@@ ted effort to bring down vacc@@ ine costs .
the recently announced reduction in the price of p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ c@@ cal vacc@@ ine is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .
without collective action , equ@@ itable and sustained access to imm@@ uni@@ zation in afri@@ ca will remain a major problem – and children ’ s lives will continue to be lost .
new y@@ or@@ k – at ug@@ anda ’ s largest aids clin@@ ic , i recently witnessed a remarkable celebration of life .
the perform@@ ers were a tro@@ up@@ e of young afri@@ can sin@@ gers , dru@@ mm@@ ers and dan@@ c@@ ers , ranging in age from roughly eight to 28 .
rarely have i been so pro@@ found@@ ly moved .
“ this is a land , ” they s@@ ang ,
“ where beautiful people
lau@@ gh and dance in harmony .
afri@@ ca .
o afri@@ ca . ”
and , indeed , these young people lau@@ gh@@ ed and dan@@ ced not only in harmony but with a jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre that lit up their faces and filled us all with happ@@ iness .
listening , it was hard to imagine that they could easily be dead – and would be , if not for this clin@@ ic .
each of those splendid perform@@ ers is living with hi@@ v .
some arrived at the clin@@ ic so ill that they could scar@@ c@@ ely walk .
others showed few symptoms but , having tested positive , came to be treated .
they were mothers and fa@@ thers , s@@ isters and bro@@ thers , children and grand@@ parents .
all were alive and healthy for one reason only : the joint clinical research center in kamp@@ ala , and the drugs that it provides them .
ug@@ anda was the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the aids epide@@ mic .
there the s@@ cour@@ ge began in ear@@ n@@ est ; there ( as elsewhere in afri@@ ca ) it ex@@ acts its highest toll .
yet ug@@ anda is also a success story .
a decade ago , fewer than 10,000 people were taking the new generation of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs that sup@@ press the disease and offer the promise of a normal life .
today , that figure is 200@@ ,000 , thanks in large measure to generous support from the united states ( under its p@@ ep@@ far program ) and the global fund in gen@@ eva .
we have seen simil@@ arly encouraging progress elsewhere .
bo@@ ts@@ wan@@ a , among others , has invested heavily to offer universal treatment , and now is well on its way to ensuring that no baby is born with hi@@ v – a reality in developed countries , but not so in afri@@ ca , where 400@@ ,000 children are born with the disease each year .
south afri@@ ca , with the largest number of people living with hi@@ v , has spent nearly $ 1 billion over the past year in an ambitious coun@@ sel@@ ing and testing campaign to roll back the epide@@ mic .
but there is a new and growing danger that these advances might not be sustained .
p@@ eter mu@@ gy@@ en@@ y@@ i , who runs the joint clinical research center , told me that part of the problem is the she@@ er weight of numbers .
in ug@@ anda , only about half of those with hi@@ v / aids are being treated .
mean@@ while , money for treatment is dr@@ ying up .
because of the global recession , some international donors are threatening to cap their financial support .
countries such as mal@@ aw@@ i , zim@@ babwe , and ken@@ ya , as well as ug@@ anda , are requesting assistance for emergency drug supplies .
in kamp@@ ala , dr@@ . mu@@ gy@@ en@@ y@@ i has begun placing new patients on a waiting list .
as many as seven million afri@@ cans who should be getting treatment for hi@@ v are not .
worldwide , the number is about 10 million .
compo@@ unding the problem : donors have also been shi@@ fting their focus from aids to other diseases , because there is a sense that more lives can be saved more che@@ ap@@ ly .
at a time when we should be sc@@ aling up to meet the aids challenge , we are di@@ aling back .
in our global war on aids , the international community is on the ver@@ ge of s@@ nat@@ ching defeat from the ja@@ ws of victory .
those who r@@ al@@ lied to the fight are al@@ armed .
they fear that the impressive gains of the last decade will be lost . “ we are sitting on a time bom@@ b , ” dr@@ . mu@@ gy@@ en@@ y@@ i told me .
every day , he is forced into moral choices that no one should have to make .
how do you choose to treat a young girl but not her little brother ?
how do you turn away a pregn@@ ant mother , sitting with her children , cr@@ ying for help ?
surely we can do better .
in kamp@@ ala , i promised my young friends that i would do everything i could to help .
in wash@@ ington recently , the united nations rolled out an action plan that should dramatically accelerate progress on mat@@ ern@@ al and child health , including hi@@ v .
at the international aids conference in vi@@ enn@@ a , in ju@@ ly , i hope that the international community will r@@ ally around un@@ aids ’ launch of treatment 2.0 — the next generation of hi@@ v treatment , which must be more affordable , more effective , and accessible to all .
as chair of this year ’ s re@@ plen@@ ishment of the global fund , i urge all donors to see to it that countries such as ug@@ anda get the support they need , so that dr@@ . mu@@ gy@@ en@@ y@@ i and other fron@@ t-@@ line soldiers in the fight against aids need not make those difficult choices .
i left ug@@ anda with a s@@ nat@@ ch of song that still ech@@ oes within my heart .
its inherent truth would be obvious , had you been there to see :
we are still useful .
to our countries , to our families .
all we need is a way to live our days ,
all we need is to survive in afri@@ ca .
yes , times are hard .
that is all the more reason to act out of comp@@ as@@ sion and with gener@@ osity .
afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; best practices &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but there was something troub@@ ling about this form@@ ulation , in particular with the word &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; developing , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; which is often a eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism for the absence of economic development .
do countries stop developing because out@@ si@@ ders are so intent on developing them ?
my hosts , the k@@ we@@ ku hut@@ ch@@ ful foundation , invited me with a different question in mind : how can gh@@ an@@ a@@ ian leaders be developed ?
something troub@@ led me about this form@@ ulation , too .
it was that word &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; development &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; again .
do we really &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; develop &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; leaders or countries ?
do multinational companies , international non-governmental organizations , and multilateral len@@ ders really understand local needs ?
just because some &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; best practice &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; works in new y@@ or@@ k , does that mean it will work in acc@@ ra , gh@@ ana ?
imagine how ameri@@ can managers would react to consultants arriving from gh@@ ana with their &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; best practice &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; it worked in acc@@ ra , so it is bound to work in new y@@ or@@ k ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
of course , there is a prominent example of just that : ko@@ fi ann@@ an , under whose ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship the un has under@@ gone a remarkable improvement .
of course , ann@@ an can hardly control the un by imposing great strategies on everyone else , as ameri@@ can corporate ce@@ os do .
but perhaps he knows better .
unlike most ameri@@ can ce@@ os , ann@@ an was not par@@ ach@@ uted in from outside ; he is the first career employee to lead the un .
so he knew what was wrong and appreciated that it had to be fixed carefully and pati@@ ently , by engaging the staff rather than intim@@ id@@ ating them .
his re-@@ election to a second term as un secret@@ ary general was supported by nations all over the world , rich and poor , as well as by un employees .
was ko@@ fi ann@@ an &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; developed ? &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
perhaps we don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t develop leaders so much as foster the conditions that bring out leadership .
if so , then a key condition must be the self-@@ respect that comes from working things out for ourselves , individually and collecti@@ vely .
this self-@@ respect is fo@@ ster@@ ed by organizations and institutions that can likewise stand on their own feet , building on the best of their own cultural traditions .
passive import@@ ation of techniques , controls , and belie@@ fs , via agencies and experts that run around solving everyone else &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s problems , may be the biggest impe@@ di@@ ment to develop@@ ment@@ --@@ just another form of outside exploitation , of which afri@@ ca has had more than enough .
is it not time for indigenous development , of countries and leaders alike ?
one thing is clear .
countries like gh@@ ana do not lack enterprise .
markets and personal initiative are per@@ va@@ sive .
at a red light in new y@@ or@@ k , a squ@@ ee@@ gee k@@ id or two might approach your car ; in acc@@ ra , a stopped car is immediately surrounded by a virtual super@@ market .
what gh@@ ana and most of afri@@ ca lacks is not enterprise , but enterprises .
micro-@@ finan@@ c@@ ing@@ --@@ small loans to self-employed cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople and the lik@@ e-@@ -@@ can help .
but development at this level may not be the problem .
the problem is the lack of indigenous enterprises incorporated beyond the efforts of individuals and small families .
instead , foreign corporations , with their funds , controls , and exper@@ ts@@ --@@ and , just as importantly , their belie@@ fs@@ --@@ domin@@ ate larger enterprise .
to be sure , foreign corporations can do good things : bring in fresh ideas , techniques , and processes , as well as capital and the scale required in some contemporary forms of manufacturing .
but nothing they do@@ --@@ aside from cosme@@ tic modifications to consumer products and marketing tac@@ tic@@ s@@ --@@ respon@@ ds to local conditions .
development as now practic@@ ed often fails because it does not build on a country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s unique strengths , respect its social traditions , or foster the autonomy necessary to develop indigenous leaders and enterprises .
all too often , it is forced development , imposed against people &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s natural inc@@ lin@@ ations and will .
pride , dignity , and self-@@ confidence do not figure in economic theory : they cannot be measured .
but they figure promin@@ ently in just about every story of success , whether of countries or of leaders .
how people feel about themselves , personally and collecti@@ vely , greatly influences the energy with which they develop themselves .
ameri@@ ca , for example , did not develop by depending on an imposed ideology or outside experts .
it developed through the indigenous efforts of ameri@@ cans acting in their own wa@@ y-@@ -@@ assisted by extensive state intervention , through land grants to farmers , rail@@ roads , and mining companies , military spending that stimul@@ ated the economy ( and still does ) , and , of course , tariff barriers .
likewise , indigenous development played a key role in jap@@ an and ger@@ many after w@@ wi@@ i , in south korea more recently , and the uk long before .
in fact , has any country ever developed primarily through the wholesale import@@ ation of capital , expertise , and belie@@ fs@@ --@@ the equivalent of globalization today ?
for the answer to how to develop an economy , we need look no further than those economies that have developed : begin with a great deal of indigenous initiative , support it with concer@@ ted state intervention , and reinforce it with the appropriate import@@ ation of external help .
globalization must not be allowed to blind us .
gh@@ ana certainly needs to develop economically , because material wealth is required to improve health , provide education , and sustain democracy .
but the reverse is also true : a deep@@ -@@ roo@@ ted sense of democ@@ rac@@ y-@@ -@@ precisely what globalization l@@ ack@@ s@@ --@@ seems necessary to support economic efforts .
the ( economically ) developed west should consider im@@ porting that lesson .
as a boy , when you join an army , you think you are going to see war as in the movies .
it &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s not like that .
in my first combat , i thought i was going to die , that i would never see my mother again .
it was the mid-@@ 1980s , and we were att@@ acking a for@@ ti@@ fied gar@@ ris@@ on in western ug@@ anda .
i was 15 years old and part of a movement that aimed to rid my country of the cor@@ rupt regime of mil@@ ton obo@@ te , who had succeeded the mur@@ der@@ ous i@@ di amin .
my leader was an inspir@@ ing , bra@@ ve and tal@@ ented man , yo@@ wer@@ i muse@@ ven@@ i , now ug@@ anda &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s president .
muse@@ ven@@ i believed that young figh@@ ters not only needed mar@@ tial skills but also a political awareness of the cause for which they fought - an end to the gre@@ ed and self-@@ del@@ u@@ sion of afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s post-@@ independence leadership .
while still a te@@ en@@ ager , i learned that the goal of war was social and political transformation .
in battle , i came to p@@ ity enemy prisoners because i had a cause to fight for and they did not .
motivated by a political agenda - renovation of my batter@@ ed country - i rose through the ranks to become a tru@@ sted ai@@ de in the circle around muse@@ ven@@ i .
in 1986 , not long after my 16th birthday , muse@@ ven@@ i ou@@ sted obo@@ te .
the war was over . but not for me .
no longer a re@@ bel but now a leader in the ug@@ and@@ an army , i was sent for military training to cu@@ ba , li@@ b@@ ya and north korea .
i became an expert in tank war@@ fare .
while i hung@@ ered for an education - and even en@@ rolled at university - i remained valuable as a soldi@@ er .
first , in my country , i helped tut@@ si refugees from r@@ wand@@ a , where they were a minority , fight a war against the hut@@ u majority there .
in the summer of 1994 , when the hut@@ us slau@@ gh@@ tered the tut@@ sis by the hundreds of thousands , our cause grew in urgency , as did our fighting spirit .
for three years i fought alongside tut@@ sis , finally serving as personal ai@@ de to pau@@ l k@@ ag@@ ame , now r@@ wand@@ a &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s president and his country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s leading political and military strateg@@ ist .
soon president k@@ ag@@ ame asked me to fight in the con@@ go in order to bring an end to the monu@@ mentally cor@@ rupt regime of mo@@ but@@ u .
in the con@@ go i led hundreds of figh@@ ters - many of them children - and helped capture pieces of the country .
in may 1997 , i even helped to capture kin@@ sh@@ asa and ch@@ ase mo@@ but@@ u from power .
i had &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; liber@@ ated &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; a third country , and i was only 27 years old .
ti@@ red of war , the following year i turned politi@@ cian , winning a seat in parliament as a member of muse@@ ven@@ i &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; movement &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; group , the only legal party in ug@@ anda .
last year , i began to fear that muse@@ ven@@ i had become yet another afri@@ can dict@@ ator , more concerned with power than principle .
part of my quar@@ rel with him concerned his failure to establish a genuine multi-@@ party democracy ; also , i objec@@ ted to mounting corruption .
the world bank and other foreign donors supply half of the ug@@ and@@ an government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s budget , but a third of the money is wa@@ sted on sen@@ sel@@ ess military actions such as ug@@ anda &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s invasion of the con@@ go .
muse@@ ven@@ i holds ultimate responsibility for this corruption .
i def@@ ected to a new opposition party and campaign@@ ed on behalf of muse@@ ven@@ i &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s oppon@@ ent in last year &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s presidential election .
even though muse@@ ven@@ i faced no risk of losing , he took no chances , arre@@ sting his oppon@@ ent &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s aids and supporters .
though i had fought fai@@ th@@ fully in muse@@ ven@@ i &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s army as a child , i was now an adult and a cri@@ tic , so he arrested me too .
tor@@ tured by my own brother ( muse@@ ven@@ i &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s chief of internal security ) , i was released after local and international pressure , and i left ug@@ anda for b@@ rit@@ ain .
in tranquil lon@@ don , i now con@@ template my life as a child soldi@@ er .
i have no regre@@ ts , i offer no ap@@ ologies .
yet i am aware of how human rights advocates de@@ pl@@ ore the en@@ list@@ ment of youth into afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s wars , where the lives of many children are ru@@ ined .
in@@ justice provo@@ kes children to pick up g@@ uns .
so does poverty .
in parts of afri@@ ca , poverty means that youth look at g@@ uns as a way of ear@@ ning a living .
power@@ less politically and economically , some children feel that they can only asser@@ t themselves by joining an army .
in ug@@ anda , and in most other sub-@@ sah@@ aran countries , more than 40 % of the population is under the age of 15 .
every country gro@@ ans under the burden of educ@@ ating , emplo@@ ying and absor@@ bing so many young people .
of course , no child should go to war .
but condem@@ ning child soldiers won &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t make them go away .
only education will .
afri@@ can youth must be introduced to democracy and p@@ aci@@ f@@ ism in the class@@ room .
when a child pi@@ cks up a gun , he becomes a man and inspi@@ res fear , if not respect .
in my experience , afri@@ can youth are forgotten except when politicians need them for battle .
if afri@@ can youth are given a better education and the means to influence their communities , then they will be less likely to be used as cann@@ on-@@ fo@@ d@@ der , less likely to pick up a gun , and more likely to read a book .
seven@@ teen years ago , against the wishes of my father , i picked up a gun , hoping to change the world .
i survi@@ ved and learned .
i learned the limits of the gun .
many of my com@@ ra@@ des were rob@@ bed of that chance , for few remain alive .
of those living , most hold senior posts in the ug@@ and@@ an army ; a few are in politics .
yet most died in combat or of aids .
young afri@@ cans should remember this when they look for ways to make their mark .
the success that us president ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush and his special en@@ voy , former secret@@ ary of state j@@ ames bak@@ er , had in getting i@@ ra@@ q &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s foreign debts can@@ cel@@ ed or re@@ scheduled shows what can be done when a policy is backed by political will .
the contrast with afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s debts could hardly be starker .
just three years ago , ju@@ bi@@ le@@ e 2000 made news when civil society groups , rock stars , and a few finance ministers like b@@ rit@@ ain &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s g@@ ord@@ on bro@@ wn pushed for afri@@ can debt cancellation .
president b@@ ush mostly succeeded in his cr@@ us@@ ade ; ju@@ bi@@ le@@ e 2000 succeeded mostly in getting empty promises .
of course , the two campaigns confronted different obstacles and had different bases of support .
bak@@ er &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s mission poss@@ essed the unlimited backing of a us faced with the gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an cost of re@@ construc@@ ting i@@ ra@@ q ; ju@@ bi@@ le@@ e 2000 had only world opinion behind it .
lu@@ cr@@ ative reconstruction contracts in i@@ ra@@ q gave ameri@@ ca leverage to co@@ erce its allies into submission ; ju@@ bi@@ le@@ e 2000 had no such weapon of persu@@ asion .
finally , bak@@ er was appe@@ aling to ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s traditional allies in europ@@ e and the middle east , who need ameri@@ can friend@@ ship in many areas .
the campaign to for@@ give afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s debt was , on the other hand , focused on the cr@@ ush@@ ing debt load o@@ wed by afri@@ can countries to the im@@ f and the world bank , who only have money to worry about .
still , the ju@@ bi@@ le@@ e campaign &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s street protests began a healthy debate about the lending arrangements of the im@@ f / world bank .
but the time has come to abandon the ju@@ bi@@ le@@ e movement &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s humanitarian approach and focus instead on the legal aspect .
it is worth remember@@ ing that no sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can country - with the exceptions of south afri@@ ca and r@@ ho@@ des@@ ia ( now zim@@ babwe ) , then administer@@ ed by white minority governments - could tap international capital markets at independence in the early 1960 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s .
domestic capital markets were non-@@ exist@@ ent .
as a result , these countries were left with no choice but to sub@@ contract their development to the im@@ f and world bank .
these institutions identified , app@@ raised , approved , and financed projects that rat@@ ch@@ eted up afri@@ can debt .
they monitored and sanc@@ tioned the recruitment of consultants that conducted the studies related to these projects , as well as the exp@@ atri@@ ate staff involved in their execution .
during the period of implementation , they carried out regular supervisory missions supple@@ mented by quar@@ ter@@ ly progress reports and annual audi@@ ts .
still , despite all these costly measures paid for by afri@@ cans , all the post-@@ evaluation reports on completed projects indicated that the overwhelming majority of projects were unable to generate the revenues needed to service the debts that financed them .
but the deb@@ tor countries are nonetheless obliged to service these debts by whatever means necessary , including more borro@@ wing and further ent@@ ang@@ lement , leading to further im@@ pover@@ ishment .
for example , per capita growth between 1965 and 199@@ 8@@ was -@@ 0.@@ 8 in i@@ vor@@ y coast and gh@@ ana , -@@ 0.1 in gu@@ ine@@ a bis@@ sau , -@@ 2 in z@@ ambi@@ a and mau@@ rit@@ ania , and zero in ni@@ geri@@ a .
what went wrong ?
the multilateral len@@ ders advoc@@ ated a development strategy based on the theory of comparative advantage and un@@ bri@@ d@@ led economic liberalization .
afri@@ ca had to open its markets while producing raw materials and basic products to generate revenues for investment in industry , education , health , and food production .
these assu@@ mp@@ tions turned out to be wrong , as export prices fell steadily over four decades .
but it should have been obvious from the outset that the im@@ f / world bank strategy was do@@ om@@ ed to fail .
all developed nations protected and subsidi@@ zed their domestic production in the first phases of their development - and still do whenever it suits them .
furthermore the us , the eu member states and the east asi@@ an countries all regulated in@@ ward foreign investment and imposed capital controls .
partnerships with foreign companies were designed to allow local businesses to benefit from technology transfer and training , while creating the most favor@@ able conditions for local producers to add value to domestic production and exports .
in the face of these un@@ den@@ i@@ able facts , the path chosen by the im@@ f and the world bank was , at best , a mark of their in@@ competence and , at worst , a deliber@@ ate plo@@ y to keep the sub-@@ sah@@ aran countries and their populations in bon@@ da@@ ge .
whatever the case , both institutions certainly have much to answer for - and the loan agreements provide an arbit@@ ration clause to bring them to account .
these clauses have yet to be invo@@ ked , but for the sake of unity and to strengthen the solidarity of afri@@ can countries , it would be advis@@ able for the nas@@ cent afri@@ can union take the lead .
the au should seek legal advice , have the issue included on the agenda of the un general assembly , advocate the free@@ zing of international debt payments while arbit@@ ration proceedings are taking place and secure the support of the international community , especially n@@ gos that have a track record in raising awareness about afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s debts .
any compensation retri@@ e@@ ved from such legal proceedings should be used to establish an afri@@ can monetary fund whose objective would be to put afri@@ ca on a fast track to comprehensive regional integration , enabling the continent to cap@@ itali@@ ze on globalization &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s positive features .
liti@@ gation can be costly and hazardous .
however , set against the alternative of rel@@ ying on hand@@ outs pun@@ ctu@@ ated by desper@@ ation and frequent episo@@ des of collective self-@@ destruction , afri@@ ca should choose the legal option to r@@ ally its people and rescue its development process .
br@@ ussel@@ s – the recent death in br@@ ussel@@ s of eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian prime minister mel@@ es zen@@ aw@@ i finally brings to light what lay behind his mysteri@@ ous two-@@ month dis@@ appearance from public life .
eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia ’ s government had stren@@ u@@ ously denied rum@@ ors of serious ill health caused by li@@ ver cancer .
now that the worst has , indeed , proven true , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia and all of east afri@@ ca will need to learn to live without the stabili@@ zing influence of its great dictator@@ -@@ diplom@@ at .
mel@@ es was certainly both .
eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia has under@@ gone a remarkable transformation under his strong@@ man rule since 1991 , when his ti@@ gra@@ yan minority group from the country ’ s north came to power with the over@@ throw of the o@@ di@@ ous communist der@@ g led by meng@@ ist@@ u ha@@ ile mari@@ am ( still enjoying a comfortable retirement in ro@@ bert mu@@ gabe ’ s zim@@ babwe ) .
initially serving as the president of the first post-@@ der@@ g government , and then as eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia ’ s prime minister from 1995 until his death , mel@@ es ( his no@@ m de gu@@ er@@ re in the revolution ) over@@ saw 7.@@ 7 % annual g@@ d@@ p growth in recent years .
strong economic performance is somewhat surprising , given his party ’ s interven@@ tion@@ ist policy approach , but mel@@ es showed himself to be a consu@@ mm@@ ate pragmati@@ st in attrac@@ ting investment – particularly from ch@@ ina – to drive growth .
but , when the cold war ended , so , too , did his dog@@ mati@@ s@@ m .
to his credit , child mortality was reduced by 40 % under his government ; eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia ’ s economy became more diversi@@ fied , with new industries like car manufacturing , beverages , and fl@@ or@@ icul@@ ture ; and major infrastructure projects , including afri@@ ca ’ s largest hydro@@ electric dam , were launched .
once a bas@@ k@@ et-@@ case associated in the world ’ s eyes only with fam@@ ine and d@@ rought , eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia has become one of afri@@ ca ’ s largest economies – and without the benefit of gold or oil .
perhaps more important than mel@@ es ’ s domestic achievements was his diplomatic record . he was an indispensable ally of the west in the fight against islam@@ ist terrorism , cul@@ min@@ ating in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia ’ s military operation in neighbor@@ ing som@@ alia in 2006 .
more recently , mel@@ es coordinated efforts with ken@@ ya to stage limited strikes against the al-@@ sh@@ ab@@ a@@ ab mi@@ liti@@ a , which has w@@ aged an un@@ rel@@ enting war to turn som@@ alia into a fundament@@ alist islam@@ ic the@@ oc@@ racy .
more important , mel@@ es put addi@@ s ab@@ aba on the map as the home of the afri@@ can union , and as a capital where afri@@ ca ’ s worst problems could be discussed in a pragmatic manner , un@@ bur@@ dened by colonial gru@@ dges .
mel@@ es himself became a major diplomatic player , particularly over cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ change policy , and most recently was active in medi@@ ating border and natur@@ al-@@ resource disputes between su@@ dan and the newly independent ( and o@@ il-@@ rich ) south su@@ dan .
he will be remember@@ ed for accepting the painful sec@@ ession of er@@ it@@ rea in 1993 , rather than pro@@ long the civil war , and for his efforts to reach an agreement with eg@@ yp@@ t over the use of the blue ni@@ le waters .
the great stain on mel@@ es ’ s record will always be his in@@ tolerance of dis@@ sent .
to be sure , his hum@@ an-@@ rights record was far better than the der@@ g ’ s .
for example , he allowed a private press to flour@@ ish , and in 2000 he became the first eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian leader to hold multi-@@ party parliamentary elections . moreover , compared to neighbor@@ ing er@@ it@@ rea under president is@@ ai@@ as af@@ e@@ wer@@ ki or om@@ ar al-@@ b@@ ash@@ ir ’ s su@@ dan , his regime was by no means the worst off@@ ender in the region .
nor was there much evidence of personal enrich@@ ment or widespread corruption .
nevertheless , following a viol@@ ently con@@ tested parliamentary election in 2005 , in which more than 30 parties participated , mel@@ es demonstrated open con@@ temp@@ t for democratic plur@@ alism and press freedom , j@@ ailing several journalists in recent years . at the same time , he imposed increasingly strict central control on his eth@@ ni@@ cally and lingu@@ is@@ tically diverse country .
although nomin@@ ally governed by “ ethnic feder@@ alism , ” where this threatened sec@@ ession , as in or@@ om@@ ia or the o@@ ga@@ den , mel@@ es was quick to ignore the constitutional set@@ -up .
although he strengthened religious freedom and peaceful co@@ existence between mus@@ li@@ ms and ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans , the hum@@ an-@@ rights situation in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia remained poor .
for example , groups like freedom house and human rights watch have documented widespread official repression of the or@@ omo people .
and yet mel@@ es is irre@@ plac@@ eable – un@@ matched intellec@@ tu@@ ally as an afri@@ can leader ( he dropped out of medical school , but went on to teach himself im@@ pec@@ cable english and obtain europ@@ ean university degrees by correspon@@ dence ) , and un@@ matched politically at home , with no obvious successor gro@@ om@@ ed to replace him .
in the horn of afri@@ ca , there is no leader of his stat@@ ure who could ensure the stability and strong governance that the region so desper@@ ately needs .
ha@@ i@@ le@@ mari@@ am des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , mel@@ es ’ s foreign minister , will take over eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia ’ s government .
but there will be considerable concern in the west about the danger of a power vacuum or struggle in a geo@@ politically vital but fra@@ cti@@ ous country – and just when neighbor@@ ing som@@ alia is supposed to be under@@ going a transition to a new parliament and elected government .

afri@@ ca ’ s hard black gold
la@@ gos - few infrastructure services in the developed world may be as taken for granted as electric power .
to consumers in industri@@ alized countries , un@@ inter@@ rupted power supply is a given .
not so in much of afri@@ ca , which experiences some of the world ’ s greatest power deficits , and where only two in ten people have access to electricity .
according to the international monetary fund ’ s most recent regional economic outlook for sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , in 2007 alone , nearly two-@@ thirds of the countries in the region experienced an acute energy crisis marked by frequent and extended electricity out@@ ages .
there is no shortage of hydro@@ power plants for electricity generation in afri@@ ca .
however , many of these plants are unable to keep up with rapid population growth and atten@@ dant increases in demand .
furthermore , they are pr@@ one to frequent d@@ rought , which reduces their output significantly , leaving many as little more than decor@@ ative infrastructure land@@ marks .
increasingly bur@@ ge@@ oning populations in countries like ni@@ geri@@ a and gh@@ ana imply a greater extra@@ ction of water resources for power generation .
rapid expansion of agricultural activity is requiring more and more water all across the continent .
other resources like fuel oil , diesel , light cru@@ de , solar , and gas are also available as means of electricity generation , but their costs are all quite pro@@ hibi@@ tive .
these factors make a good argument for coal as a cheap alternative source of afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s power .
coal has histor@@ ically played a crucial role as a source of energy worldwide , and has several important advantages over other fossil fuels . first is its relative abund@@ ance .
the current level of proven coal reserves worldwide stands at roughly 8@@ 50 billion tons .
afri@@ ca has about 50 billion tons .
coal is also much more widely distributed geograph@@ ically than any other fossil fuel .
worldwide energy demand has increased by more than 50 % since 1980 , and is expected to grow annually by 1.6 % between now and 2030 .
more than 70 % of this new demand will come from developing countries , with fossil fuels projected to account for about 80 % of total energy demand by the end of this period .
coal is the world ’ s fastest growing fossil fuel , with annual production increasing by 6.@@ 4 % since 2004 .
it is already the dominant source of power generation in some very important energy-@@ consu@@ ming nations .
much of the future increases in co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red electricity generation will come from strategi@@ cally important developing countries like ch@@ ina and indi@@ a .
in 2006 alone , ch@@ ina added about 93@@ ,000 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of co@@ al@@ - fi@@ red electricity generating capacity , and this trend is expected to continue as the country tries to meet its huge energy needs .
even in many developed countries , coal still accounts for a large share of power generation .
coal plants currently provide more than half of ameri@@ ca ’ s electricity supply .
den@@ mark , which houses some of the most efficient co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red power plants in the world , equally re@@ lies on coal for half of its electricity production .
the same is true for ger@@ many , which is home to some of the most efficient pul@@ ver@@ ized coal comb@@ us@@ tion units in europ@@ e .
against this picture then , it is hard not to expect developing countries to exploit their abund@@ ant coal resources to generate power for their own development , especially given that modern technology can help produce coal clean@@ ly .
some argue that gas might be a better alternative to hydr@@ o or coal , but for countries that must import much of their gas the benefits of a stable and reliable source of cheap fuel in the form of coal present a very strong counter-@@ argument to the capital costs of a gas plant .
unlike prices for coal , which is abund@@ ant and dis@@ per@@ sed geograph@@ ically , gas prices are subject to significant vol@@ atility , and the long-term trend in the face of fossil fuel deple@@ tion is uncertain .
in contrast , coal prices are more stable , and may remain that way for a long time .
apart from electri@@ c-@@ power generation , coal also has wide application in a number of industries .
it is pi@@ vo@@ tal in both steel and cement production .
moreover , the use of wood by afri@@ ca ’ s growing population is causing increasingly rapid de@@ fore@@ station in many countries .
there is significant potential domestic demand for coal bri@@ qu@@ et@@ tes to replace wood for cooking and domestic and industrial heating .
the demand outlook thus appears favor@@ able for the coal industry , creating significant investment opportunities .
clearly , there are environmental draw@@ backs from the use of coal as an energy resource , and these concerns are far too important to over@@ look .
the massive reserves not@@ with@@ standing , coal is still a fin@@ ite resource .
it must be mined with greater efficiency and with a view to mitig@@ ating the environmental impact .
fortunately , much greater attention is paid today to mine safety and the management of the by-@@ products of coal use .
with acid rain and other public-@@ health haz@@ ards linked to coal comb@@ us@@ tion , more technologies are emerging for reducing harmful emissions from power plants .
fu@@ eled by research , the past few years have witnessed the development of increasingly clean@@ er and more energy-@@ efficient co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red generation plants and the retirement of older technologies , especially in the developed world .
developing countries have lag@@ ged behind in this process , but , with the common threat of global warming , there is now growing pressure to adopt conservation policies .
afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s miner@@ al-@@ rich countries must exploit their abund@@ ant natural resources .
they must use coal to advance their economic development .
failure to do so would be a missed opportunity at a time when afri@@ can countries must av@@ ail themselves of all available resources for poverty reduction .
acc@@ ra – the united states suff@@ ers rising job losses .
b@@ rit@@ ain nation@@ ali@@ zes its banks .
once high-@@ flying small economies like i@@ reland , hung@@ ary , and ic@@ eland break down .
even robust ch@@ ina and indi@@ a are experiencing s@@ lower growth , cur@@ ta@@ iled ambitions , and broken dreams .
yet , in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , there are few hin@@ ts of the global financial crisis that is consu@@ ming the capital@@ ist world .
in fashi@@ onable afri@@ can cities , residential home prices remain str@@ ato@@ sph@@ eric .
a typical west@@ ern@@ -@@ style house in kamp@@ ala or acc@@ ra , for example , now costs an aston@@ ishing two to three times the price of a comparable home in , say , cle@@ vel@@ and or other cities in the ameri@@ can hear@@ t@@ land .
while home prices are cr@@ ash@@ ing from ma@@ dri@@ d to du@@ bl@@ in and mi@@ ami to los angel@@ es , afri@@ can prices remain near or at record@@ -@@ high levels .
afri@@ can banks , mean@@ while , are ro@@ ck-@@ solid compared to their deb@@ t-@@ heavy counterparts in the us and europ@@ e .
while international ban@@ kers went b@@ ust by making legi@@ ons of bad loans , afri@@ can ban@@ kers stu@@ ck to ear@@ ning profits the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned way : paying very little to de@@ posit@@ ors , and ear@@ ning a big “ spread ” by buying guaranteed government debt , which yiel@@ ded healthy returns .
even government deficit spending – long the ban@@ e of afri@@ ca – seems positively pun@@ y compared to the massive debts that the us and some europ@@ ean countries face .
the new ob@@ ama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record us deficit of more than one tril@@ lion dollars – and this coming on top of the out@@ going b@@ ush administration ’ s record deficit .
and yet there are good reasons to believe that it is just a matter of time before afri@@ ca and its peoples experience the ill effects of the global crisis .
from gh@@ ana to ken@@ ya , governments are having increased difficulty in raising money for infrastructure projects and selling official debt .
foreign investment in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , which reached record levels in recent years , is re@@ treating , which is evidence of investor cau@@ tion , not any underlying lack of optim@@ ism about the region .
and exports of raw materials to ch@@ ina , indi@@ a , europ@@ e , and the us – a key factor in afri@@ ca ’ s recent growth sur@@ ge – may suffer simply because the global slow@@ down means less consumption everywhere .
all of these factors suggest that an afri@@ can financial b@@ ust is possible .
popular equity investments , such as shares in saf@@ ari@@ com , are already trading at un@@ expec@@ tedly low levels .
if real estate prices were to fall dramatically , a chain reaction could occur , taking down big and small investors alike , and over time causing wide suffering to ordinary afri@@ cans .
even assu@@ ming stability in real estate prices , the global crisis surely will cause a fall in re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces by afri@@ cans working good jobs in europ@@ e , the us , can@@ ada , au@@ str@@ alia , and the middle east .
re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces are already believed to be falling , which makes sense : immigrants in rich countries are and will be dis@@ proportion@@ ately h@@ urt by s@@ lowing economic activity .
immigration itself may even slow dramatically , depending on the length and depth of the economic slow@@ down .
fewer afri@@ cans working in rich countries will automatically translate into less money circul@@ ating in afri@@ can countries .
the decline in re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces , however , cuts both ways .
re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces have long sp@@ urred inflation in many parts of afri@@ ca .
a ug@@ and@@ an doctor working in nor@@ way , for instance , ca@@ res little about the cost of a beer in kamp@@ ala .
he is also willing – and able – to pay more than a local doctor for services and , of course , a home in ug@@ anda .
fewer re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces f@@ lowing into ug@@ anda could mean less economic activity – or simply lower prices .
the financial mel@@ t@@ down in the us , which inc@@ ub@@ ated the global crisis , is either coming under control or threatening to mut@@ ate into a new , more vir@@ ul@@ ent form that could destroy not only ameri@@ ca ’ s paper economy of trading and bro@@ k@@ ering , but also its real economy of goods and services .
president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama , acting as if the latter scenario remains likely , is bet@@ ting on large-scale government spending to pro@@ p up the real economy .
if his administration succ@@ ee@@ ds , the chances that afri@@ ca will remain relatively un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed will grow .
even if ob@@ ama fails , however , afri@@ cans should escape the worst of the global crisis , for both good reasons and bad .
the good reasons have to do with afri@@ can self-@@ reli@@ ance and a growing awareness among schol@@ ars and policymakers that trade within the region – especially between urban and rural afri@@ ca – will ultimately deliver enormous benefits .
another factor working in afri@@ ca ’ s favor is its private companies ’ and consumers ’ low dependence on borro@@ wed money .
people tend to pay cash for goods and services , however costly .
in the us , loans for cars and homes – loans that now aren ’ t being paid back – are the major factor behind the financial crisis .
in afri@@ ca , very few people bor@@ row money for such purchases .
afri@@ ca ’ s c@@ ash@@ -based economy has in the past constra@@ ined development .
after all , by allowing people to spend more than they have , borro@@ wed money can fuel growth .
but today , afri@@ ca ’ s pa@@ y-@@ as-@@ you@@ -@@ go practices are a powerful defense against financial con@@ ta@@ gion .
another way of looking at afri@@ ca ’ s parado@@ x@@ ical economic position is to admit that the region ’ s historical margin@@ alization within the international financial system – so costly in times of global plenty – is proving to be an un@@ expected benefit when the weal@@ thi@@ est of the world are si@@ ck unto death .
afri@@ ca ’ s integration imperative
kar@@ l mar@@ x predic@@ ted that states would wi@@ ther away in anticip@@ ation of an id@@ yl@@ lic communist society capable of au@@ to-@@ regulating economic imbalances and em@@ power@@ ing the m@@ asses .
so he would have been fl@@ ab@@ ber@@ gast@@ ed to see his pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y realized , not by commun@@ ism , but by the globalization of ang@@ lo@@ -@@ ameri@@ can economic liber@@ alism .
opening up markets to the free flow of capital , not the dictatorship of the pro@@ let@@ ariat , has ren@@ dered state power ob@@ sole@@ te .
today ’ s capital markets raise money for governments , corporate clients , and individual customers , manage pension funds ’ investments , and bet on the level of interest rates or the stock market .
trading in derivatives by investment banks , he@@ dge funds , and other market participants , re@@ aps huge profits for traders while depri@@ ving the real economy of productive investment and job creation .
no population in the world is sp@@ ared from the har@@ sh treatment of such a system .
some 40 % of the world ’ s 6.@@ 5 billion people live in poverty , and a sixth live in extreme poverty .
however , the world ’ s black populations are the prime victims .
in the united states , one-@@ eigh@@ th of all black m@@ ales between the ages of 25 and 34 are in j@@ ail , and three out of five black ameri@@ can households with children are headed by a single mother .
as for afri@@ can countries , the politics and economics of globalization have stri@@ pped them of their assets and natural resources and left them with an unbe@@ ar@@ able debt burden .
as a result , the percentage of afri@@ ca ’ s population living in extreme poverty increased from 4@@ 1.6 % in 1981 to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % in 2001 .
on the other hand , in the era of globalization , regions in which internal trade exceeds external trade have better economic out@@ looks and stronger social cohesion .
this is the case for europ@@ e , a@@ sia , and , increasingly , l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , particularly among the member states of mer@@ co@@ sur ( ar@@ gent@@ ina , bra@@ zi@@ l , ch@@ ile , ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay , and parag@@ u@@ ay ) .
the opposite is true for regional group@@ ings in afri@@ ca and in the middle east where trade with the outside world is more important than in@@ tra-@@ regional trade .
as a result , any country formul@@ ating strategies to counter the destruc@@ tive forces of globalization should give over@@ riding priority to a self-@@ cent@@ red economic development strategy , prefer@@ ably within a regional framework .
this is a prerequisite to defending against market fundament@@ alism and avoiding the ini@@ qu@@ it@@ ous conditions of the international market@@ place .
in this respect , the association of sou@@ theast asi@@ an nations ( brun@@ ei dar@@ uss@@ al@@ am , cam@@ bo@@ dia , in@@ don@@ esia , la@@ os , mal@@ ay@@ sia , my@@ an@@ mar , p@@ hili@@ pp@@ ines , sin@@ ga@@ por@@ e , th@@ ail@@ and , and vi@@ et@@ nam ) constitutes an edi@@ fying example .
the as@@ ean economies adopted a united front on international economic issues and accord@@ ed priority to internal economic integration and expanding lin@@ k@@ ages with major trading partners .
exports have remained the main driver of economic performance for the as@@ ean countries , contributing to 5.@@ 8 % regional g@@ d@@ p growth in 2006 .
as@@ ean foreign direct investment ( f@@ di ) flows reached us $ 38 billion in 2005 , up by 48 % from the previous year .
the outlook for 2006 was also bul@@ l@@ ish , with preliminary data for the first quarter indicating that f@@ di flows had already reached us $ 14 billion , up from us $ 7.@@ 4 billion in the year-@@ earlier period .
as@@ ean ’ s drive to establish a fully-@@ fle@@ dged economic community has been underlined by implementation of its priority integration sector road@@ maps .
by contrast , sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca ’ s historical legacy of artificial and un@@ manage@@ able colonial boundaries , ethnic ant@@ agon@@ isms , its citizens ’ deficit of self-@@ respect , and an app@@ alling record of leadership failures has ham@@ pered its quest for economic integration .
but a sec@@ tor@@ -@@ by-@@ sector approach could mitig@@ ate these han@@ di@@ caps , and , given the pressing need to address demand for energy and climate change , it might be strategi@@ cally advis@@ able to start with the energy sector .
afri@@ ca is a continent rich in energy , holding two-@@ thirds of the world ’ s reserves of hydro@@ -@@ electric power – tril@@ li@@ ons of kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hours representing about half of total world resources .
the con@@ go river alone holds more than 600 billion kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hours of annual reserves . the san@@ aga ( cam@@ ero@@ on ) and the o@@ go@@ ou@@ é ( gab@@ on ) hold half as much .
technological break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s have made it feasible to transport electricity via high-@@ voltage direct current ( h@@ v@@ d@@ c ) over long distances without inc@@ urr@@ ing great losses ( only about 3 % per 1,000 kilometers ) .
car@@ b@@ on-@@ free hydro@@ electric power is the right choice as sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca ’ s principal source of energy .
har@@ ness@@ ing the hydro@@ electric power of the con@@ go basin alone would be enough to meet all of afri@@ ca ’ s energy needs , or to light the entire continent of south ameri@@ ca . moreover , establishing an afri@@ can grid would enable power from the democratic re@@ public of con@@ go to be delivered to southern europ@@ ean countries such as sp@@ ain , portu@@ gal , and ital@@ y .
however , while 90 % of world reserves of hydrau@@ lic energy are concentrated in under@@ developed regions like sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , h@@ v@@ d@@ c technology remains the preserve of developed countries .
there is thus an imperative not only for regional integration in afri@@ ca , but also for a joint strategic vision and partnership to help build global energy and climate security .
dak@@ ar – sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can is in the gri@@ p of curr@@ enc@@ y-@@ union man@@ ia .
regional groups of countries in eastern , southern , and western afri@@ ca are all giving priority to the idea of creating a monetary union .
but haven ’ t we heard this all before in afri@@ ca ?
indeed , today ’ s enthusiasm for currency unions igno@@ res the poor track record of previous attempts on the continent to establish them through peaceful means .
a common currency requires unified and centrally agreed monetary and fiscal policies .
but this nec@@ es@@ sit@@ ates political integration , which , as the troub@@ les of the euro this year have demonstrated , is a hard sell among nation@@ -@@ states .
before the euro ’ s arrival on the international financial scene in 1999 , the only examples of countries with common currencies were neo-@@ colonial fran@@ cop@@ h@@ one afri@@ ca and nine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century prece@@ dents like the l@@ atin ameri@@ can and sc@@ andin@@ avian monetary unions .
the creation of the c@@ fa fran@@ c , which gives fran@@ ce control of 65 % of the c@@ fa countries ’ foreign@@ -@@ exchange reserves , combined currency con@@ verti@@ bility with a gross@@ ly over@@ valued par@@ ity – pe@@ gged first to the f@@ ren@@ ch fran@@ c and now to the euro – as well as trade barriers .
this led only to structural deficits , vast capital flight , and , in 1994 , a 100 % de@@ valuation .
yet , despite the difficulties that have be@@ de@@ vil@@ ed the c@@ fa ( and the euro of late ) – indeed , despite the absence of viable regional customs unions ( except in the east afri@@ can community ) , let alone a single market – afri@@ cans retain a strong alle@@ gi@@ ance to the idea of a currency union .
that alle@@ gi@@ ance is mis@@ placed .
at this stage of their economic development , with its focus on commodity exports , the priority for afri@@ ca ’ s countries should be long-term economic integration , not currency union .
here , the model to follow is not the euro , but l@@ atin ameri@@ ca ’ s southern common market ( mer@@ co@@ sur ) and the association of sou@@ theast asi@@ an nations ( as@@ ean ) .
both regional group@@ ings have , by lower@@ ing trade barriers , delivered a real cataly@@ st to economic growth .
mer@@ co@@ sur ’ s member countries have adopted a strategy that priori@@ tiz@@ es the creation of a free-@@ trade area .
they ste@@ ered clear of establishing a heavy bud@@ ge@@ t-@@ fu@@ eled bureaucracy , leaving respective min@@ istri@@ es to handle administer@@ ing the acc@@ ord . in 2008 , mer@@ co@@ sur in@@ tra-@@ regional exports reached $ 4@@ 1.6 billion , up by 28.@@ 4 % from 2007 .
the external trade of parag@@ u@@ ay , ar@@ gent@@ ina , and bra@@ zi@@ l within the area amoun@@ ted , respectively , to 65 % , 33 % , and 15 % of their total exports .
the other major advantage of such regional group@@ ings has been their ability to attract foreign direct investment . since the early 1990 ’ s , mer@@ co@@ sur has managed to mobili@@ ze 5.@@ 9 % of world f@@ di in@@ flows .
the seven member countries of as@@ ean decided to implement economic “ road@@ maps ” defining integration priorities , a testi@@ mon@@ y to their determination to achieve a single economic community .
a currency union , however , is not high on the agenda .
in 2009 , as@@ ean regional trade represented 24.@@ 6 % of its members ’ total exports and 24.@@ 3 % of total imports .
by contrast , trade among afri@@ can countries accounts for only about 10-@@ 12 % of the continent ’ s exports and imports .
but , partly because several afri@@ can countries have escap@@ ed the hang@@ -@@ over from the global credit crisis , more investors are focusing on business opportunities there .
by 2050 , the combined g@@ d@@ p of the largest 11 afri@@ can economies should reach more than $ 13 tril@@ lion , sur@@ passing bra@@ zi@@ l and rus@@ sia ( but not ch@@ ina or indi@@ a ) .
for some an@@ al@@ yst@@ s , the emergence of countries like bra@@ zi@@ l as economic power@@ houses st@@ ems partly from successful dem@@ ut@@ u@@ alization of their stock exchanges .
twenty-@@ three bour@@ ses are currently operating in afri@@ ca , and their combined market cap@@ itali@@ zation has so@@ ared from $ 2@@ 45 billion in 2002 to $ 1 tril@@ lion ( 2 % of the world total ) at the end of 2009 – as high as the fif@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ largest stock exchange in the world .
with a volume of $ 800 billion , the j@@ oh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg stock exchange alone accounts for 80 % of the total and ranks 19th worldwide . ni@@ geri@@ a plans to dem@@ ut@@ u@@ alize its stock exchange in order to establish it among the prime destinations for frontier investors .
afri@@ ca stands to benefit from a massive economic turn@@ around , provided that the right environment for sustainable growth and rising productivity is created .
this requires consistent macroeconomic policies focused on economic integration , food self-@@ suffici@@ ency , low inflation , and reduced debt .
it also requires political stability , eradication of corruption , enhanced rule of law , improvement of basic levels of education , and greater use of mobile teleph@@ ones and the internet .
what it does not require is a currency union .
when it comes to exchange rates , the members of afri@@ ca ’ s economic group@@ ings would be better off linking their currencies in regional monetary systems to prevent large fluctu@@ ations relative to one another .
afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s o@@ di@@ ous debts
one side effect of the ameri@@ can / bri@@ tish occupation of i@@ ra@@ q is that it spark@@ ed public debate on a dark secret of international finance : the debts taken on by o@@ di@@ ous regimes .
as i@@ ra@@ q &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s new rul@@ ers debate what to do about the billions of dollars in foreign debts inher@@ ited from sad@@ dam hus@@ sein &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s regime , voices ranging from the char@@ ity ox@@ fam@@ -@@ international to us defence g@@ ur@@ u rich@@ ard per@@ le are calling for debt re@@ pu@@ di@@ ation on the grounds that the debts i@@ ra@@ q now bears were contrac@@ ted to sustain a cor@@ rupt , op@@ pres@@ sive regime .
i@@ ra@@ q is not the only country bur@@ dened by such debts .
across sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , many of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s poorest people struggle with the crip@@ pling legacy of prof@@ lig@@ ate lending to cor@@ rupt , op@@ pres@@ sive rul@@ ers .
during his 32-@@ year dictatorship , con@@ go &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s former president jo@@ se@@ ph mo@@ but@@ u accumul@@ ated a personal fortun@@ e estimated at $ 4 billion , while his government ran up a $ 12 billion foreign debt .
more of the same in ang@@ ola , where last year an im@@ f investigation revealed that $ 4 billion disappeared from ang@@ ola &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s treas@@ ury over the past five years .
it so happens that the ang@@ ol@@ an government borro@@ wed a similar sum from private banks in this period , mort@@ g@@ aging future oil revenues as security .
much of afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ill-@@ gotten wealth is now st@@ ash@@ ed abroad .
in a study of 30 sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ can countries , we estimate that total capital flight for the period 197@@ 0-@@ 1996 amoun@@ ted to $ 18@@ 7 billion .
adding imp@@ uted interest earnings , the stock of afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s capital flight stood at $ 27@@ 4 billion - a sum equivalent to 14@@ 5 % of the debts o@@ wed by those countries .
in other words , sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca is a net credi@@ tor to the rest of the world : its external assets exceed its external debts .
statistical analysis reveals that roughly 80 c@@ ents on every dollar borro@@ wed by afri@@ can countries f@@ lowed back as capital flight in the same year .
foreign borro@@ wing and capital flight were connected by a financial revol@@ ving door , as funds borro@@ wed in the name of governments were captured by politically connected individuals and chann@@ eled overseas as their private wealth .
moreover , every dollar added to a country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s total debt generated 3 to 4 c@@ ents of extra capital flight per year in subsequent years , im@@ plying that capital flight was partly a response to the deterior@@ ating economic environment associated with rising debt burdens .
in the last decade , sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca recorded a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; net transfer &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ( new borro@@ wing min@@ us debt service on past loans ) of negative $ 11 billion .
that is , more money f@@ lowed out of afri@@ ca to credi@@ tors than returned as fresh lending .
the countries of the region spend more on debt service than on health . despite this ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , the debt burden gro@@ ws ever larger .
but there is a remedy at hand .
the doc@@ tr@@ ine of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; o@@ di@@ ous debt &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dates from the end of the 19th century , when the us government re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated cu@@ ba &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s external debt after sei@@ zing the island in the span@@ ish-@@ ameri@@ can war .
ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s authorities argued that cu@@ ba &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s debt had not been incurred for the benefit of the cu@@ ban people , nor with their consent , and that foreign loans helped to finance their op@@ pression .
similar reason@@ ing can be applied today not only to i@@ ra@@ q , but to afri@@ ca as well .
properly functioning financial markets require credi@@ tors to bear the consequences of imp@@ ru@@ dent lending .
the notion that len@@ ders should always be re@@ paid , regardless of how and to whom they lend , is inde@@ fen@@ sible .
the logic of sound banking tells us that current and future afri@@ can governments should accept liability only for those por@@ tions of public debts that were incurred to finance b@@ ona fi@@ de domestic investment or public consumption .
invo@@ king the doc@@ tr@@ ine of o@@ di@@ ous debt , they could selec@@ tively re@@ pu@@ di@@ ate that portion of the debt for which no such uses can be demonstrated .
this policy poses two practical problems .
the first is to determine who should bear the burden of proof in identifying which debts are &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; o@@ di@@ ous . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
given the evidence of widespread capital flight fu@@ eled by external borro@@ wing , afri@@ can governments can rightly insist that credi@@ tors have the responsibility of establishing that their loans were used for b@@ ona fi@@ de purposes .
if the fate of borro@@ wed money cannot be trac@@ ed , then they must in@@ fer that it was diver@@ ted into private po@@ ckets .
the second problem is that credi@@ tors may with@@ hold new lending from governments that have the ner@@ ve to reject o@@ di@@ ous debts .
but today resources flow from afri@@ ca to credi@@ tors , rather than the reverse .
in the short run , afri@@ can countries will save money by staun@@ ching this out@@ flow .
in the long run , selective re@@ pu@@ di@@ ation of o@@ di@@ ous debts will benefit both borro@@ wers and credi@@ tors by promoting more responsible lending practices .
if i@@ ra@@ q &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s occupation gives impetus to legal challenges that free afri@@ cans from the burden of o@@ di@@ ous debts , then the war will have succeeded in disman@@ tling at least one weapon of mass destruction .
it takes a threat to oil supplies to get world leaders to pay attention to afri@@ ca .
usually neglec@@ ted by glo@@ betro@@ t@@ ting stat@@ es@@ men , the continent recently saw visits from us president ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush , chin@@ ese president h@@ u j@@ inta@@ o , bra@@ zi@@ l &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s l@@ ula da sil@@ va , german chan@@ cell@@ or ger@@ hard sch@@ ro@@ eder and many other world leaders .
their public comments were typically devoted to development , ending afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s many wars , and the fight against hi@@ v / aids , but all of them had oil on their minds .
an oil r@@ ush is underway in the continent , because all developed countries &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; national security depends on a steady oil supply , and sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca own@@ s 8 % of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s known reserves .
in 2002 production was 2.1 million bar@@ rel@@ s a day in ni@@ geri@@ a , 9@@ 00@@ ,000 in ang@@ ola , 28@@ 3@@ ,000 in con@@ go bra@@ zz@@ av@@ ille , 26@@ 5@@ ,000 in equ@@ at@@ orial gu@@ ine@@ a , 24@@ 7@@ ,000 in gab@@ on , 2@@ 27@@ ,000 in su@@ dan , 75@@ ,000 in cam@@ ero@@ on , 28@@ ,000 in south afri@@ ca , 25@@ ,000 in the democratic re@@ public of con@@ go , and 1@@ 1,000 in i@@ vor@@ y coast .
the us alone imports 1.5 million bar@@ rel@@ s a day from west afri@@ ca , the same amount it imports from sau@@ di arab@@ ia .
according to the us energy department , within this decade ameri@@ can oil imports from afri@@ ca will reach 7@@ 70 millions bar@@ rel@@ s annually , as expl@@ oration intensi@@ fies throughout the g@@ ulf of gu@@ ine@@ a , and as the us bro@@ kers peace in war@@ -@@ ra@@ v@@ aged o@@ il-@@ producing countries , such as su@@ dan and ang@@ ola , and establishes strategic bases to safeguard output .
as a result , west afri@@ can oil producers will be ear@@ ning an estimated $ 200 billion over the next decade , more than 10 times the sum western countries allocate each year to the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; aid industry &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; in the region .
because they are well aware of the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; cur@@ se of oil &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; - corruption , conflict , ecological disaster , and an@@ aes@@ theti@@ zed entrepreneur@@ ial spirit .
in ni@@ geri@@ a , an estimated $ 300 billion in oil revenues entered the government &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s coff@@ ers over the past 25 years , but per capita income remains less than one dollar a day for the simple reason that much of the money ends up in s@@ wis@@ s bank accounts , like the one owned by the late dict@@ ator san@@ i ab@@ ach@@ a .
as sc@@ andal@@ ous as it might be , these sums are mere pe@@ an@@ uts compared to the $ 4.@@ 5 billions in oil revenues sup@@ pose@@ dly si@@ ph@@ oned away from afri@@ can government coff@@ ers over the last decade .
afri@@ ca ’ s press : missing in action
in much of afri@@ ca , the challenge for journalists , editors , and readers goes beyond freedom of the press , and involves its very survival .
under ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s various dictator@@ ships , for example , many journalists under@@ went a rit@@ e of passage that most prefer to forget : routine har@@ ass@@ ment , be@@ at@@ ings , torture , fra@@ me@@ -@@ ups on sp@@ urious charges , and in@@ con@@ gru@@ ously long prison sent@@ ences .
among the numerous victims , perhaps the most bizar@@ re case was that of a young journalist named bag@@ au@@ da kal@@ th@@ o .
his body was found in a hotel toilet in the city of k@@ ad@@ una with the remains of a par@@ cel bom@@ b after an explo@@ sion that no one heard .
yet there he lay , and with a copy of my book the man died beside him .
the imp@@ lication , encouraged by the regime , was that kal@@ th@@ o was a recru@@ it of mine who ble@@ w himself up while preparing his next bom@@ b in a campaign of terror aimed at s@@ anni ab@@ ach@@ a ’ s dictatorship .
this un@@ consci@@ onable fabri@@ cation was fully exposed only after ab@@ ach@@ a ’ s death and the sp@@ ate of con@@ fes@@ sions that followed it by the police agents who actually committed the crime .
the press fought back ten@@ aci@@ ously , despite cas@@ u@@ alties .
journalists adopted tac@@ tics of underground publication , in the best tradition of east europ@@ ean sam@@ iz@@ dat .
when police ra@@ i@@ ded one place , copies emerged from other secure de@@ pots , to be sold in the streets by kam@@ i@@ ka@@ ze you@@ ths who dar@@ ted in and out of traffic offering the sub@@ ver@@ sive contra@@ band .
it did not matter that these you@@ thful ha@@ w@@ kers , some no more than seven or eight years old , were often arrested , be@@ aten , and locked up for weeks , occasionally months . when they emerged from prison , they returned to their dangerous work .
but ni@@ geri@@ a does not offer the premi@@ er example of the a@@ wes@@ ome power of the press . that honor belongs to a different history and region .
if bench@@ marks such as focus , mobili@@ zation , commitment , organization , and she@@ er impact are any guide , then the prize goes to the media ’ s bal@@ eful role in preparing the r@@ wand@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re of 1994 , and in direc@@ ting , over@@ seeing , and sto@@ king the fer@@ vor of the g@@ é@@ no@@ ci@@ da@@ ires once the ex@@ termination of tut@@ sis began .
it remains a so@@ ber@@ ing lesson , one that presents the media in the role of aggres@@ sor and viol@@ ator , in contrast to their normal position as victim .
what matters now is the role that the rest of the afri@@ can media should have played , and the questions that this raises about their capacity to function as a wat@@ ch@@ dog .
not many afri@@ cans , even among those who are knowled@@ ge@@ able in world affairs , had ever heard of radio mill@@ es col@@ lines , the most b@@ lat@@ ant instrument of the r@@ wand@@ an genocide .
it is ch@@ ast@@ ening that events primarily concerning afri@@ cans enter the public domain mainly owing to the intervention of the foreign media .
it was they who exposed the complic@@ ity of certain foreign powers in an ongoing crime against humanity .
and it was the foreign press that detailed the parallel failure of the united nations , whose agents were on the ground but whose in@@ ability to call genocide by its proper name led to a com@@ at@@ ose response .
simply put , the afri@@ can media failed to reach beyond immediate borders and serve as a voice for the continent in its en@@ coun@@ ters with the world .
the afri@@ can media ’ s response to the mass@@ acres and rap@@ es in dar@@ fur has been equally mut@@ ed .
once again , afri@@ can readers are being short@@ changed , remaining dependent on foreign re@@ por@@ tage in order to gras@@ p the enor@@ m@@ ity of what is transp@@ iring .
afri@@ can civil society , whose mou@@ th@@ piece is the press , cannot escape some measure of re@@ pro@@ ach for its failure to urge leaders to rescue fellow afri@@ cans .
from liber@@ ia to the con@@ go , the pre@@ di@@ ca@@ ment of the afri@@ can continent today demands that the press act not only as a wat@@ ch@@ dog , but as a go@@ ad .
it is to the media that the continent must look for an example of solidarity .
such solidarity should not be understood as something to be exercised only in times of conv@@ ul@@ sion .
the cheap recourse to dis@@ mis@@ sive inv@@ ec@@ tives such as “ outside interference , ” “ ja@@ un@@ di@@ ced reporting , ” and “ imperi@@ al mou@@ th@@ piece ” – so bel@@ o@@ ved by cor@@ rupt and / or repres@@ sive regimes – is recognized as self-@@ serving c@@ ant even by those who rout@@ inely mouth them .
afri@@ ca ’ s media must respond with its own analyses , explanations , and nar@@ rati@@ ves .
unfortunately , in repres@@ sive conditions such as those in , say , zim@@ babwe , third-@@ world journalists tend to take their cu@@ es from the conduct of their national leaders and close ranks around the continent ’ s ro@@ gue el@@ ep@@ han@@ ts .
this refle@@ x has left zim@@ babwe practically a journ@@ alis@@ m-@@ free zone , with only the foreign press seeking to hold president ro@@ bert mu@@ gabe to account .
im@@ itation appears to be a hall@@ mark of ty@@ rants in their exercise of power , so the absence of solidarity among afri@@ ca ’ s journalists and afri@@ ca ’ s peoples has created a dangerous vacuum .
today it is zim@@ babwe ’ s press that is under the gun .
tomorrow ?
we should all bear this in mind , for territorial ambition often goes hand in hand with the c@@ ens@@ or ’ s cre@@ ed .
afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s quest for power
civil war , fam@@ ine , disease , the legacy of col@@ oni@@ alis@@ m-@@ all have been advanced as plau@@ sible reasons for the continent &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s gr@@ in@@ ding poverty and economic back@@ war@@ dness .
but another fac@@ tor@@ -@@ probably related in some ways to these o@@ ther@@ s-@@ plays a fundamental role in sti@@ fl@@ ing development : a lack of modern energy sources .
afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s enormous energy potential remains v@@ ast@@ ly under exploited . this is a key conclusion of the 2003 / 2004 afri@@ can economic outlook , published recently by the o@@ ec@@ d .
while almost half of afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s 53 countries could prof@@ itably produce hydro@@ power , only 7 % of this potential is reached because of poor infrastructure and the high costs of initial investments .
furthermore , despite its large geo@@ thermal and solar energy potential , afri@@ ca accounts for only 1.3 % of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s installed solar facilities , and only four countries have started explo@@ iting underground heat sources .
of the fossil energy sources - primarily oil - that afri@@ can countries do exploit , only a quarter is consu@@ med locally .
limited energy development in afri@@ ca has resulted in one of the lowest uses of modern energy sources in the world .
more than three quarters of sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ cans have no access to electricity , compared to fewer than 14 % of l@@ atin ameri@@ cans and east asi@@ ans .
as a result , most afri@@ cans use biom@@ ass ( animal and vegetable wa@@ stes and fire@@ wood ) for lighting , cooking , and heating .
families in rural and semi-@@ rural areas often have no choice but to exploit what they perc@@ eive as a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; free &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; energy source .
however , as populations grow and the need for energy increases , fragile eco@@ systems are threatened .
replacing biom@@ ass sources by less destruc@@ tive energy supplies has thus become increasingly urgent .
clearly , afri@@ can countries , assisted by their development partners , need to develop the continent &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s enormous energy potential as an integral part of their efforts to sp@@ ur economic growth and reduce poverty .
improvements in energy supplies have multiple beneficial effects .
public and home lighting , refriger@@ ation of food , medicine and vacc@@ ines , and heating and proper sanit@@ ation help improve people &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s living conditions and health .
more and hig@@ her@@ -@@ quality energy increases production through moderni@@ zed communications , improved productivity , and a better business environment .
a secure energy supply , moreover , greatly extends learning possibilities and improves access to information .
more informed citizens , in turn , participate at a higher rate and to a greater degree in their country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s decision-making processes .
thus , institutions are ren@@ dered more democratic and governments become more transparent and responsible .
some countries have sought to bridge the gap between their energy potential and their populations &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; lack of access to energy .
in a few countries , priv@@ ate-@@ sector participation in electricity companies , coupled with new independent regulators , has resulted in greater and more efficient power generation and higher employment , while dou@@ bling the number of subscri@@ bers .
electri@@ fication for the rural poor has improved in south afri@@ ca and gh@@ ana through the creation of independent agencies in charge of implementing rural electri@@ fication plans .
similar policies need to be adopted by a greater number of countries to enable them to address their energy challenges in a more effective way .
more attention should also be given to regional and inter-@@ regional power initiatives , which can help smooth out the un@@ even distribution of energy resources across countries .
such reforms have the potential of benefiting consumers by lower@@ ing costs and improving the reliability and quality of services .
an integrated , contin@@ ent-@@ wide energy strategy , linked to national policies for growth would , indeed , go a long way toward addressing this important need .
one vehicle for promoting such an approach is the new partnership for afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s development ( ne@@ p@@ ad ) .
the ne@@ p@@ ad heads of states implementing committee has asked the afri@@ can development bank to take the lead in regional infrastructure ( including transport , energy , water , etc . ) and banking and financial standards .
as part of the work on regional infrastructure , the bank has developed a short-term action plan .
several projects , including some in the energy sector , have been prepared or are under preparation , and four have already been approved for financing by the bank .
projects and programs identified in the short-term action plan are estimated to cost $ 7 billion .
in addition , work has also started in preparing a medium to long-term action plan in close collaboration with the regional economic communities and in cooperation with the world bank and the europ@@ ean union .
the afri@@ can economic outlook estimates that afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s g@@ d@@ p growth in 2003 stood at 3.@@ 6 % , significantly higher than the 2.@@ 8 % recorded in 2002 .
projec@@ tions for 2004 indicate that faster growth is likely to continue , or even accelerate further , for the next two or three years .
but this is still not enough : it is generally acknowledged that average growth rates of around 6-@@ 8 % are required if afri@@ ca is to make real head@@ way in cur@@ tail@@ ing poverty .
more intensive use of afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s energy resources will necessarily be a critical component of any realistic development strategy .
as afri@@ ca looks to the future , developing its enormous energy resources - through both national and regional efforts - must be given high priority .
indeed , boosting its energy capacity will be critical to un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing the continent &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economic and human potential .
ensuring afri@@ ca ’ s continued rise
la@@ gos – afri@@ ca ’ s rise is in danger of fal@@ tering .
after years during which the continent ’ s economy grew at an average annual rate of 5 % , global uncertainty , de@@ pressed commodity prices , and j@@ it@@ ter@@ y external conditions are threatening to undermine decades of mu@@ ch-@@ needed progress .
ensuring the wealth and well@@ being of the continent ’ s residents will not be easy ; but there is much that policymakers can do to put afri@@ ca back on an up@@ ward tra@@ jec@@ tory .
first and foremost , policymakers must secure the financing needed to pursue sustainable development in an uncertain global environment .
the world bank estimates that afri@@ ca will require at least $ 93 billion a year to fund its infrastructure needs alone .
cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ friendly , sustainable infrastructure will cost even more .
and yet , as long as global growth remains weak , afri@@ cans cannot count on developed countries to fully honor their commitments to help at@@ tain the sustainable development goals .
afri@@ ca must rapidly develop its own resources , beginning by nearly dou@@ bling tax revenues .
across sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , tax revenues account for less than one-@@ fifth of g@@ d@@ p , compared to more than one-@@ third in o@@ ec@@ d countries .
this means there is plenty of room for improvement .
from 1990 to 2004 , for example , gh@@ ana reformed its tax system and raised revenues from 11 % to 22 % of g@@ d@@ p .
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , such progress is difficult ; in ni@@ geri@@ a , we saw an opportunity in raising non-@@ oil tax revenues , but strug@@ gl@@ ed to sei@@ ze it .
another source of domestic resources is the roughly $ 3@@ 80 billion in pension assets held by just ten afri@@ can countries .
policymakers should be le@@ ver@@ aging these considerable sums .
at the same time , afri@@ can countries will have to find a way to diversi@@ fy their economies .
diversification requires investment in the future , in the form of education and well-@@ developed infrastructure , including telecommunications , power , roads , rail , and water .
there are plenty of models to follow : du@@ bai , sin@@ ga@@ por@@ e , th@@ ail@@ and , mal@@ ay@@ sia , m@@ ex@@ ico , in@@ don@@ esia , and south korea are all ad@@ mi@@ red by afri@@ cans as economies that managed to transform themselves .
du@@ bai , for example , set out more than three decades ago to prepare for a future without oil .
the government implemented a step@@ -@@ by-@@ step transformation of the country into a service economy , putting in place the infrastructure and incentives necessary to build up financial services , tourism , medical services , real estate , media , arts , and culture .
south korea and sin@@ ga@@ por@@ e , which had few natural resources on which to rely , are no less inspir@@ ing .
the secret behind these countries ’ success is rel@@ ent@@ lessly focused leaders , whether entr@@ en@@ ched but ben@@ ign dict@@ ators or democratically elected politicians with a shared vision of a broad@@ -based economy .
sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca has paths for diversi@@ fied growth that many of the tra@@ il@@ bla@@ z@@ ers did not : valu@@ e-@@ added agriculture and ag@@ ro industry , the processing of mineral resources , pet@@ ro@@ chemical comple@@ xes , manufacturing of dur@@ able and consumer goods , tourism and entertainment , and an emerging inform@@ ation-@@ technology sector .
as the necessary measures for diversification are implemented , policymakers must ensure that the economic growth they are pursuing creates jobs .
sad@@ ly , this has not always been the case .
much of the recent growth has benefited only a few , leaving many behind – most notably young people and women .
from 2006 to 2013 , inequality rose in many of the continent ’ s most important economies , including south afri@@ ca , ni@@ geri@@ a , gh@@ ana , tan@@ z@@ ania , and r@@ wand@@ a .
these were challenges that we were starting to address in ni@@ geri@@ a when i was finance minister .
we knew that we needed not just to secure growth , but also to improve the quality of that growth .
to that end , policymakers must ensure that growth is chann@@ eled into sectors that create jobs , such as agriculture , manufacturing , and services .
they may also have to re@@ distribute income and strengthen social safety nets to protect better those at the bottom of the lad@@ der .
matching skills to job opportunities will be crucial .
some 70 % of afri@@ ca ’ s population is under 30 , and the continent is home to half the world ’ s pri@@ mar@@ y-@@ scho@@ ol-@@ age children who have been deprived of the opportunity to study .
offering afri@@ ca ’ s children basic reading , writing , and technology skills , as well as vocational , technical , and entrepreneur@@ ial training , must be a top priority .
weak heal@@ th-@@ care systems must also be strengthened in order to tackle the en@@ demic diseases that sa@@ p productivity , such as malaria , as well as improving prep@@ are@@ dness for out@@ breaks of dead@@ ly epide@@ m@@ ics .
the sta@@ kes are high .
the world bank estimates the eb@@ ola outbreak shr@@ ank the economies of si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , gu@@ ine@@ a , and liber@@ ia by 16 % .
as the world economy sp@@ ut@@ ters , afri@@ can countries will have to develop trade with one another .
in 2013 , afri@@ can goods and services accoun@@ ted for just 16 % of trade within the continent , and just over 3 % of world trade .
one problem is that most afri@@ can countries produce the same type of commodities and trade them with very little valu@@ e-@@ added .
policymakers must encourage greater speci@@ alization ; differenti@@ ated goods and services will add value and volume to trade .
logistics pose another obstacle to in@@ tra-@@ afri@@ can trade .
policymakers must make it easier to move goods across borders , by improving connec@@ tivity between countries and reducing bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and administrative costs .
for example , road transport tariffs across afri@@ ca are estimated at $ 0.@@ 0@@ 5@@ - $ 0.@@ 13 per t@@ on-@@ kilom@@ eter , compared to the average of $ 0.@@ 0@@ 1@@ - $ 0.@@ 05 for all developing countries .
the ri@@ ft valley railway project , which will eventually link mom@@ bas@@ a on the ken@@ yan coast to kamp@@ ala in ug@@ anda , is a good example of the benefits that investments in transportation could provide .
the afri@@ can development bank estimates that it will double the volume of trade between the two countries , while reducing margin@@ al costs by 30 % .
as they make these investments , policymakers must not forget that much of afri@@ ca ’ s recent growth can be credi@@ ted to good macroeconomic policies and sound economic management .
extending the continent ’ s rise will require strengthening the continent ’ s economic fundament@@ als .
this means ensuring that prices in the economy are correct , starting with the exchange rate .
some countries may need temporary controls to cur@@ b damaging capital out@@ flows , but policymakers should aim for a market-@@ based exchange rate and a solid plan for governing inflation , debt , foreign@@ -@@ exchange reserves , current accounts , and fiscal balances .
afri@@ ca ’ s potential can hardly be over@@ stated .
the continent is well placed to build diversi@@ fied economies based on low-@@ carbon , sustainable infrastructure .
but policymakers cannot simply assume that afri@@ ca ’ s rise will continue .
they must take the right steps to ensure that it does .
nai@@ rob@@ i – when i met e@@ uni@@ ce wan@@ gar@@ i at a nai@@ rob@@ i coffee shop recently , i was surprised to hear her on her mobile phone , insist@@ ently asking her mother about the progress of a cor@@ n field in her home village , hours away from the big city .
a nur@@ se , wan@@ gar@@ i counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land – for more farming .
even though wan@@ gar@@ i lives in ken@@ ya ’ s capital , she is able to re@@ ap hundreds of dollars a year in profit from cash crops grown with the help of rel@@ atives .
her initial stake – drawn from her nur@@ sing wages of about $ 350 a month – has long since been recovered .
wan@@ gar@@ i is one of thousands of urban workers in ken@@ ya – and one of hundreds of thousands , even millions , across afri@@ ca – who are increasing their incomes through absen@@ tee agriculture .
with prices for basic foodstuffs at their highest levels in decades , many urban@@ ites feel well rewar@@ ded by farming .
across afri@@ ca , political leaders , long dis@@ mis@@ sive of rural concerns , have aw@@ ak@@ ened to the importance of agriculture and the role that educated people , even those living in major cities , can play in farming .
in ni@@ geri@@ a , former president ol@@ use@@ gun ob@@ as@@ an@@ jo has a huge diversi@@ fied farm and has pushed for policies to help absen@@ tee farmers prosp@@ er .
in ug@@ anda , vice president gil@@ bert bu@@ ken@@ ya rout@@ inely tra@@ vels the country , promoting hig@@ her@@ -@@ value farming , such as dairy production .
perhaps the most visible political support for absen@@ tee agriculture is in liber@@ ia , a small west afri@@ can country where civil war destroyed agriculture , ren@@ dering the population dependent on food imports , even today .
president j@@ oh@@ n@@ son@@ -@@ si@@ r@@ lea@@ f , recogni@@ zing that educated people could contribute much to an agriculture revi@@ val , launched her “ back to the soil ” campaign in jun@@ e 2008 in large part to encourage urban d@@ well@@ ers to farm .
to be sure , absen@@ tee farming by el@@ ites and educated urban workers can ’ t solve all of afri@@ ca ’ s urgent food needs .
because they don ’ t visit their fields often , they rely heavily on rel@@ atives and friends . when i decided to farm whe@@ at for the first time this spring on le@@ ased land in my childhood village , my mother agreed to super@@ vise p@@ lowing , plan@@ ting , and har@@ vest@@ ing .
without her help , i might not have far@@ med at all .
even with mother ’ s help , i have wor@@ ries .
although i grew up around whe@@ at fields , my knowledge of farming is thin .
fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er and spra@@ ying were both more expensive than i thought .
while my whe@@ at stal@@ ks are s@@ pro@@ uting on schedule , i now fear that at har@@ vest time – in nov@@ ember – prices will fall and i won ’ t rec@@ ou@@ p my costs .
one key tool is the mobile phone .
my hopes for success are bu@@ o@@ yed by my ability to call my mother in@@ exp@@ en@@ sively and discuss the farm .
we even decided over the phone what kind of pesti@@ cide to use and which trac@@ tor company to hire .
because they know both the ta@@ stes of fellow city d@@ well@@ ers and rural conditions , many urban farmers are succ@@ ee@@ ding .
in fact , some city d@@ well@@ ers don ’ t even bo@@ ther with acqu@@ iring land or gaining distant help .
certain crops can be grown in their own homes .
j@@ ames mem@@ us@@ i , an accoun@@ tant , gro@@ ws mus@@ h@@ rooms in a spare bedroom , selling them to nearby hotels and super@@ markets .
nevertheless , most people living in afri@@ ca ’ s cities have access to land in the countryside , which is why liber@@ ia ’ s government rightly highlights the potential for farm expansion .
in a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer , the authorities declared , “ the soil is a bank ; invest in it . ”
in liber@@ ia , the main push is to reduce imports of st@@ ap@@ les such as rice and tom@@ ato@@ es .
in more prosperous countries , afri@@ can el@@ ites are motivated by a complex inter@@ play of national pride , di@@ etary concerns , and the pursuit of profit .
in z@@ ambi@@ a , for example , sy@@ l@@ va b@@ anda ign@@ ited a cra@@ ze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants .
now , ordinary lus@@ ak@@ ans want to co@@ ok similar meals in their own homes , driving demand for farmers who produce such de@@ lic@@ acies as dri@@ ed p@@ ump@@ kin , “ black jack ” leaves , and fresh ok@@ ra .
simil@@ arly , in nai@@ rob@@ i , mir@@ ingo kin@@ y@@ an@@ ju@@ i , another woman entreprene@@ ur , is supplying un@@ refined – and more nutri@@ tious – ma@@ ize and whe@@ at fl@@ our .
in another move to distinguish her ingredients from western versions , kin@@ y@@ an@@ ju@@ i also s@@ ells through gro@@ cer@@ y stores fl@@ our fla@@ vo@@ red with am@@ ar@@ athan , a green vegetable that gro@@ ws around ken@@ ya .
the revi@@ val of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations .
last year , uni@@ le@@ ver ’ s ken@@ yan branch ran a “ taste our culture ” campaign in support of its line of traditional east afri@@ can her@@ bs and spices .
such campaigns go hand@@ -in-@@ hand with expanded farming , because s@@ ellers of these foods prefer nearby gro@@ wers – even if these gro@@ wers increasingly live in the city .
building afri@@ ca ’ s scientific talent
tor@@ onto – ten years ago , south afri@@ can physi@@ c@@ ist nei@@ l t@@ uro@@ k made a bold pre@@ diction : the world ’ s next ein@@ stein will be from afri@@ ca .
a decade later , it is worth considering whether the continent is any closer to finding the next global geni@@ us .
statisti@@ cally , there is indeed a high prob@@ ability that it will happen .
by 2050 , 40 % of the world ’ s young people will be afri@@ can .
by virtu@@ e of demo@@ graphics alone , it stands to reason that afri@@ ca is dest@@ ined to generate pro@@ di@@ gi@@ es in science or technology .
afri@@ cans have led the world in science before .
in fact , some of humanity ’ s greatest innovations – from vacc@@ ines to brain surgery – were pione@@ ered by afri@@ cans .
one of the oldest measuring devices ever used , the leb@@ om@@ bo bone , was car@@ ved by people believed to have lived some 35@@ ,000 years ago in modern@@ -@@ day es@@ wat@@ ini ( s@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and ) .
in other words , mathemati@@ cs itself is an afri@@ can in@@ vention .
for decades , science and policy l@@ umin@@ aries like cal@@ est@@ ous j@@ uma , a global advocate for sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ driven sustainable development , and wan@@ gar@@ i ma@@ ath@@ ai , an environmental activ@@ ist and no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate , champi@@ oned afri@@ ca ’ s science agenda .
with these vision@@ aries now gone , afri@@ ca needs a new brain trust to in@@ sp@@ ire future generations of ethical and public-@@ spir@@ ited researchers .
but how do we ensure afri@@ ca dis@@ covers , supports , and develops innovative , gam@@ e-@@ changing scientists ?
the missing element has been an afri@@ can education system that supports innovation in research , and that provides the next afri@@ can revolutionary scienti@@ st with the training and support he or she needs – in afri@@ ca .
across the continent , there is a growing consensus among governments that education and research in science , technology , engineering , and mathemati@@ cs ( stem ) is critical for economic growth and development .
at the moment , however , too many of afri@@ ca ’ s young researchers see no option but to go abroad for school and work .
that can change , but only with concrete investments in home@@ grown talent .
this means re@@ thinking the entire education system in afri@@ ca .
three priorities stand out .
first , afri@@ can countries need to fix the knowledge pipeline .
that means investing in teacher training , improved learning outcomes , retention of girls in stem courses , supporting research earlier in university , helping young researchers through so-called sand@@ wich programs , establishing univer@@ sit@@ y-@@ private sector lab@@ s on camp@@ us , and more .
second , afri@@ ca needs indigenous knowledge creation .
this requires facilitating both fundamental and applied research and creating the necessary infrastructure for the dissemination of research outcomes .
this could include making more funding available to researchers and research institutions , as well as promoting open sources for knowledge sharing .
the third priority is putting knowledge into practice .
this could involve making scientific information accessible to the general public and innov@@ ators , and supporting public-@@ private partnerships to pilot , demonstrate , and apply research outcomes , thereby creating jobs addressing public problems .
a good example is zipl@@ ine , which deplo@@ ys dr@@ one technology to deliver blood trans@@ fu@@ sions to remote areas of r@@ wand@@ a .
to deplo@@ y this technology , which is based on ameri@@ can research but pil@@ o@@ ted in-@@ country , zipl@@ ine signed agreements with the aviation authority and the ministr@@ y of health , among others , and a public-@@ private partnership was set up to fund the program .
after successfully deplo@@ ying the technology in r@@ wand@@ a , it is currently being rolled out in gh@@ ana .
zipl@@ ine has saved hundreds of lives and demonstrated the potential of technology transfer with large-scale impact .
the next ein@@ stein forum ( ne@@ f ) , an initiative of the afri@@ can institute for mathemati@@ cal sciences ( aims ) and the bra@@ in@@ child of t@@ uro@@ k , supported partly by the master@@ card foundation , is demonstrating that afri@@ ca produces strong scientific talent .
the ne@@ f focuses on conven@@ ing afri@@ ca ’ s innov@@ ators to highlight break@@ through dis@@ cover@@ ies and cataly@@ ze scientific collaboration for human development .
since the first co@@ h@@ ort of ne@@ f fel@@ lows was selected in 2015 , the program has highlighted the contributions of young afri@@ can researchers who are working to tackle some of the world ’ s tou@@ gh@@ est scientific and technological challenges .
with so many complex issues v@@ ying for attention today , afri@@ ca will need innovative education and research models .
but as long as the ne@@ f and similar efforts continue to nur@@ ture the continent ’ s bri@@ gh@@ test young scientists and tackle system@@ ic issues like funding , mobility , and research infrastructure , the od@@ ds are good that those leading the search for solutions will be the very people t@@ uro@@ k predic@@ ted .
improving afri@@ can women ’ s health through financial inclusion
acc@@ ra – in late oc@@ tober , the world health organization ’ s regional office for afri@@ ca signed an agreement with the united nations international telec@@ ommunic@@ ation union ( it@@ u ) .
the aim of the unlikely partnership is to encourage the use of digital services “ to save lives and improve people ’ s health . ”
but perhaps the pact ’ s most innovative feature is the vo@@ w to mer@@ ge financial inclusion strategies with modern heal@@ th-@@ care delivery .
financial inclusion is a proven path@@ way to improving people ’ s health , especially the health of women in developing countries .
women who can easily access bank accounts or cash payment options tend to invest more in their businesses and families . in turn , they live health@@ ier , more satis@@ fying lives .
yet , too often , initiatives like the one signed in oc@@ tober focus on one or the other – e-@@ health or financial products like insurance .
because afri@@ cans ’ ability to earn and save money can be the difference between good care and no care at all , this represents a missed opportunity to help patients and build more re@@ sili@@ ent communities .
the cost of this choice is dis@@ proportion@@ ately high for afri@@ ca ’ s women .
in ni@@ geri@@ a , for example , 400@@ ,000 women live with ob@@ st@@ et@@ ric f@@ ist@@ ula , a dis@@ abling condition often caused by comp@@ lications in child@@ birth .
in tan@@ z@@ ania , some 8@@ ,000 women die annually during pregn@@ ancy or delivery ; most of these deaths could be prevented .
and , across the continent , women ’ s life expec@@ tan@@ cy at birth is just 58 years , compared to more than 80 years in developed countries .
progress is being made to connect women ’ s health solutions and financial inclusion .
at a recent conference in dar es sal@@ a@@ am , experts from the technology and financial services sector joined investors , phil@@ an@@ throp@@ ists , and development specialists to de@@ vise ways to make finance work for afri@@ ca ’ s women .
through programs like these , development experts can advocate for digital solutions as a means of social and financial em@@ power@@ ment .
unfortunately , cooperation like the pact signed in oc@@ tober is the exception , rather than the nor@@ m .
banks , regulators , finance min@@ istri@@ es , and telecommunications companies all frequently gather to consider financial inclusion without the local and global health community .
this must change if we are to build more inclusive platforms for afri@@ can patients and clients .
the first step is to identify missed opportunities .
a big one st@@ ems from the dispar@@ ate approaches to bringing financial services and di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ed health care to rural parts of afri@@ ca .
at the moment , banks and mobile network operators are working to expand their digital banking services to un@@ ban@@ ked and under-@@ ban@@ ked clients .
at the same time , community health workers ( ch@@ ws ) are operating in these regions to prevent , treat , and refer patients to clin@@ ics .
combining these efforts makes sense , because both initiatives rely heavily on trust .
through pre-@@ established networks , ch@@ ws could au@@ gment their e-@@ health offer@@ ings with financial products , like mobile cash payment systems .
bro@@ a@@ dening digital disease management and access to health information to include financial well@@ being would create natural synergies .
while there are some concerns that adding responsibilities to ch@@ ws could undermine heal@@ th-@@ care quality , a frag@@ mented approach to prosperity is even more damaging .
once opportunities for expansion are identified , other issues will need to be addressed before women ’ s health and financial inclusion programs can be wi@@ dened .
for star@@ ters , a lack of sex@@ -@@ dis@@ aggreg@@ ated data makes it difficult to draft policies based on health quality and financial need .
although some countries , such as bur@@ undi and sen@@ egal , are working to improve their gen@@ der-@@ specific data collection , a broader , more coordinated push is needed .
raising the region ’ s financial liter@@ acy will be another challenge .
the ability to understand and execute matters of personal finance is the weak@@ est link in trans@@ forming women ’ s opportunities through financial inclusion .
moreover , financial liter@@ acy is a pre-@@ requ@@ isite for the roll@@ out of financing initiatives , such as programs that support wom@@ en-@@ led small and micro-@@ enterprises .
if financial liter@@ acy levels can be raised , women can access resources such as land and credit , tools that hold the keys to business development , social mobility , and personal growth .
progress has been made in le@@ vel@@ ing the playing field , but these gains must be sustained .
the agreement between the who and the it@@ u will help promote wealth creation in parts of afri@@ ca where access to health care and financial services is lacking .
to maintain this momentum , deeper commitments are needed , especially from the global health community .
but , however afri@@ can governments proceed in di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing their health and financial services offer@@ ings , women ’ s needs must remain at the center of any solution .
closing the youth ap@@ ath@@ y gap
nai@@ rob@@ i – when the united nations ’ member countries adopted the sustainable development goals two years ago , they committed themselves to reduce substantially “ the proportion of youth not in employment , education , or training . ”
that commitment will be virtually impossible to ful@@ fill , unless political participation by young people increases considerably .
young people are critical to progress .
as us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama put it in a 2015 speech in nai@@ rob@@ i , “ no country can achieve its full potential unless it draws on the tal@@ ents of all its people . ” and youth now comp@@ rise a large share of those people – 18 % of the world ’ s population , to be precise .
the share is even larger in much of the developing world .
the medi@@ an age of afri@@ ca ’ s population is just 19.@@ 5 years .
given their numbers , not to mention rising education and liter@@ acy rates , young people can make a world of difference , shaping political dis@@ course and electoral outcomes .
but that requires them to be engaged and active .
in the united king@@ dom , most young people wish to remain in the europ@@ ean union .
as a l@@ ord ash@@ cro@@ ft pol@@ l showed , 73 % of those aged 18-@@ 24 , and 62 % of those aged 25-@@ 34 , voted accordingly in last year ’ s referendum .
but most young bri@@ tish did not actually show up to cast their votes , allowing the uk ’ s older , predomin@@ antly pro-@@ bre@@ x@@ it co@@ h@@ orts to win the day .
pre@@ sum@@ ably having learned their lesson from the bre@@ x@@ it referendum , young b@@ rit@@ ons contributed to an un@@ expected victory for labour in jun@@ e ’ s s@@ na@@ p general election .
in ken@@ ya ’ s presidential election , held last month , 51 % of registered voters were below the age of 35 years .
although the su@@ preme court annul@@ led the results and ordered a fresh vote , owing to electoral irregularities and illeg@@ alities , large numbers of young people are likely to turn out again .
unfortunately , ken@@ ya is the exception that proves the rule .
political ap@@ ath@@ y among young people , like that seen in the bre@@ x@@ it referendum , remains per@@ va@@ sive worldwide .
in many regions of afri@@ ca , for example , young people are dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ed with politics , convinced that weal@@ thy older people will always prevail and advance their own interests , often at the expense of younger generations .
this sense of dis@@ em@@ power@@ ment is threatening to turn the developing world ’ s youth bul@@ ge into a youth cur@@ se – with serious potential consequences .
the ar@@ ab spring u@@ pris@@ ings , which led to violence and instability in most affected countries , were fu@@ eled largely by desper@@ ate young people demanding rights and opportunities .
to avoid such outcomes , young people need to be part of their countries ’ political life , able to advance their own vision of the future .
as young ken@@ y@@ ans repeated during the recent election campaign , “ if you are not at the table , you are on the menu . ”
so what can be done to increase political awareness and participation among young people ?
in ken@@ ya , government efforts have focused on the creation of three institutions : the ministr@@ y of public service , youth , and gender affairs , the youth enterprise development fund , and the national youth council .
though somewhat d@@ ys@@ functional , these institutions have helped to em@@ power ken@@ yan youth , driving the high election turn@@ out last month .
but perhaps the most effective approach to closing the ap@@ ath@@ y gap focuses on initiatives led by young people themselves .
in ni@@ geri@@ a , young people sp@@ ear@@ headed the not too young to run campaign , which led to a constitutional amendment lower@@ ing the minimum age for candidates .
their success inspired a global campaign to support young people ’ s right to run for office .
in ken@@ ya , the you@@ th-@@ led ji@@ activate – the name , which combines s@@ wah@@ il@@ i and english , means “ activate yourself ” – has sought to boost youth participation in politics by highlighting the main issues affecting young people .
ji@@ activate , in which i am engaged as national chair@@ person , aims to serve as a platform that amp@@ li@@ fies young ken@@ y@@ ans ’ voices , offering them easier ways to take action .
to in@@ sp@@ ire more such initiatives , there must be a deliber@@ ate effort to engage with youth in a way that supports real political engagement , not to@@ ken@@ ism and empty rhetoric .
to that end , the organisation of afri@@ ca youth , of which i am coordin@@ ator , has not only worked with local youth groups and community networks ; it has also taken lessons from a ge@@ op@@ oll survey of 2@@ ,000 urban and rural ken@@ yan youth .
that survey showed that , while 27 % of respon@@ dents had never engaged politically , 26 % had attended an event and 34 % had posted on social media .
moreover , 68 % of respon@@ dents said that they would participate in political action only if they had access to a safe and tru@@ sted platform that would protect them from vic@@ tim@@ ization , intim@@ id@@ ation , or re@@ prim@@ and .
one lesson than can be drawn from these data is the potential value of social media , which , despite being constra@@ ined in many countries during elections , remains a po@@ tent tool to facilitate youth political engagement .
for example , by cre@@ atively using social media to collect , coll@@ ate , and amp@@ li@@ fy young people ’ s priorities in the ken@@ yan elections , ji@@ activate helped sp@@ ur their interest in politics .
nonetheless , many ken@@ y@@ ans who were popular on social media did not make much of an impact on the election ’ s outcome .
transl@@ ating social media energy into effective action in the real world remains a da@@ un@@ ting challenge .
increasing youth involvement in politics will require sustained commitment and hard work .
but , far from a deter@@ rent , this should serve as a powerful incentive to get started .
no one is more affected by past , present , and future policies than young people .
they must take their seat at the table , not wait until one is offered .
the transform@@ ative power of afri@@ ca ’ s youth
tor@@ onto – a few years ago , during a convers@@ ation with young people from some of sen@@ egal ’ s poorest communities , a pair of social entrepreneurs told me about projects they were working on to help their pe@@ ers succeed .
one young man said he planned to put more computers into primary schools ; another had set up a network to connect rural job seekers in the urban t@@ umul@@ t of dak@@ ar , sen@@ egal ’ s capital .
after they finished sharing their plans , i congratul@@ ated them , and said that their parents must be very proud .
but instead of accepting the compli@@ ment , they dem@@ urred . “ my parents are against what i ’ m doing , ” they said , almost in un@@ ison , before expla@@ ining that young people face family pressure to get a government job or use their english skills to work as a tour guide – not to become a ris@@ k-@@ taking entreprene@@ ur .
for ambitious young afri@@ cans , there are many obstacles to success .
the journey to a job – whether formal or informal , entrepreneur@@ ial or traditional – is often a sol@@ it@@ ary one .
many young people lack access to skills training or even a favor@@ able social environment to try something new .
as i was reminded that day in sen@@ egal , helping young people find ga@@ in@@ ful employment is the most important thing that the international community can do to help afri@@ ca develop .
in about 25 years , those young people will be part of the biggest workforce in the world , with more than 1.1 billion people of working age .
by some forecasts , 11 million people will enter afri@@ ca ’ s labor market each year for the next decade , most of whom will be first-@@ time job seekers .
if afri@@ can countries boost job growth and equi@@ p young people with emplo@@ yable skills , this youth bul@@ ge can deliver rapid , inclusive , and sustainable economic growth to the continent .
in turn , millions would have the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty .
but afri@@ ca cannot achieve this future alone .
at the master@@ card foundation , we believe that , if afri@@ ca is to reach its potential , gaps in two keys areas must be closed .
the first area is access to financial products and services .
according to the world bank , some two billion people around the world currently lack such access .
in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , just 34 % of adults have a bank account , making it difficult for people to put money aside for un@@ planned events , like a bad har@@ vest , or to save for school .
this must change , with afri@@ cans gaining not only better access to banking systems , but also improved financial liter@@ acy .
the second key challenge that must be addressed is exclusion from secondary and higher education .
while progress has been made in some regions , only about one-@@ third of afri@@ ca ’ s young people gradu@@ ate from high school .
girls are particularly disadvantaged ; according to un@@ esco , in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , an estimated nine million girls under the age of 11 have never been to school , compared to six million boys .
to address these issues , the master@@ card foundation has established partnerships with local organizations to design education and finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ liter@@ acy programs aimed at helping young people find and keep jobs .
by building a bet@@ ter-@@ trained workforce , the foundation ’ s programs are helping to em@@ power the next generation of afri@@ ca ’ s community members and leaders , so that they can help their families , communities , and countries achieve a bri@@ ghter and more prosperous future .
already , a new generation of educated and ethical entrepreneurs , like those i met in sen@@ egal , is emerging across afri@@ ca , demonstrating a profound commitment to building a stronger afri@@ ca .
for example , when i ask young people participating in our schol@@ ars program what they plan to do with their new skills , they almost always reply that after getting a job , they plan to help som@@ ebo@@ dy else , by returning to their secondary schools to serve as ment@@ ors to younger students .
some of our program ’ s gradu@@ ates have even established community projects in their villages to address hi@@ v / aids or to build shel@@ ters for or@@ ph@@ ans and young children .
every one of these bright young afri@@ cans – examples of what the master@@ card foundation calls “ transform@@ ative leadership ” in action – has the potential to drive change in their own countries and communities .
those of us working in the field of international development can help level the playing field even more , by giving young afri@@ cans from all back@@ grounds an opportunity to lead in transform@@ ative ways .
if we succeed , afri@@ ca ’ s dre@@ am@@ ers of today will be the cat@@ al@@ yst@@ s of positive change tomorrow .
addi@@ s ab@@ aba – afri@@ ca has the yo@@ ung@@ est population in the world , and it ’ s growing fast .
by 20@@ 55 , the continent ’ s youth population ( aged 15-@@ 24 ) , is expected to be more than double the 2015 total of 226 million .
yet the continent remains stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly in@@ hosp@@ itable – politically , economically , and socially – to young people .
the success of afri@@ can governments ’ efforts to address this will be the single most important factor determining whether the continent prosp@@ ers or suff@@ ers in the coming decades .
a busin@@ ess-@@ as-@@ usual approach would risk ex@@ posing afri@@ ca not only to economic under@@ performance and a brain dra@@ in , but also to crimin@@ ality , political and social un@@ rest , and even armed conflict .
but afri@@ ca can thri@@ ve if its governments act now to tap the energy and dynam@@ ism of the bur@@ ge@@ oning youth population .
what is needed is a comprehensive policy agenda , comprising demo@@ graph@@ ically informed measures that address political , cultural , and economic exclusion in a synchron@@ ized manner .
this will be no small fe@@ at , not least because of the massive age gap between afri@@ ca ’ s young majority and their leaders : the average age of an afri@@ can president is 62 , while the medi@@ an age of afri@@ ca ’ s population is 19.@@ 5 .
that is the world ’ s largest age gap between govern@@ ors and the governed , and it raises concerns about how well decision-@@ makers understand the needs and aspirations of young people .
it does not help that a tradition of ger@@ on@@ to@@ c@@ racy prev@@ ails in many countries , meaning that young people ’ s political participation and influence is restricted on cultural grounds .
to help overcome this barrier , governments should treat gener@@ ational inequality with the same sense of urgency as other forms of inequality , acceler@@ ating efforts to introduce youth quotas for political parties , parliaments , and other decision-making institutions .
much work also remains to be done on the economic front .
according to the afri@@ can development bank , 12 million young people entered afri@@ ca ’ s labor force in 2015 , but only 3.1 million jobs were created .
that means that millions of young people were left without a stake in the economy .
in the short and medium term , it will be virtually impossible to create enough jobs to meet the needs of the unemployed and vulner@@ ably employed .
afri@@ ca does not have a large lab@@ or-@@ intensive manufacturing sector to absor@@ b its mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oming young population .
but there are programs that can help .
for example , you@@ th@@ con@@ ne@@ kt afri@@ ca , launched by the united nations development programme and the government of r@@ wand@@ a , encourages you@@ th-@@ friendly policies , such as access to finance and skills development , that match the needs of the market in particular countries .
still , given the de@@ ar@@ th of opportunities at home , many young afri@@ cans view migration as a chance for social mobility .
yet , as the ce@@ o of a major company based in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca recently la@@ mented to me , acqu@@ iring work visas for afri@@ cans is extremely difficult .
in fact , it can be easier to get a work visa for a bri@@ tish citizen than for , say , a gh@@ an@@ a@@ ian with the same skills .
afri@@ ca ’ s vision for economic integration , as set out in the afri@@ can union ’ s agenda 20@@ 63 , cannot be realized without labor migration that creates afri@@ can care@@ ers paths for young people .
it is telling that so many afri@@ cans are willing to risk dro@@ wn@@ ing in the medi@@ terranean sea , living in app@@ alling detention centers in north afri@@ ca , or sleeping in public parks in europ@@ ean cities , rather than remaining in afri@@ ca .
yet , contrary to popular belief , young people are not mig@@ rating from afri@@ ca exclusively for economic reasons .
rather , they are motivated by the promise of opportunities for genuine self-@@ improvement and the freedom to decide who to be and how to live .
that is certainly what led me to leave afri@@ ca and head to europ@@ e at a young age .
in fact , the desire for self-@@ improvement through migration is a key element of the human story – one that no desert , sea , or artificial barrier has been able to qu@@ ell .
political and cultural exclusion intensi@@ fies it .
given this , any strategy that does not address the broader environment of margin@@ alization is a bridge to no@@ where .
so far , afri@@ ca seems to be sle@@ ep@@ walking into a future of lost opportunity and , potentially , serious instability .
and afri@@ ca ’ s international partners have remained pre@@ occupied with containing migration from the continent , rather than addressing its underlying causes .
but there may be reason for hope .
the fifth europ@@ ean uni@@ on-@@ afri@@ ca summit , to be held later this year , will focus squ@@ are@@ ly on the continent ’ s young people .
likewise , the afri@@ can union ’ s theme for 2017 is “ har@@ ness@@ ing the demographic divi@@ dend through investments in youth . ”
one hopes that the growing recognition of the need to create opportunities for young people leads to effective , solidar@@ ity-@@ based initiatives that address the barriers to youth em@@ power@@ ment on the continent , instead of er@@ ec@@ ting barriers to prevent young people from leaving .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king , afri@@ ca confron@@ ts the fi@@ erce urgency of now .
there is such a thing as being too late .
nai@@ rob@@ i – afri@@ ca is in the midst of a youth employment crisis .
by 20@@ 35 , some 350 million new jobs will be needed , and agriculture , the continent ’ s biggest industry , could provide the bulk of them .
but at the moment , young afri@@ cans are sh@@ un@@ ning life on the farm for work in the city .
if afri@@ ca ’ s employment gap is to be closed , agri@@ businesses must find ways to recru@@ it younger hands .
this challenge was the focus of my research as part of the youth think tank , a you@@ th-@@ led research initiative in partnership with rest@@ less development ug@@ anda and the master@@ card foundation .
in a recent report , we examined the experiences of young afri@@ can agri@@ cultur@@ alists in seven countries .
and what we discovered is that the best way to enti@@ ce young people back to the farm is by improving access to and engagement with emerging technologies .
many of the young people with whom we spoke said that their biggest obstacle to a career in farming is learning the digital and technical skills necessary to succeed in today ’ s agricultural market .
with technologies like cl@@ oud comp@@ uting , soil sensors , and weather d@@ ron@@ es changing how food is produced , pack@@ aged , and distributed , digital liter@@ acy is as important as ar@@ able land and high-quality seeds .
it stands to reason , then , that if more young people could master digital skills , more would find work in the field .
to understand how important technology is to the young afri@@ can far@@ mer , consider competition for land .
most farm@@ land is acquired through her@@ edi@@ tary or commun@@ al distribution systems , and when new p@@ lots are allocated , they are typically smaller than those provided to previous generations .
to remain profitable , younger gro@@ wers must produce larger crops from smaller spaces , which requires innovation .
our study found that in many cases , the best solutions for young farmers are already being designed by young people .
for example , in ken@@ ya , one vegetable gro@@ wer turned her kitchen garden into a vertical farm to increase its output .
today , she runs her own business designing , fabri@@ c@@ ating , and installing similar structures for a variety of customers .
another inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e created a mobile app to help farmers connect with local seed and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er suppliers .
unfortunately , these types of you@@ th-@@ driven innovations rarely receive the necessary political or financial backing to make them viable and sc@@ al@@ able .
despite having great ideas , most young agricultural innov@@ ators do not feel supported in their efforts .
young people can help solve afri@@ ca ’ s unemployment challenges , but those closest to the problem have yet to be made part of the solution .
our research suggests several strategies to achieve this outcome .
for star@@ ters , young people need places to engage with lik@@ e-@@ minded innov@@ ators .
recogni@@ zing this , policymakers and the private sector should work together to create inc@@ ub@@ ation centers and ide@@ ation h@@ ub@@ s to help young people build , discuss , and access far@@ m-@@ related technologies .
moreover , those who promote new farm technologies should travel to the places where young people gather , to provide hand@@ s-@@ on , au@@ dien@@ ce-@@ specific training .
if the newest farm g@@ ad@@ gets and tools are mark@@ eted only on social media , as is often the case , up@@ take in rural areas will remain weak .
next , young people need access to financial products and services to help them turn their ideas into market@@ able businesses .
and , finally , countries must find ways to involve their youth in early stages of the techn@@ olog@@ y-@@ development pipeline .
as the experience of the ken@@ yan gar@@ dener illustr@@ ates , young people are often the best judges of what will deliver long-term , practical results .
last year , i had the privi@@ lege of presenting these findings at the global youth economic opportunities summit in wash@@ ington , d@@ c .
i spoke about the role young people play in afri@@ ca ’ s economy , and the importance of so@@ lic@@ iting their views on the future of afri@@ can agriculture .
it was an important first step in bringing young peoples ’ ideas to the table .
but much work remains to be done .
according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations , the average age of an afri@@ can far@@ mer today is about 60 , while 60 % of the population is under the age of 24 .
to brea@@ the new life into afri@@ ca ’ s farms , the entire industry must innov@@ ate .
and , as our research shows , the best way to do that is by working much more closely with those who have the most to gain from progress .
after ar@@ af@@ at
y@@ asi@@ r ar@@ af@@ at appears , once again , to have held off challenges to his rule .
but his latest victory does not answer the question of what will happen when he finally does leave the political scene .
when ar@@ af@@ at was seriously ill in 2003 , pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans were near pan@@ ic .
ah@@ mad du@@ din , former fat@@ ah leader in heb@@ ron , summ@@ ed up the di@@ lemma this way : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the pal@@ est@@ inian authority has always been a one-@@ man operation .
ar@@ af@@ at never really agreed to share power .
that is the problem . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
not only does ar@@ af@@ at have no designated successor , but he has crip@@ pled the creation of institutions that could provide for a smooth transition , develop new leaders , medi@@ ate disputes among competing candidates and fac@@ tions , or check the power of a future dict@@ ator .
but at some point , ar@@ af@@ at will de@@ part .
he is 74 years old , and cannot be described as healthy .
ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ability to symbo@@ li@@ ze the pal@@ est@@ inian cause throughout the world has wor@@ n thin in recent years , but any successor would be more ob@@ sc@@ ure .
so what will happen when a transition is forced on the pal@@ est@@ inian movement by his dem@@ ise ?
the best way to address that question is to focus not on who , but on what , would replace ar@@ af@@ at .
in a certain sense , ar@@ af@@ at is the pal@@ est@@ inian authority ( pa ) .
as a pro-@@ reform fat@@ ah official put it : &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; this is ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism . and we are all suffering from it .
i am afraid the pal@@ est@@ inian people will still be suffering from it even after his death . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s departure will leave a vacuum that no other institution or leader will be able to fill .
indeed , ar@@ af@@ at has had several roles , and in each of them his stat@@ ure has been unique .
while nomin@@ ally the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans have a collective leadership , the reality is that ar@@ af@@ at has overwhelming control .
he has been the pal@@ est@@ inian movement &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s sole leader almost from the day he founded it in 195@@ 9 .
other conten@@ ders , like ab@@ u ji@@ had and ab@@ u i@@ y@@ ad , were ass@@ assin@@ ated , and fa@@ is@@ al al-@@ h@@ uss@@ ein@@ i - the only major leader to rise to promin@@ ence within the west bank and ga@@ za strip - died young .
ar@@ af@@ at alone has the power to make everyone o@@ bey him , even if he often decides not to exercise this power .
some argue that an obvious alternative to ar@@ af@@ at is democracy .
but the more likely outcome is an unstable and in@@ effective collective leadership , a division of power into f@@ ie@@ f@@ d@@ oms , or a high degree of an@@ arch@@ y .
in a post-@@ ar@@ af@@ at situation , it will be much harder for any successor or success@@ ors to impose discipline and hierarch@@ y on the pal@@ est@@ ine liber@@ ation organization ( pl@@ o ) , the pa , or fat@@ ah .
nor will ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s departure revi@@ ve hopes for a political settlement with isra@@ el .
true , ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s refusal to authori@@ ze crucial compromises on such matters as isra@@ el &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s legitimacy and pal@@ est@@ ine &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s borders has been a critical reason for the failure to resolve the isra@@ el-@@ pal@@ est@@ inian or arab@@ -@@ isra@@ eli conflicts .
given ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s stat@@ ure and control over the movement , he could have down@@ sized the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; goals to acceptance of a state in only part of historic pal@@ est@@ ine .
but he never took the lea@@ p , and the major issues remain un@@ resolved .
the problem is that even if future pal@@ est@@ inian leaders want to resolve the issues that block peace with isra@@ el , doing so will be far more difficult than it would have been for ar@@ af@@ at .
under ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s long rule , whole generations of pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans have been in@@ doc@@ trin@@ ated with the belief that only total victory is acceptable .
indeed , beyond day-to-day policies , ar@@ af@@ at has constructed the pal@@ est@@ inian movement &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s intellectual and psycho@@ -@@ political style , which is dog@@ matic and un@@ com@@ promising .
ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s legacy is thus a political culture in which a leader may portra@@ y a disastrous tac@@ tic , strategy , or outcome as a victory and be believed .
so no political price is ever paid for continuing wars that cannot be won or making demands that will not be met .
the acceptance of violence without limit will be the most devastating feature of ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s legacy .
many movements throughout history have used violence , but few have so thoroughly justified and roman@@ tici@@ zed it .
this problem will not go away when ar@@ af@@ at does .
how can someone with less legitimacy than ar@@ af@@ at escape this justification of violence ?
entire groups - ham@@ as , islam@@ ic ji@@ had , fat@@ ah &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s al-@@ a@@ q@@ sa mar@@ ty@@ rs &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; bri@@ ga@@ des - and their leaders o@@ we their power to their willingness to kill isra@@ eli@@ s , which has become the ultimate measure of political virtu@@ e .
any effort by pal@@ est@@ inian security authorities to put down these groups by force would lead to far more violence .
ar@@ af@@ at &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s refusal to take sides ide@@ ologically helped create an illu@@ sion of pal@@ est@@ inian unity , with everyone dedicated to a single pal@@ est@@ inian struggle .
he achieved this consensus by de@@ valu@@ ing stat@@ eh@@ ood as an end in itself , building political unity on the my@@ th of an ide@@ alized pre-@@ 1948 pal@@ est@@ inian society that could be &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; recre@@ ated &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; on the basis of the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; right of return &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and isra@@ el &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s dis@@ appearance .
these aims are never going to be realized , but they also have never been sub@@ ordin@@ ated to &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ending the occupation , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; so they form the glu@@ e of pal@@ est@@ inian nation@@ alism .
in today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s di@@ visi@@ ve circumstances , the emergence of a new pal@@ est@@ inian leader will most likely take years .
during that inter@@ reg@@ n@@ um , we should expect dead@@ lock , an@@ arch@@ y , or civil war .
after as@@ simil@@ ation
human migration is as old as history .
even migration to distant places and remote cultures is nothing new .
in the nine@@ teenth century , millions of europ@@ e@@ ans sought liberty and prosperity in the ameri@@ cas , notably in the united states .
what is new today is the scale of migration , often across huge cultural divi@@ des - and often without a definite aim .
the afri@@ can boat people in the medi@@ terranean are often not even sure whether they want to be in ital@@ y , ger@@ many , or b@@ rit@@ ain .
even those who are certain , like north afri@@ cans in sp@@ ain and fran@@ ce , or tur@@ ks in ger@@ many , had as their priority escap@@ ing the hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of their home countries , not arriving at a particular destination .
this modern form of migration raises massive problems for countries on the receiving end .
in europ@@ e , it is probably the most serious social issue today , because no one has a clear idea about how to manage the resulting clas@@ h of cultures .
once upon a time , north ameri@@ ca , notably the us , seemed to provide the answer .
more recently , this has changed , giving rise to a process described by ar@@ thur schl@@ es@@ inger , the hist@@ orian and former ai@@ de to president j@@ oh@@ n f. ken@@ ne@@ dy , in his book the dis@@ un@@ iting of ameri@@ ca . no longer are all us citizens ameri@@ cans .
they have become hy@@ phen@@ ated ameri@@ cans : itali@@ an-@@ ameri@@ cans , afri@@ can@@ -@@ ameri@@ cans , h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic-@@ ameri@@ cans , and so on . the ingredients of the mel@@ ting pot are separ@@ ating .
even in isra@@ el , the last true immigration country - at least for je@@ ws - as@@ simil@@ ation is no longer so easy .
recent new@@ com@@ ers from rus@@ sia have their own political party , and old europ@@ e@@ ans have become a distinct minority .
isra@@ el and ameri@@ ca continue to have mechanisms to integrate new migrants .
language is an important underlying factor , and in isra@@ el , there is the army , while in ameri@@ ca , the values embo@@ died in the constitution still represent a shared sec@@ ular faith .
but these mechanisms are weak@@ ening everywhere , and are virtually non-@@ exist@@ ent in europ@@ ean countries .
modern societies are characterized by acute problems of belonging .
they don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t offer the imp@@ licit , un@@ conscious ties of community that citizens felt in the past .
as a result , people have begun to cling to other , more pri@@ mor@@ dial group identi@@ ties .
they resist as@@ simil@@ ation , f@@ ear@@ ing that it will ro@@ b them of their identity without offering a new one .
what then is the alternative to as@@ simil@@ ation ?
the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sal@@ ad bow@@ l &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; of so-called multi@@ cultur@@ alism is no real alternative , because it does not provide the necessary glu@@ e that bin@@ ds communities together .
all the ingredients remain separate from the outset .
the only viable alternative for which there are examples is probably that of lon@@ don or new y@@ or@@ k .
the main characteristic of this alternative is the co@@ existence of a common public sphere shared by all and a considerable degree of cultural separation in the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; private &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; sphere , notably in residential areas .
the public space is multi@@ cultural in terms of people &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s back@@ grounds , but is governed by agreed values , even a common language , whereas the people &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s private lives are - to use an ug@@ ly word - gh@@ et@@ to@@ ized .
in theory , this is a distinc@@ tly second-@@ best solution to the cultural consequences of migration ; in practice it is the best answer we have .
but it cannot be had for nothing .
even the necessary minimum of a common language requires a deliber@@ ate effort , to say nothing of certain rules of behavior .
living in lon@@ don , i mar@@ vel at the way in which we lon@@ don@@ ers have come to terms with indi@@ an family shops and west indi@@ an-@@ run public transport , while not asking many questions about whole districts that are b@@ ang@@ lades@@ hi or chin@@ ese .
no one has yet found a name for this new version of the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; separate but equal &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; doc@@ tr@@ ine that some of us fought so hard against in the 1960 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s : separate private lives in a common public space that is equal for all .
this is clearly easier in lon@@ don and new y@@ or@@ k than it is in smaller towns or even in the capit@@ als of countries where the world language of english is not spoken .
ber@@ lin &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s tur@@ k@@ ish community and the north afri@@ can communities around par@@ is seem increasingly separate , with their own public sphere and often language .
where this happens , an explo@@ sive condition can arise , a kind of separ@@ atis@@ m within , not by histor@@ ically separate groups but by new@@ com@@ ers against n@@ atives .
if we are forced to abandon the hope of as@@ simil@@ ation , our efforts should concentrate on creating a public space to which all contribute and that all enjoy .
ideally , this should be an expanding public space , for in the end , the element of unity in a modern society is the guarantee of its citizens &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; liberty .
after austerity
new y@@ or@@ k – this year ’ s annual meeting of the international monetary fund made clear that europ@@ e and the international community remain ru@@ d@@ der@@ less when it comes to economic policy .
financial leaders , from finance ministers to leaders of private financial institutions , reiterated the current man@@ tra : the crisis countries have to get their houses in order , reduce their deficits , bring down their national debts , undertake structural reforms , and promote growth .
confidence , it was repeatedly said , needs to be restored .
it is a little precious to hear such pon@@ ti@@ fications from those who , at the hel@@ m of central banks , finance min@@ istri@@ es , and private banks , ste@@ ered the global financial system to the br@@ ink of ru@@ in – and created the ongoing m@@ ess .
worse , sel@@ dom is it explained how to square the circle .
how can confidence be restored as the crisis economies pl@@ unge into recession ?
how can growth be revi@@ ved when austerity will almost surely mean a further decrease in aggreg@@ ate demand , sending output and employment even lower ?
this we should know by now : markets on their own are not stable .
not only do they repeatedly generate dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing asset bub@@ bles , but , when demand weak@@ ens , forces that exacerb@@ ate the down@@ turn come into play .
unemployment , and fear that it will spread , drives down wages , incomes , and consumption – and thus total demand .
decreased rates of household formation – young ameri@@ cans , for example , are increasingly moving back in with their parents – de@@ press housing prices , leading to still more forec@@ lo@@ sures .
there are alternative strategies .
some countries , like ger@@ many , have room for fiscal man@@ eu@@ ver .
using it for investment would enhance long-term growth , with positive sp@@ il@@ lovers to the rest of europ@@ e .
a long-@@ recognized principle is that balanced expansion of taxes and spending stimul@@ ates the economy ; if the program is well designed ( taxes at the top , combined with spending on education ) , the increase in g@@ d@@ p and employment can be significant .
europ@@ e as a whole is not in bad fiscal shape ; its deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ g@@ d@@ p ratio comp@@ ares favor@@ ably with that of the united states .
if each us state were totally responsible for its own budget , including paying all unemployment benefits , ameri@@ ca , too , would be in fiscal crisis .
the lesson is obvious : the whole is more than the sum of its parts .
if europ@@ e – particularly the europ@@ ean central bank – were to bor@@ row , and re-@@ lend the proce@@ eds , the costs of servi@@ cing europ@@ e ’ s debt would fall , creating room for the kinds of expenditure that would promote growth and employment .
there are already institutions within europ@@ e , such as the europ@@ ean investment bank , that could help finance needed investments in the c@@ ash@@ -@@ star@@ ved economies .
the ei@@ b should expand its lending .
there need to be increased funds available to support small and medium-@@ size enterprises – the main source of job creation in all economies – which is especially important , given that credit contra@@ ction by banks h@@ its these enterprises especially hard .
europ@@ e ’ s single-@@ minded focus on austerity is a result of a mis@@ diagnosis of its problems .
gre@@ ece over@@ spent , but sp@@ ain and i@@ reland had fiscal sur@@ pl@@ uses and low deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ g@@ d@@ p rati@@ os before the crisis .
giving lec@@ tures about fiscal pru@@ dence is beside the point .
taking the lec@@ tures seriously – even adopting tight budget frameworks – can be counter@@ productive .
regardless of whether europ@@ e ’ s problems are temporary or fundamental – the eurozone , for example , is far from an “ optimal ” currency area , and tax competition in a free-@@ trade and free-@@ migration area can ero@@ de a viable state – austerity will make matters worse .
the consequences of europ@@ e ’ s r@@ ush to austerity will be long-@@ lasting and possibly severe .
if the euro survi@@ ves , it will come at the price of high unemployment and enormous suffering , especially in the crisis countries .
and the crisis itself almost surely will spread .
fire@@ walls won ’ t work , if ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e is simultaneously thrown on the fire , as europ@@ e seems committed to doing : there is no example of a large economy – and europ@@ e is the world ’ s largest – recover@@ ing as a result of austerity .
as a result , society ’ s most valuable asset , its human capital , is being wa@@ sted and even destroyed .
young people who are long deprived of a decent job – and youth unemployment in some countries is appro@@ aching or exceeding 50 % , and has been un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably high since 2008 – become alien@@ ated .
when they eventually find work , it will be at a much lower wage .
normally , youth is a time when skills get built up ; now , it is a time when they atro@@ ph@@ y .
so many economies are vulnerable to natural disasters – earthqu@@ akes , floods , typ@@ ho@@ ons , hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es , ts@@ un@@ am@@ is – that adding a man@@ -@@ made disaster is all the more tragic .
but that is what europ@@ e is doing .
indeed , its leaders ’ will@@ ful ignor@@ ance of the lessons of the past is criminal .
the pain that europ@@ e , especially its poor and young , is suffering is unnecessary .
fortunately , there is an alternative .
but delay in gras@@ ping it will be very costly , and europ@@ e is running out of time .
after cher@@ nobyl
k@@ ie@@ v : cher@@ nobyl , the world ’ s most not@@ orious nuclear power plant , will be shut down today , four@@ teen years after it spe@@ wed cl@@ ou@@ ds of radioactive dust into the atmosphere .
back then , ukra@@ ine became the focus of global attention , but ukra@@ ini@@ ans learned of the disaster much later than the rest of the world .
i recall that f@@ ateful sat@@ ur@@ day afternoon with utter clarity , st@@ rolling through k@@ ie@@ v with my six-@@ year-old daughter , ob@@ li@@ vious to the danger .
cher@@ nobyl changed ukra@@ ine forever , and was a cataly@@ st for the down@@ fall of the so@@ vi@@ et union .
ultimately , cher@@ nobyl changed the world .
now that cher@@ nobyl will be permanently shut down , world attention again turns to ukra@@ ine , this time in hope , not fear .
sh@@ utting down a vital source of electrical energy , which cher@@ nobyl remains , is no an easy task , particularly with winter upon us .
ukra@@ ine ’ s energy infrastructure is weak ; losing 8-@@ 10 % of our electricity production and $ 100 million in revenues will stra@@ in the system even more .
we also bear the responsibilities involved in laying off cher@@ nobyl ’ s workers and depri@@ ving the adjacent city of sla@@ v@@ ut@@ y@@ ch ( population 28@@ ,000 ) , of its main source of income .
moreover , we must continue dealing with the technical and ecological issues surrounding the cher@@ nobyl sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ gu@@ s , as well as maintain nuclear safety in the remaining nuclear plants in operation in ukra@@ ine , including what is left of cher@@ nobyl .
in recent years , ukra@@ ine alone financed all the costs of dealing with the cher@@ nobyl disaster , consistently spending 5-@@ 10 % of our state budget revenues to this end .
dealing with the after@@ math of the disaster will remain a financial burden even with the plant closed .
yet closing the plant proves that we keep our promises .
we committed to shut down cher@@ nobyl this year in an agreement with the g-@@ 7 countries and the europ@@ ean commission .
closure of the last remaining re@@ actor at cher@@ nobyl , i believe , must mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation with the europ@@ ean union and g-@@ 7 countries .
closing cher@@ nobyl may be the most dramatic , but it is only a single episode in our reform efforts .
when we gained independence , the world expected great things from ukra@@ ine .
over the course of a decade , the world appeared to forget about us .
now we finally have a chance to break out of the down@@ ward spir@@ al of economic decline .
at long last , our society and economy are set on the path to growth and development .
after pro-@@ reform forces secured victory in last year ’ s presidential elections , all of the branches of government began cooperating to entr@@ en@@ ch democracy and the market economy in ukra@@ ine .
for the first time since independence , ukra@@ ine recorded growth in industrial output of 12.@@ 5 % in the first 11 months of 2000 , and g@@ d@@ p has grown by 5.@@ 4 % this year .
tough decisions were made , not least involving the energy sector .
bar@@ ter payments , -- which sti@@ fl@@ ed the energy market -- were eliminated . so too tax breaks and other privileges that sk@@ e@@ wed the playing field in favor of a select few .
we are also doing everything possible to make ukra@@ ine attractive to foreign investors .
to ensure complete transparency in the tender process , and eliminate problems experienced in the past , western advis@@ ors are assisting us .
for our intention is to attract large western energy companies with experience in this field as strategic investors .
ten leading international energy companies , indeed , will participate in the privati@@ zation of the first group of companies .
by the end of next year , we will privati@@ ze 12 additional energy companies .
in its she@@ er scale , this may be the largest single energy privati@@ zation ever attempted in europ@@ e .
our energy companies service a territory the size of fran@@ ce ; they will all be privati@@ zed .
of course , these reforms are resist@@ ed , primarily by the oli@@ gar@@ chs who thri@@ ve on a lack of transparency and use privileged access to state resources to enhance their business interests .
by eliminating bar@@ ter and requiring monetary payment , we cur@@ ta@@ iled their opportunities to profit at the state ’ s expense .
although we can and will continue the fight against corruption , we cannot do everything alone .
international support for our efforts is crucial .
a positive sign here is the recent decision by the europ@@ ean bank for reconstruction and development ( eb@@ rd ) to provide $ 2@@ 15 million to complete the nuclear power stations at ri@@ v@@ ne and k@@ h@@ mel@@ ny@@ ts@@ ky , which will compensate for the loss of cher@@ nobyl ’ s generating capacity .
euro@@ atom is also helping with a loan of $ 5@@ 85 million to finance repa@@ irs at ukra@@ ine ’ s functioning nuclear power plants .
in return , ukra@@ ine will uphold its end of the deal : in addition to closing cher@@ nobyl , we will introduce western nuclear safety standards and ren@@ ew cooperation with the im@@ f via the extended fund facility program .
we still need other potential credi@@ tors to confirm their involvement .
closing cher@@ nobyl will not eliminate the cher@@ nobyl threat .
our people will be unable to live on thousands of acres of contamin@@ ated earth for hundreds of years .
the concrete sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ gu@@ s built over the destroyed re@@ actor must be renovated .
we are grateful to all the donor countries who , with contributions from our own state budget , helped raise the $ 7@@ 60 million needed to make the sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ gu@@ s safer .
in the end , cher@@ nobyl ’ s legacy does not belong solely to ukra@@ ine , for ours is a country located in the heart of europ@@ e .
we are a europ@@ ean nation .
we realize that no one will implement reforms for us .
the west can , however , help speed up and facilitate our efforts , as it did with the closure of cher@@ nobyl .
cooperation between ukra@@ ine and the west , without a disaster to concentrate everyone ’ s minds , will benefit all concerned .
after dictatorship
the war in i@@ ra@@ q had barely begun when the minds of those who conceived the invasion turned to what should happen after the victory over sad@@ dam hus@@ sein &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s regi@@ me@@ -@@ a victory everyone assumed to be inevitable .
politicians and experts have inv@@ ari@@ ably sought to draw compar@@ isons with recent examples like afgh@@ an@@ istan , si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , east tim@@ or , but also with more remote and fundamental cases .
after all , what is expected in i@@ ra@@ q is the fall of a highly ideological dictatorship .
is there anything we can learn from the last examples of this kind , from the collapse of commun@@ ism in eastern europ@@ e in 1989 , or the end of the third reich in ger@@ many in 1945 and the process of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; de-@@ na@@ zi@@ fication &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that followed ?
the risks of such compar@@ isons are almost too obvious for words .
every case has its own defining features .
regarding the dem@@ ise of commun@@ ism , the experiences of , say , pol@@ and and roman@@ ia are pro@@ found@@ ly different .
as we cross even more profound cultural boundaries , compar@@ isons become still less relevant .
yet there are a few issues that are common to the un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing of most ideological dictator@@ ships .
one such issue has to do with memory , and dealing with the past .
this is connected with a practical question : who is in a position to build a new country on the ruins of the old regime ?
it is rare for a counter-@@ elite to emerge quickly , much less for an el@@ it@@ e-@@ in-@@ waiting to take over .
in ger@@ many in the 195@@ 0s , there were many complaints about old n@@ az@@ is re@@ appearing in a democratic gu@@ ise and occup@@ ying important positions .
many of us fought against the apparent &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; restoration &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; of the old regime .
in eastern europ@@ e , the old leaders initially disappeared from the scene , but not for long .
ex-@@ commun@@ ists were often re@@ inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ated politically as social democ@@ rats .
those who had been in the resist@@ ance-@@ like vá@@ cla@@ v ha@@ vel in pra@@ gu@@ e-@@ found this hard to take .
yet these communist appar@@ at@@ chi@@ ks were not the same people they had been .
circumstances had changed and the people with them .
this has a great deal to do with methods of dealing with the past .
post-@@ 1945 ger@@ many and post-@@ 1989 pol@@ and are examples of countries that moved forward without much attention to the past .
intellec@@ tu@@ als compla@@ ined that too little time and energy was spent on &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; master@@ ing &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; the past .
they had good reasons to compla@@ in .
indeed , after a decade or so , the need to draw clear lines and tell all , including the painful stories , became overwhelming .
but the most successful post@@ communist countries moved forward first and cop@@ ed with the past later .
those who could not lift their eyes from the hor@@ rors of the past made less progress .
a second general issue has to do with priorities .
there is a natural tenden@@ c@@ y-@@ especially in ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on coun@@ tri@@ es-@@ to regard elections as the most effective institutional remedy for countries emerging from ideological dictator@@ ships .
to be sure , elections are important ; but by themselves they do not solve problems .
indeed , if they dis@@ appoint , the very principles on which they are bas@@ ed-@@ democracy and civil liber@@ ti@@ es-@@ will be dis@@ credi@@ ted .
i am a strong , almost ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned belie@@ ver in parliamentary democracy , but when it comes to situations like post@@ war i@@ ra@@ q , two other imper@@ atives are equally pressing .
one is the need to establish an effective administration to make certain that new policies of tolerance and market economics are actually implemented .
in east europ@@ ean countries , this was a major problem , and it is only through accession negotiations with the europ@@ ean union that such administrative reform has been assured .
the second imperative is the rule of law .
the law has a different place in different cultures , and it presents special problems in islam@@ ic countries .
however , it is crucial that every effort be made to educ@@ ate and install an im@@ partial and incor@@ rup@@ tible judiciary .
judges must not only be honest , but must be seen to be so and , as such , tru@@ sted .
the process of establishing the rule of law has been difficult and has remained incomplete in most post-@@ dict@@ at@@ orial countries ; yet it will be a key to successful recovery in i@@ ra@@ q as well .
one of the key points that i empha@@ sized in my 1990 book reflec@@ tions on the revolution in europ@@ e is also valid for i@@ ra@@ q .
the road from the collapse of a dict@@ at@@ orial regime backed by ideology to a more liberal order leads through a valley of te@@ ars .
things are likely to get worse before they get better .
this is notably the case in economic terms .
even post-@@ war ger@@ many &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s acc@@ laimed , mi@@ ra@@ cle@@ -@@ working economics minister , lu@@ d@@ wig erh@@ ard , was deeply un@@ popular in the early 195@@ 0s , because it appeared as if only a few were getting rich , while most west ger@@ mans remained poor or got poorer .
for a certain period in the process of recovery , it is simply necessary for people to keep their ner@@ ve .
pol@@ and is a recent example of a country that achieved this fe@@ at .
it requires plau@@ sible leadership and the reasonable hope that things will get better before long .
if this time of transition goes wrong , the alternative is renewed tur@@ mo@@ il and the victory of fundament@@ alists of one kind or another .
the warning &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; be@@ ware of the valley of te@@ ars ! &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is thus the one that must be taken most seriously by those responsible for re@@ building an i@@ ra@@ q scar@@ red by the ter@@ rors of dictatorship and the ra@@ v@@ ages of war .
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – the first years of this century have been head@@ y ones for global health .
international donors – whether national governments , such as the united states , through its p@@ ep@@ far program , or new international funding initiatives , such as the global fund to fight aids , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , and malaria and g@@ av@@ i , the vacc@@ ine alliance – have invested billions of dollars in national dis@@ eas@@ e-@@ control programs and health systems , saving millions of lives .
but now some of the countries that have benefited from these programs face a new challenge : su@@ sta@@ ining the gains they have made once external support is withdrawn .
ultimately , it is on the basis of this transition that donors ’ initiatives – and the health aid enterprise as a whole – will be judged .
consider g@@ av@@ i , the vacc@@ ine alliance .
founded in 2000 by a partnership of major donors , international agencies , and vacc@@ ine industry leaders , g@@ av@@ i ’ s goal is to help the world ’ s poorest countries introduce new li@@ fes@@ aving vacc@@ ines and strengthen their imm@@ uni@@ zation programs .
when a country ’ s annual per capita income rises above a certain threshold – currently $ 1,@@ 5@@ 80 – it becomes ine@@ li@@ gible for g@@ av@@ i support .
of course , g@@ av@@ i doesn ’ t just cut off funding all at once .
support is ph@@ ased out over a period of several years .
during this transition period , countries rapidly increase their financial contribution to their imm@@ uni@@ zation programs and prepare to assume full responsibility .
this approach , which enables g@@ av@@ i to concentrate its resources on countries with the greatest need , has been in place since 2010 .
but it is now being put to a stern test : one-@@ third of the 73 countries to which g@@ av@@ i extends support are either in the midst of the transition process or have just completed it .
the group includes countries as different from one another as ar@@ men@@ ia , b@@ hut@@ an , hon@@ dur@@ as , and vi@@ et@@ nam , as well as indi@@ a and ni@@ geri@@ a , which have the largest birth co@@ h@@ orts .
the g@@ av@@ i model is now under the micro@@ scope .
will countries be able to continue purchasing and delivering the vacc@@ ines that were introduced with g@@ av@@ i support ?
equally important , will that commitment hold up over time ?
if government budgets are cut , will imm@@ uni@@ zation be protected , along with other essential health services ?
will countries be able to introduce new li@@ fes@@ aving vacc@@ ines as they become available ?
will they sustain and strengthen disease surveillance , so that out@@ breaks are detected and addressed quickly ?
or will fiscal pressures lead , in some countries , to vacc@@ ine short@@ ages , to dec@@ lines in imm@@ uni@@ zation coverage , or even , in the worst case , to vacc@@ ines being dropped altogether from national programs , revers@@ ing the har@@ d-@@ won gains of recent years ?
the answers to these questions are important not only for the countries themselves , but also for their neigh@@ b@@ ors , which could be put at risk by back@@ sli@@ ding on imm@@ uni@@ zation .
the recent yellow fe@@ ver epide@@ mic in ang@@ ola , for example , spread to its much poorer neigh@@ bor , the democratic re@@ public of con@@ go .
the experiences of countries that have “ gradu@@ ated ” from g@@ av@@ i assistance will also hold important lessons for other international health programs and their beneficiaries .
with so much at stake , international agencies must do whatever they can to prepare countries for “ life after g@@ av@@ i . ”
for some of these countries , especially those that have adopted many new vacc@@ ines , obtaining adequate and sustainable financing is one of the most da@@ un@@ ting challenges posed by the transition .
although imm@@ uni@@ zation programs require only a relatively small share of health budgets and yield exceptionally high economic returns , securing the needed financing requires careful planning .
a new resource can help countries as they w@@ rest@@ le with this challenge .
imm@@ uni@@ zation financing : a resource guide for advocates , policymakers , and program managers provides information on estim@@ ating imm@@ uni@@ zation costs , assessing the pro@@ s and cons of various sources of financing , shaping purchasing strategies , and navig@@ ating policy processes .
it does not prescri@@ be one way forward , but rather provides relevant information and expert analysis .
countries can then evaluate options in light of their own circumstances , and advocates can ask the right questions .
with g@@ av@@ i support , close to 5@@ 80 million children have been imm@@ uni@@ zed since 2000 , and more than eight million future deaths have been aver@@ ted .
these are impressive gains that are worth celeb@@ rating .
but only if countries successfully negotiate the transition from g@@ av@@ i support can they be confident that future generations will enjoy the same health protec@@ tions .
now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations , including large emit@@ ters , in convers@@ ations about what to do after the treaty ’ s exp@@ ir@@ ation in 2012 .
this is exactly what the europ@@ ean commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-@@ k@@ yo@@ to era , which will be discussed by the europ@@ ean council next mar@@ ch .
while the k@@ yo@@ to protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industri@@ alized countries – 5.@@ 2 % between 2008-@@ 2012 relative to 1990 levels , with varying targets for individual countries – real progress can be made in su@@ sta@@ ining development efforts and preserving our planet .
but first , all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning , and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy , infrastructure , and transport .
in other words , we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security .
at the end of the day , the long-term approach is likely to include a rul@@ es-@@ based system , an incentives system , and investments in technology change .
increasingly , adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding .
dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive , but complementary .
looking ahead to the post-@@ k@@ yo@@ to world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change .
nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth ’ s temperature , and then as@@ sign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level .
this would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies – a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-@@ private partnerships .
up to now , with only 15 % of the world ’ s population , rich countries have been responsible for more than 75 % of global carbon dioxide ( co@@ 2 ) emissions , and thus most of the environmental damage .
however , it is the developing countries – and thus the world ’ s poor – who are most vulnerable .
it is un@@ realistic to ask poor countries , where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies , to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change .
working with partners , the world bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change .
to date , over $ 1 billion dollars in global environment facility ( ge@@ f ) grants , together with about $ 8 billion in co-@@ financing , have been committed to programs related to climate change .
while the regulatory mechanisms of both k@@ yo@@ to and the europ@@ ean trading scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading , interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future .
without a regulatory framework beyond 2012 , the window of opportunity for initi@@ ating projec@@ t-@@ based transactions will close by 2006 / 2007 .
given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions , project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context .
developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-@@ 7 years from identification , through licensing , financing , and construction , and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions .
therefore , projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007 .
the world bank has been instru@@ mental in adv@@ ancing carbon finance as a viable development tool , and in facilitating priv@@ ate-@@ sector participation in the market .
the bank is focused on representing the interests of its borro@@ wing countries , helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities .
but , without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 , the carbon market will remain uncertain , and the private sector – vital to the market ’ s success – is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way .
according to a recent world ban@@ k-@@ supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance , only one in five respon@@ dents declared that they were interested in buying post-@@ 2012 emissions reductions .
now is the chance to look forward and en@@ list the global community – with no exclu@@ sions , although with differenti@@ ated responsibilities – in the pursuit of a more secure world , one that avoi@@ ds the di@@ re risks of environmental degra@@ dation and social conflict imp@@ lied by in@@ action .
after neo@@ liber@@ alism , what ?
two decades of applying neo@@ liberal economic policies to the developing world have yiel@@ ded dis@@ appointing results .
l@@ atin ameri@@ ca , the region that tried har@@ dest to implement the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; wash@@ ington consensus &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; recip@@ es@@ --@@ free trade , price dereg@@ ulation , and privati@@ z@@ ation@@ --@@ has experienced low and vol@@ atile growth , with wi@@ dening inequalities .
among the former socialist economies of eastern europ@@ e and the so@@ vi@@ et union , few have caught up with real output levels that prev@@ ailed before 1990 .
in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the im@@ f and world bank .
the few instances of success occurred in countries that mar@@ ched to their own dru@@ mm@@ ers@@ --@@ and that are hardly po@@ ster children for neo@@ liber@@ alism .
ch@@ ina , vi@@ et@@ nam , indi@@ a : all three viol@@ ated virtually every rule in the neo@@ liberal gu@@ ide@@ book , even as they moved in a more market-@@ oriented direction .
it is time to abandon neo@@ liber@@ alism and the wash@@ ington consensus .
but the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development , without falling into the tra@@ p of pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ating yet another im@@ practical blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int , sup@@ pose@@ dly right for all countries at all times .
the record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be an@@ cho@@ red in two strategies : an investment strategy designed to ki@@ ck-@@ start growth in the short term , and an institution@@ -@@ building strategy designed to provide an economy with re@@ sili@@ ence in the face of adverse sho@@ cks .
the key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs exc@@ ited about the home economy .
encouraging foreign investment or liber@@ alizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work .
an effective strategy must accompl@@ ish two tasks : encourage investment in non-@@ traditional areas , and we@@ ed out projects and investments that fail .
for this , governments must deplo@@ y both the car@@ rot and the stick .
learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development .
the car@@ rot is needed because there is great social value in dis@@ covering , for example , that cut flowers , or so@@ cc@@ er b@@ alls , or computer software can be produced at low cost , because this knowledge can ori@@ ent the investments of other entrepreneurs .
the entreprene@@ ur who makes the initial &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; discovery &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates , as other entrepreneurs will quickly em@@ ul@@ ate him .
consequently , entrepreneurship of this ty@@ pe@@ --@@ learning what can be produc@@ ed@@ --@@ will typically be under-@@ supplied in the absence of non-@@ market incentives .
in turn , the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in un@@ productive and wa@@ ste@@ ful investments .
implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country , depending on administrative capacity , the prev@@ ailing incentive regime , the flexibility of the fiscal system , the degree of sophistic@@ ation of the financial sector , and the underlying political economy .
time-@@ bound subsidy schemes , public venture funds , and export subsidi@@ zation are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented , but there are many others .
no single instrument will work everywhere .
governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to m@@ ess things up rather than improve allocation of resources .
the job can be done , but economic growth requires more than e@@ lic@@ iting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship .
it also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build re@@ sili@@ ence to sho@@ cks :
market-@@ creating institutions ( for property rights and contract enforcement ) ;
market-@@ regulating institutions ( for extern@@ alities , economies of scale , and information about companies ) ;
market-@@ stabili@@ zing institutions ( for monetary and fiscal management ) ;
market-@@ legitim@@ izing institutions ( for social protection and insurance ) .
building and solidi@@ fying these institutions , however , takes time .
using an initial period of growth to experiment and innov@@ ate on these fron@@ ts can pay high divi@@ den@@ ds later on .
a key point here is that institutional arrangements are , by necessity , countr@@ y-@@ specific .
after all , institutions are not ho@@ t-@@ house plants capable of being plan@@ ted in any soil and climate .
reforms that succeed in one setting may perform po@@ or@@ ly or fail completely in others .
such specific@@ ity helps explain why successful coun@@ tri@@ es@@ --@@ ch@@ ina , indi@@ a , south korea , and ta@@ i@@ wan , among o@@ ther@@ s@@ --@@ usually combined un@@ orthodo@@ x elements with orthodo@@ x policies .
it also accounts for why important institutional differences pers@@ ist among the advanced countries of north ameri@@ ca , western europ@@ e , and jap@@ an in areas such as the role of the public sector , the legal system , corporate governance , financial markets , labor markets , and social insurance .
while economic analysis can help in making institutional choices , there is also a large role for public deliber@@ ation and collective choice .
in fact , we can think of particip@@ atory democracy as a met@@ a-@@ institution that helps select among the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; menu &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; of possible institutional arrangements in each area .
designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neo@@ liberal policies .
it is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually countr@@ y-@@ specific and do not respond well to standardi@@ zed recip@@ es .
but it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted , relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic pay@@ off@@ s and start a virtu@@ ous cycle of growth and institutional reform .
adopting this approach does not mean aband@@ oning main@@ stream econom@@ ic@@ s@@ --@@ far from it .
neo@@ liber@@ alism is to ne@@ oc@@ las@@ sical economics as astro@@ log@@ y is to astronom@@ y .
in both cases , it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other .
critics of neo@@ liber@@ alism should not oppose main@@ stream econom@@ ic@@ s@@ --@@ only its mis@@ use .
new y@@ or@@ k – the attacks in par@@ is by individuals associated with the islam@@ ic state , coming on the he@@ els of bom@@ b@@ ings in bei@@ ru@@ t and the down@@ ing of a rus@@ sian air@@ liner over the sin@@ ai pen@@ insula , reinforce the reality that the terrorist threat has entered a new and even more dangerous phase .
just why the islam@@ ic state decided to stage its attacks now is a matter for con@@ jec@@ ture ; it may well be that it is going global to compensate for its recent loss of territory in i@@ ra@@ q .
but whatever the r@@ ationale , what is certain is that a clear response is warran@@ ted .
actually , the challenge posed by the islam@@ ic state calls for several responses , as there is no single policy that promises to be sufficient .
multiple efforts are needed in multiple domains .
one is military . more intense attacks from the air against islam@@ ic state military assets , oil and gas facilities , and leaders are critical .
but no amount of air power on its own will ever get the job done .
a substantial ground component is needed if territory is to be taken and held .
unfortunately , there is no time to build a partner force on the ground from scrat@@ ch .
this has been tried and failed , and ar@@ ab states are unable or un@@ willing to constitute one .
the i@@ ra@@ q@@ i army has also come up short .
ir@@ an-@@ backed mi@@ liti@@ as only make matters worse .
the best option is to work more closely with kur@@ dish troops and select sun@@ ni tri@@ bes in both i@@ ra@@ q and sy@@ ria .
this means providing intelligence , arms , and being willing to send more soldiers – more than the 3,@@ 500 ameri@@ cans already there , and possibly on the order of 10,000 – to train , advise , and help direct a military response .
such an effort must be collective .
it can be informal – a “ coalition of the willing ” that would include the united states , fran@@ ce , the united king@@ dom , ar@@ ab states , and even rus@@ sia under the right circumstances – or carried out under nat@@ o or united nations au@@ spices .
the packaging matters less than the results .
symbolic declarations of war , though , ought to be considered with cau@@ tion , l@@ est the islam@@ ic state appear to be winning every day it does not lose .
a diplomatic component is no less essential to any response .
sy@@ ri@@ an president bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad is a recru@@ iting tool for the islam@@ ic state and must go .
but any successor government must be able to maintain order and not permit the islam@@ ic state to exploit a power vacuum , as it has done in li@@ b@@ ya .
moreover , order@@ ly political change can be brought about only with rus@@ sian and ir@@ anian support .
one near@@ -@@ term option worth exploring is a coalition government still headed by a representative of the al@@ aw@@ ite minority , a conc@@ ession that could well be the price of moving as@@ sad out of power .
in principle , and over time , a more representative national government could come about , although talk of holding elections in 18 months is fan@@ ci@@ ful under any scenario .
but reaching a compromise along these lines could well be impossible .
this is why increased military effort is needed to bring about larger and more secure en@@ cla@@ ves that could better protect civilians and take the fight to the islam@@ ic state .
sy@@ ria is not a normal country in any sense , and it will not be for a long time , if ever .
a sy@@ ria of en@@ cla@@ ves or c@@ ant@@ ons is a more realistic model for the fore@@ see@@ able future .
other indispensable elements of any effective strategy include expanded help for or pressure on tur@@ key to do much more to stem the flow of recru@@ its to the islam@@ ic state .
and tur@@ key , along with jord@@ an and le@@ ban@@ on , need more financial assistance as they shoulder the bulk of the refugee burden .
ar@@ ab and mus@@ li@@ m leaders can do their part by speaking out to challenge the islam@@ ic state ’ s vision and dele@@ gi@@ tim@@ ize its behavior .
there is also a domestic dimension to policy .
hom@@ eland security and law enforcement – increasing protection both at borders and within them – will have to adjust to the increased threat .
retail terrorists – individuals or small groups carrying out armed attacks against soft targets in open societies – are extremely difficult to deal with .
the threat and the reality of attacks will require greater social re@@ sili@@ ence and quite possibly a re@@ balancing of individual privacy and collective security .
what is also required is a dose of realis@@ m .
the struggle against the islam@@ ic state is not a conventional war .
we cannot eradic@@ ate or destroy it any time soon , as it is as much a network and an idea as it is an organization and a de facto state that controls territory and resources .
indeed , terrorism is and will continue to be one of the s@@ cour@@ ges of this era .
the good news , though , is that the threat posed by the islam@@ ic state to the middle east and the rest of the world can be dramatically reduced through sustained , concer@@ ted action .
the main lesson of the attack on par@@ is is that we must be prepared to act over time and place alike .
after pa@@ x ameri@@ can@@ a ?
new y@@ or@@ k – it has become popular to suggest that when the dust sett@@ les from the global financial crisis , it may become clear that the united stat@@ es-@@ led post-@@ war world has come to an end .
if so , the global system that has secured peace , security , openness , and economic growth over the past six decades could be in grave danger .
inspired by ameri@@ can leadership since world war ii ’ s end , europ@@ e , then jap@@ an , then much of a@@ sia and the world rose to new levels of prosperity ; the world economy glob@@ alized upon the foundation of international institutions , norms , and standards ; and foreign students educated in ameri@@ can universities returned home with new ideas about free markets , entrepreneurship , and democracy .
the us military ’ s protective umbrel@@ la gave large s@@ wa@@ ths of the world a vacation from war , making it easier for them to focus on economic growth and regional integration .
ameri@@ ca not only took the lead role in building the institutions of a glob@@ alizing world – the united nations , world bank , im@@ f , nat@@ o – it also became the model that many other countries looked to for inspiration .
after eight years of com@@ promised ameri@@ can leadership , a bot@@ ched war of choice in i@@ ra@@ q , failure to take the lead in global efforts to address climate change , ab@@ u gh@@ ra@@ i@@ b , gu@@ ant@@ ánam@@ o bay , running up a $ 10 tril@@ lion debt , and ign@@ iting a global financial crisis – ameri@@ ca ’ s on@@ ce-@@ gl@@ it@@ tering model has lost a good deal of its lu@@ ster and ameri@@ ca ’ s leadership has been ques@@ tioned by many .
the point was driven home at the 7th asi@@ a-@@ europ@@ e meeting ( as@@ em ) in bei@@ jing this autumn , where europ@@ ean and asi@@ an leaders began exploring ideas for a new global financial structure .
for much of the past 60 years , it would have been impossible to hold such a fundamental dialogue without us participation .
today , it is almost becoming a new global nor@@ m that neither the international committee nor the us is prepared for .
despite talk about ameri@@ can decline , the world is not prepared for a post-@@ ameri@@ can era .
as ir@@ k@@ some as some of ameri@@ ca ’ s actions have been , particularly over the past eight years , ameri@@ ca remains the world ’ s most critical champi@@ on of the progressive values that have li@@ fted hundreds of millions of people out of ab@@ ject poverty and political repression .
if the us were to play a relatively smaller role in world affairs , and no other system was created to pick up the s@@ lack , these values could be at risk .
although many states now hide behind an alleged universal principle of in@@ viol@@ able state sovereignty , for example , would the international community really want to go back to the old model where states did whatever they wanted to their citizens within the con@@ fines of their own borders ?
do countries around the world believe that they will be better off if the global trade system breaks down or international shipping lan@@ es become less secure ?
are countries like ch@@ ina willing to step up and pay their fair share of du@@ es to keep the un running ( ch@@ ina currently pays 2.1 % of un du@@ es , compared to more than 25 % for the us ) , or to cap@@ itali@@ ze revised international financial institutions or the global fund to fight aids , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , and malaria in a meaningful way ?
unless other countries become more willing to step forward for the common good , a post-@@ ameri@@ can world could quickly become a far more fri@@ gh@@ tening environment than what it would replace .
even at the ap@@ ex of ameri@@ can power , ameri@@ ca ’ s great@@ ness was always based on inspir@@ ing others , and the opportunities for building market share in that particular category remain unlimited .
it is impossible to over@@ estimate how significant a step bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s election is in this direction , but ameri@@ ca ’ s actions over the coming years will be the ultimate determin@@ ant of whether the power of ameri@@ ca ’ s model can be restored .
closing the prison at gu@@ ant@@ ánam@@ o and reaffir@@ ming ameri@@ ca ’ s commitment to international law and human rights will also be an important step in this direction .
the world wants to believe in an ameri@@ ca that lives up to its own best values .
the prospect of a truly global community of nations working together to achieve the greater good for all is indeed exciting .
but , although ameri@@ ca has been far from perfect over the last six decades , the end of the pa@@ x ameri@@ can@@ a has the potential to create a dangerous void in international affairs .
if the world is going to shift in the direction of a new and more globally democratic system , other nations will need to meaningfully step forward to assume new responsibilities .
it is in ameri@@ ca ’ s and the world ’ s interest that they do so . the evidence of this will be seen not only in global institutions but also in places like dar@@ fur , zim@@ babwe , and bur@@ ma .
until this happens , let us all hope that ameri@@ ca can get back on track as the global champi@@ on of collabor@@ ative action to address the world ’ s greatest challenges and work with as many other countries as possible to move collecti@@ vely in the right direction .
after@@ sho@@ cks from jap@@ an
new haven – the dev@@ ast@@ ation – both human and physical – from the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami in jap@@ an is un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able .
it is impossible at this point to gau@@ ge the full extent of the damage with any degree of precision .
but we can nonetheless begin to assess its potential sp@@ il@@ lo@@ ver effects on the rest of a@@ sia and other major economies around the world .
the narrow view of the catastro@@ phe ’ s economic impact is that jap@@ an doesn ’ t really matter anymore .
after all , more than 20 years of un@@ usually s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish trend growth in jap@@ anese output has sharp@@ ly reduced its incre@@ mental impact on the broader global economy .
the disaster may produce some disproportionate sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ chain effects in au@@ tos and inform@@ ation-@@ technology product lines such as flash drives , but any such dis@@ rup@@ tions would tend to be tran@@ sit@@ ory .
on the surface , the world ’ s two largest economies have little to fear .
jap@@ an accounts for only 5 % of ameri@@ ca ’ s exports and 8 % of ch@@ ina ’ s .
under the wor@@ st-@@ case outcome of a complete dis@@ ruption to the jap@@ anese economy , the direct repercussions on the united states and chin@@ ese economies would be small – sha@@ ving no more than a few ten@@ ths of a percentage point off their annual growth rates .
within the so-called g-@@ 10 developed economies , au@@ str@@ alia has the largest direct exposure to jap@@ an – the destination of about 19 % of its total exports .
the eurozone is at the opposite end of the spectrum , with jap@@ an accounting for less than 2 % of its exports .
among emerg@@ ing-@@ markets , the p@@ hili@@ pp@@ ines and in@@ don@@ esia are the most exposed to jap@@ an , which absor@@ bs about 16 % of their total exports .
south korea , the third-@@ largest economy in east a@@ sia , is at the other end of the scale , rel@@ ying on jap@@ anese demand for only about 6 % of its exports .
but the narrow view mis@@ ses the most critical consideration : this “ jap@@ an shock ” has not occurred at a time of great economic strength .
that is true not only of jap@@ an itself , where two lost decades have left a on@@ ce-@@ vig@@ orous economy on a less@@ -@@ than@@ -@@ 1 % growth tra@@ jec@@ tory since the early 1990 ’ s .
but it is also true of the broader global economy , which was only just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis and recession since the 1930 ’ s .
moreover , the jap@@ an shock is not the only negative factor at work today .
the impacts of sharp@@ ly rising oil prices and ongoing sovereign debt problems in europ@@ e are also very wor@@ ris@@ ome .
while each of these sho@@ cks may not qualify as the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ti@@ pping point , the combination and the context are dis@@ concer@@ ting , to say the least .
not@@ with@@ standing the eu@@ ph@@ or@@ ic res@@ ur@@ gence of global equity markets over the past two years , the world economy remains fragile .
what markets seem to have forgotten is that post-@@ bub@@ ble , post-@@ finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ crisis recover@@ ies tend to be an@@ em@@ ic .
economies grow at something much closer to their st@@ all speeds , thus lacking the cyc@@ lical “ escape vel@@ o@@ city ” required for a self-@@ su@@ sta@@ ining recovery .
as a result , post-@@ crisis economies are far more vulnerable to sho@@ cks and pr@@ one to rela@@ p@@ ses than might otherwise be the case .
al@@ as , there is an added complic@@ ation that makes today ’ s sho@@ cks all the more v@@ ex@@ ing : governments and central banks have exhau@@ sted the traditional amm@@ uni@@ tion upon which they have long re@@ lied during times of economic du@@ ress .
that is true of both monetary and fiscal policy – the two main@@ stays of modern counter@@ cyc@@ lical stabili@@ zation .
policy interest rates are close to zero in the major economies in the developed world , and out@@ size budget deficits are the nor@@ m .
as a result , un@@ conventional – and un@@ tested – policies , such as so-called “ quantitative eas@@ ing , ” have become the rage among central ban@@ kers .
all along , such un@@ conventional policies were viewed as a temporary fix .
the hope was that policy settings soon would return to pre-@@ crisis norms .
but , with one shock following another , the “ exit strategy ” keeps being de@@ fer@@ red .
just as it is next to impossible to take a critic@@ ally ill patient off life-@@ support treatment , it is equally difficult to we@@ an post-@@ bub@@ ble economies from their now steady dose of liquidity in@@ jec@@ tions and deficit spending .
in an era of extra@@ ordin@@ arily high unemployment , political pressures only compo@@ und the problem .
this raises perhaps the most troub@@ les@@ ome concern of all : with a post-@@ crisis world getting hit by one shock after another , and with central banks having no l@@ ati@@ tude to cut interest rates , it is not hard to en@@ vision a scenario of open-@@ ended monetary expansion that ends in te@@ ars .
the d@@ read@@ ed infl@@ ation@@ ary end@@ game suddenly lo@@ oms as a very real possibility .
none of this de@@ trac@@ ts from the re@@ sili@@ ence factor .
yes , jap@@ an will re@@ build , which will undoubtedly sp@@ ur some type of recovery in its disast@@ er-@@ batter@@ ed economy .
that happened in the after@@ math of the han@@ sh@@ in ( ko@@ be ) earthquake in 1995 , and it will happen this time as well .
but , just as the post-@@ ko@@ be re@@ building did little to end the first of jap@@ an ’ s lost decades , a similar outcome can be expected this time .
the up@@ side of re@@ building – beyond the urgent restoration of normal life for thousands of people – is only a temporary pal@@ li@@ ative for an im@@ pa@@ ired economy .
that ’ s only one of the lessons that jap@@ an offers the rest of us .
the jap@@ anese economy has , in fact , been on the leading edge of many of the more serious problems that have aff@@ lic@@ ted the global economy in recent years .
from asset bub@@ bles and a d@@ ys@@ functional financial system to currency sup@@ pression and mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy bl@@ under@@ s , jap@@ an has been in many respects the laboratory of our future .
unfortunately , the world has failed to learn the lessons of jap@@ an .
and now it risks missing another important clu@@ e .
the significance of the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami of 2011 is not the relatively low mag@@ nit@@ ude of jap@@ an ’ s direct impact on the broader global economy .
the more meaningful message is how these sho@@ cks box the rest of us into an even ti@@ ghter corner .
se@@ oul – korea is a unique country .
the cold war ended when the so@@ vi@@ et union collap@@ sed in 1991 , and is now remember@@ ed only as history to most people around the world .
the kore@@ an pen@@ insula , however , remains divided along ideological lines , and the two kore@@ as co-@@ exist as living rem@@ n@@ ants of the cold war .
a total of almost 1.5 million young soldiers from both north and south korea face off against each across the heavily armed de@@ milit@@ ari@@ zed zone .
events and structural forces , however , have affected and changed the nature of the north kore@@ an system since 1991 .
the sudden dis@@ continuation of the supply of pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um and natural resources from rus@@ sia in the early 1990 ’ s , the failure of the centr@@ ally-@@ planned economy , and the subsequent massive fam@@ ine in the mid-@@ 1990 ’ s left north korea ’ s leaders no alternative but to toler@@ ate informal market activities .
nowadays , every north kore@@ an seems to like money and know its value .
the engagement policy pursued by the south kore@@ an government in recent years also contributed to changes in north kore@@ ans ’ perc@@ ep@@ tions of the outside world and of their own ab@@ ject economic situation .
in these desper@@ ate circumstances , north korea ’ s leaders c@@ lung to their strategy of developing nuclear weapons as a last resort to defend the security of their regime .
but , regardless of whether the nuclear issue is resolved , the spread of market forces in north korea will continue to change every aspect of life there in the coming years .
nobody yet knows what the political consequences of these economic changes will be .
the “ de@@ ar leader ’ s ” declining health will add even more uncertainty and may cause international instability across east a@@ sia .
for example , k@@ im il sung gro@@ om@@ ed his son k@@ im j@@ ong@@ -@@ il as his successor for about two decades before the younger k@@ im took power in 1994 .
k@@ im j@@ ong@@ -@@ il , however , has not yet even chosen his successor .
indeed , it is widely expected that a new system of collective leadership will emerge if k@@ im j@@ ong@@ -@@ il is inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ it@@ ated .
the problem is that north korea has no experience with collective leadership .
in the last six decades , all power has been concentrated in the hands of one person .
one-@@ man rule has been so completely embedded in north korea ’ s political culture and system that it is difficult to expect collective leadership to succeed .
thus , some type of power struggle , rather like what occurred in the so@@ vi@@ et union following stal@@ in ’ s death , may inv@@ ari@@ ably follow a brief period of collective rule .
the di@@ lemma for the world is that major decisions will have to be made during this period of instability .
will the north ’ s w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be leaders be able to manage the country ’ s stock of nuclear weapons respon@@ sibly and safely without transfer@@ ring a few of them abroad , much less respond to international pressure to disman@@ tle them in a reasonable and flexible manner ?
over the past decade , k@@ im j@@ ong@@ -@@ il has empha@@ sized the importance of his militar@@ y-@@ first policy .
as a result , the army will be dominant in decision making on important issues like nuclear negotiations .
but the problem with military rule is a tendency toward incomplete understanding of the implications of political decisions – a problem that will be ag@@ grav@@ ated further by collective leadership .
under a north kore@@ an collective leadership dominated by the military , the power of the country ’ s economic bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats will be margin@@ al , at best .
this may lead to sup@@ pression of pressure from below for economic reform and opening .
as a result , the economy may wor@@ sen and political instability increase .
in such a difficult domestic situation , north korea ’ s leaders may adopt more hosti@@ le policies to obtain economic aid from both south korea and the united states .
recently , south korea ’ s government made it clear that it would continue to engage north korea , but in a more prin@@ cipl@@ ed way than had previous administrations .
this reflects a har@@ dening of south kore@@ an public opinion , following north korea ’ s nuclear test in 2006 .
as a result of this policy shift – and the recent killing of a south kore@@ an tourist in north korea ’ s k@@ um@@ gang mountains – official dialogue between north and south has stopped for the past several months .
international relations in nor@@ theast a@@ sia will become more sub@@ tle and unstable as the k@@ im j@@ ong@@ -@@ il era ends .
after six tur@@ bul@@ ent but somewhat predictable decades , we may be entering into a new era of greater tur@@ bul@@ ence but less pre@@ dict@@ ability on the kore@@ an pen@@ insula .
after the death of ut@@ op@@ ia
a decade ago , people spoke of the end of history , meaning the ultimate tri@@ ump@@ h of a liberal capital@@ ist political order .
nowadays , many sco@@ ff at that notion as too simpl@@ istic .
nonetheless , we are at both the end and beginning of something remarkable .
in the wake of the death of the ut@@ op@@ ian - and often bloo@@ dy - certain@@ ties of the 19th and 20th centuries ( commun@@ ism &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s collapse was but the latest spectacular example ) , and with f@@ ading belief in the liberal welfare state , traditional views about work , retirement , education , the church , solidarity , and other social institutions are changing rapidly .
the central driver of all this is today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s enormous acceler@@ ation in the underlying pace of technological and economic change .
of course , the worldwide crash of high-@@ tech stocks in 2000 ch@@ illed the h@@ ype about a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; new economy &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that seemed to be emerging at the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; end of history . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
but falling share prices should not blind us to the fact that on top of the ongoing information revolution , three fresh waves of revolutionary technology are po@@ ised to hit : bio-@@ technology ( including new medical technologies and genetic engineering , such as the creation of human embry@@ os through cl@@ oning ) , nano@@ technology , and ro@@ bo@@ tics .
each is its own industrial revolution , and will pro@@ found@@ ly alter our lives and ways of thinking .
indeed , the revolution is already upon us .
for the first time in history , a global te@@ ch@@ no-@@ market order is trans@@ forming the world of finance , business , politics and , indeed , physi@@ ology , beyond recognition .
this new te@@ ch@@ no-@@ market system is shaped and characterized by a belief in the increasing importance of knowledge , new ideas , innovations and new technologies , and a higher pace of what the econom@@ ist jo@@ se@@ ph sch@@ ump@@ eter fam@@ ously called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; creative destruction . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
as a result , corporate capitalism is rapidly becoming ob@@ sole@@ te , replaced by a creative capitalism in which entrepreneurship , combined with a greater willingness to adopt innovations , trans@@ forms the business landscape .
innovative start-@@ up firms become huge companies faster than ever before .
but these inf@@ ant gi@@ ants are quickly threatened with ec@@ lip@@ se by even ne@@ wer enterprises .
take the example of computers .
it took 15 years for other countries to compete successfully with ameri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s si@@ lic@@ on valley in semi-@@ conduc@@ tors , but less than five years in internet technology .
this system provides unprecedented financial incentives to scientists and entrepreneurs to aggres@@ sively develop new technologies and thus become rich .
but the revolution is not only for the elite ; it also offers a realistic ( non-@@ ut@@ op@@ ian ) promise of dramatically improved lives for many people around the entire globe - not in 100 years , but in the fore@@ see@@ able future .
we are not@@ just witness@@ ing a simple adaptation of social structures and ways of living to suit new technologies .
the no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate ro@@ bert fo@@ gel argu@@ es that a new syn@@ erg@@ ism between technological and physi@@ ological improvements has produced a radi@@ cally new form of human evolution , which he calls te@@ chno@@ physi@@ o evolution .
only this , fo@@ gel believes , can explain recent trends in lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity , body size , the dur@@ ability of vital organs , and chronic diseases .
these changes are also trig@@ gering changes in human consci@@ ousness .
the result is a lit@@ any of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; post-@@ ut@@ op@@ ian &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; values that include a stronger emphasis on individual freedom and personal responsibility .
in this world without ut@@ op@@ ia , individual freedom is the su@@ preme value .
but , as with any change of such mag@@ nit@@ ude , there are hol@@ dou@@ ts .
indeed , politics everywhere now seems dominated by the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; war of lifest@@ y@@ les &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; that has emerged from today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s emphasis on individual autonomy .
not so long ago , issues such as the environment , the balance of work ver@@ sus leisure in daily life , and the role of marriage , abor@@ tion , and other family concerns were secondary political disputes , as politicians fought over who would receive what share of a nation &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s wealth .
now these issues define domestic political agen@@ das .
this conflict exists globally .
in societies that have been preparing themselves by opening their markets and embra@@ cing universal education , the dis@@ rup@@ tions of this revolution can probably be absor@@ bed and handled .
conflict is most acute in closed societies characterized by a politically repres@@ sive climate and cultur@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed obstacles to growth .
such obstacles include the absence of an informed and capable workforce , inst@@ inc@@ tive m@@ istr@@ ust and rejection of new ideas and technologies just because they come from the west , lack of respect for those who acquire new knowledge , and en@@ demic discrimination against women .
the new battle of lifest@@ y@@ les has given rise to new enemies of open societies , such as the tali@@ ban and al q@@ a@@ eda .
it is no coinci@@ dence that terrorism thri@@ ves in societies that are in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally hosti@@ le to today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s moderni@@ zing values and belief in individual autonomy .
so long as these ideas clas@@ h , violence will l@@ ur@@ k .
to defend post-@@ ut@@ op@@ ian values in the lon@@ ger-@@ term , politicians ( and gener@@ als and sp@@ y@@ masters ) cannot seek security by dras@@ tically cur@@ tail@@ ing fundamental freedoms , because to do so risks for@@ f@@ eit@@ ing public support and a weak@@ ening of the pillars of the post-@@ ut@@ op@@ ian market order .
in challenging groups like al q@@ a@@ eda , they must understand that they are engaged in a war of ideas ; winning the hearts - and the lifest@@ y@@ les - of societies is the only way to win that battle .
after the go@@ d that failed
discussing mor@@ ality and politics , it is said , is like discussing veget@@ ari@@ anism with can@@ ni@@ b@@ als .
much of the public , it seems , thinks this wa@@ y-@@ -@@ for good reason .
moral principles and moral obligations in today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s political / economical real@@ m have undoubtedly gone ast@@ ray , un@@ ash@@ am@@ edly displaced by the interests of profit and power .
the implications are clear .
in today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s world , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; order &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; reflects a balance of interests that is maintained mainly by for@@ ce-@@ -@@ be it military or financial .
but something other than this &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; order of the bar@@ ra@@ cks &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is possible .
think of it as the order of the church cho@@ ir , where individual members cooperate on the basis of a shared culture and values .
one reason for the complete absence of values in &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; power politics &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; nowadays is that leaders get away with speaking words whose true meaning they leave out of their policies .
moreover , sec@@ ular spiritual leaders like g@@ and@@ hi , sch@@ weit@@ zer , and king have van@@ ished , anni@@ hil@@ ated it seems by our new fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ es@@ --@@ success , expe@@ di@@ ency , gain , and special interests .
of course , the so-called civili@@ zed world never managed to create a living ut@@ op@@ ia .
efforts to do so usually ended disastro@@ us@@ ly .
as someone born in the old so@@ vi@@ et union , i know fir@@ sth@@ and the des@@ pair and brut@@ ality of such attempts .
this does not mean that all efforts to build a more moral world are do@@ om@@ ed .
having survi@@ ved an age of extreme ide@@ ologies , such as capitalism , commun@@ ism , and , recently , market fundament@@ alism , most people no longer seek answers in ideological c@@ lich@@ és and the driving , pur@@ i@@ fying force of political certainty .
forced harmon@@ ization is dead , which opens the door to making new voluntary forms of social harmony possible .
let me suggest five steps necessary to begin to bring this about .
the first calls for the world to de@@ em as utter@@ ly unacceptable state violence that seeks to impose conformity and discipline .
such violence is un@@ just on its face because it sup@@ pres@@ ses and intim@@ i@@ dates both body and spirit .
to achieve this end , however , the state must be stri@@ pped of its ability to impose di@@ visi@@ ve dog@@ mas , traditions , and ster@@ eo@@ types .
that can happen only if a carefully cra@@ fted system of &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; checks and balances &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is established , in which powerful organized interest@@ s@@ --@@ states , above all@@ --@@ are restra@@ ined in their efforts at domin@@ ance .
not only political forces need to be checked .
in the r@@ ush to concentrate wealth , for example , majority owners of corporations must not be allowed to harm the interests of minority shareholders , who as a rule are honest common citizens .
this leads me to my second reform priority : a system@@ ic separation of state power and capital .
even in long-@@ established democracies , candidates for elec@@ tive office are not evaluated according to their wisdom and leadership , but according to the size of their campaign war ch@@ ests .
acqu@@ iring government power through possession of capital@@ --@@ and conver@@ ting it into un@@ just economic rent@@ s@@ --@@ must be cur@@ ta@@ iled .
can such a bound@@ ary between power and capital be set ?
yes .
i say this as someone who created significant capital and , having done so , changed her occupation in order to cultiv@@ ate mor@@ ality in politics .
laws can make the separation of capital and political power transparent for all to see .
but the will to achieve this division is , sad@@ ly , ab@@ sent among most people in power .
related to this , it is necessary to separate mass media from both power and the interests of capital .
in europ@@ e , ameri@@ ca , and jap@@ an , media ownership is increasingly concentrated , which rightly wor@@ ries citizens in these countries , particularly when media owners move from forming opinion to forming governments .
how much more worrying , then , is such concentrated ownership in new democracies and developing countries , where the check of civil society is mostly ab@@ sent ?
all these reforms pre@@ sup@@ pose an independent judiciary .
the autonomy of judges must be assured , which requires that their character is such that people trust their decisions .
in states where justice is bought by the rich and powerful , this may impossible , but individual judges can and do stand up to power .
all citizens should support such judicial stal@@ war@@ ts , for their example can re@@ fashion an entire justice system .
in essence , creating a more moral political order requires the removal of money as the decisive factor in politics .
where money rules , some citizens become de@@ pressed and ap@@ ath@@ etic , others become cru@@ el and hear@@ tless , and children learn aggressive behavior .
money should not divide people into political ha@@ ves and ha@@ ve-@@ no@@ ts , or states into successes and failures .
gradually and persist@@ ently , the fundament@@ alism of money must be eliminated .
of course my proposed &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; transform@@ ations &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; may sound too good to be possible .
in defense i wish to c@@ ite the great har@@ v@@ ard phil@@ osop@@ her j@@ oh@@ n ra@@ w@@ ls , who died recently .
theory , no matter how elegant , ra@@ w@@ ls argued , should be dis@@ missed or revised when proven un@@ true .
the cor@@ oll@@ ary to this is that institutions and even world order@@ s@@ --@@ no matter how efficient and success@@ ful@@ --@@ must be reformed if they are un@@ just .
perhaps only someone who comes from one of the post-@@ so@@ vi@@ et states can conc@@ eive of politics in terms of original principles in the manner of ra@@ w@@ ls .
our new@@ born states were given the opportunity to create moral political systems on the ruins of a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; go@@ d that failed . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the struggle to do so has been m@@ igh@@ ty , but despite our trav@@ ail@@ s@@ --@@ and our pover@@ ty-@@ -@@ i believe that my country has the strength to contribute cre@@ atively to this endeavour .
after the golden age of finance
lon@@ don – even after the passage of new financial regulations in the united states , the do@@ d@@ d-@@ fran@@ k act , and the publication of the bas@@ el committee ’ s new capital requirements , the financial sector ’ s prospects over the next few years remain highly uncertain .
there has been some recovery in prices for bank shares from the lows of 2008 , of course , but that r@@ ally fal@@ tered recently .
quite apart from their concerns about the robu@@ st@@ ness of the re@@ bound in the economy , investors are uncertain about many financial firms ’ business models , and about the future size , shape , and profit@@ ability of the financial sector in general .
after all , banks remain deeply un@@ popular in all developed countries .
ban@@ kers are still social par@@ i@@ ah@@ s , as low@@ ly valued by the public as drug dealers or journalists .
they are re@@ vil@@ ed if they lose money , and as@@ sa@@ iled if they make it .
for banks and their shareholders , it looks a case of heads they win , tails we lose . thus , as banks return to profit@@ ability , politicians in north ameri@@ ca and europ@@ e have begun to talk again about new taxes that would sk@@ im those profits off to the benefit of taxpayers , whose support kept banks in business at the height of the crisis .
this is a huge contrast with the financial sector ’ s position in the previous three decades .
from the late 1970 ’ s until 2007 , the financial sector grew far more rapidly than the real economy .
in 1980 , financial assets – stocks , bonds , and bank deposits – total@@ ed around 100 % of g@@ d@@ p in the advanced economies .
by 2007 , the figure was over 400 % in the us , the united king@@ dom , and jap@@ an .
during this period , credit expanded rapidly as a share of g@@ d@@ p , reaching more than 300 % at the peak .
in the uk , the profits of financial intermedi@@ aries , which had aver@@ aged around 1.5 % of the whole economy ’ s profits in the 1970 ’ s , reached 15 % in 2008 .
in the us , bank profits were an even larger share of the total .
this was the golden age of finance .
ban@@ kers ’ pay so@@ ared alongside profits – indeed , it grew even faster .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase willi@@ am wor@@ ds@@ worth , bl@@ iss was it in that da@@ wn to be alive , and to be a derivatives tra@@ der was very hea@@ ven .
but the expansion came to a sh@@ u@@ d@@ dering halt in 2008 , the first year in decades in which aggreg@@ ate financial assets fell , and there is still little sign of a sustained recovery .
is this a short-term phenomenon ?
will the financial sector return to pre-@@ crisis growth rates when the economic situation has been fully stabili@@ zed ?
will financial “ deepening ” continue ?
will bank stocks once again out@@ perform the market ?
a recent study by and@@ y hal@@ dan@@ e and others at the bank of eng@@ land cast@@ s doubt on the prospect of a return to the status quo ante .
they note that the golden age was in fact an unusual period , if you look at the last two centuries of economic history .
hal@@ dan@@ e bases his analysis on the trend in the gross value added ( g@@ va ) of the financial sector .
over the last 160 years , the g@@ va of finance has grown by two percentage points a year faster than that of the economy as a whole .
but this excess growth has not been even@@ ly spread .
during the two decades leading up to world war i , the financial sector grew almost four times faster than the economy , in the first wave of financial deepening and globalization , but from 19@@ 18 until the 1970 ’ s , finance expanded less rapidly than average economic growth .
only when markets were dereg@@ ul@@ ated and liber@@ alized from the early 1970 ’ s onwards did finance once again lea@@ p ahead .
in the us , financial sector g@@ va was only 2 % of the total in the 195@@ 0s , but stands at 8 % today .
hal@@ dan@@ e believes that this growth sp@@ urt is well and truly over .
from a regul@@ ator ’ s perspective , this is a powerful argument for requiring higher capital to constra@@ in the risk that banks can take on .
indeed , the bas@@ el committee plans to require more capital in the future , though the new requirements will be delayed , owing to concerns about the cost and availability of credit to sustain the recovery .
against that background , it is hard to believe that we will quickly return to the head@@ y growth in financial assets , credit , and risk we saw from the 1970 ’ s to 2007 .
finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector returns are likely to be lower .
and lower profit@@ ability will reduce pay more effectively than any direct regulatory controls .
for most of us , unless we remain seriously over@@ weight in financial stocks , this may not be a bad prospect .
we do not want to infl@@ ate another ass@@ et-@@ price bub@@ ble on the scale of the one that bur@@ st in 2007-@@ 2008 .
but there is a risk for regulators and central banks .
if they over-@@ constra@@ in the financial sector , risk may mig@@ rate outside the regulatory frontier , where it will be harder to measure and monitor .
that is why it is important to maintain some flexibility , to allow currently un@@ regulated institutions like he@@ dge funds and priv@@ ate-@@ equity funds to be swe@@ pt into the regulatory net if they become large and system@@ ically important .
the ti@@ ghter their controls on risk in banks , the more frontier police the regulators will need .
after the gre@@ ek default
cam@@ bridge – the gre@@ ek government , the europ@@ ean commission , and the international monetary fund are all den@@ ying what markets perc@@ eive clearly : gre@@ ece will eventually default on its debts to its private and public credi@@ tors .
the politicians prefer to postp@@ one the inevitable by putting public money where private money will no longer go , because doing so allows credi@@ tors to maintain the fic@@ tion that the accounting value of the gre@@ ek bonds that they hold need not be reduced .
that , in turn , avoi@@ ds trig@@ gering requirements of more bank capital .
but , even though the additional loans that gre@@ ece will soon receive from the europ@@ ean union and the im@@ f carry low interest rates , the level of gre@@ ek debt will rise rapidly to un@@ sustainable levels .
that ’ s why market interest rates on priv@@ ately held gre@@ ek bonds and prices for credi@@ t-@@ default sw@@ aps indicate that a massive default is coming .
and a massive default , together with a very large sustained cut in the annual budget deficit , is , in fact , needed to restore gre@@ ek fiscal sustainability .
more specifically , even if a default brings the country ’ s debt down to 60 % of g@@ d@@ p , gre@@ ece would still have to reduce its annual budget deficit from the current 10 % of g@@ d@@ p to about 3 % if it is to prevent the debt ratio from rising again .
in that case , gre@@ ece should be able to finance its future annual government deficits from domestic sources alone .
but fiscal sustainability is no cure for gre@@ ece ’ s chron@@ ically large trade deficit .
gre@@ ece ’ s imports now exceed its exports by more than 4 % of its g@@ d@@ p , the largest trade deficit among eurozone member countries .
if that trade gap pers@@ ists , gre@@ ece will have to bor@@ row the full amount from foreign len@@ ders every year in the future , even if the post-@@ default budget deficits could be financed by borro@@ wing at home .
eliminating or reducing this trade gap without de@@ pressing economic activity and employment in gre@@ ece requires that the country export more and import less .
that , in turn , requires making gre@@ ek goods and services more competitive relative to those of the country ’ s trading partners .
a country with a flexible currency can achieve that by allowing the exchange rate to de@@ preci@@ ate .
but gre@@ ece ’ s membership in the eurozone makes that impossible .
so gre@@ ece faces the difficult task of lower@@ ing the prices of its goods and services relative to those in other countries by other means , namely a large cut in the wages and salaries of gre@@ ek priv@@ ate-@@ sector employees .
but , even if that could be achieved , it would close the trade gap only for as long as gre@@ ek prices remained competitive .
to maintain price competitiveness , the gap between gre@@ ek wage growth and the rise in gre@@ ek productivity – i.e. , output per employee hour – must not be greater than the gap in other eurozone countries .
that will not be easy .
gre@@ ece ’ s trade deficit developed over the past decade because gre@@ ek prices have been rising faster than those of its trading partners .
and that has happened precisely because wages have been rising faster in gre@@ ece , relative to productivity growth , than in other eurozone countries .
to see why it will be difficult for gre@@ ece to remain competitive , assume that the rest of the eurozone experiences annual productivity gains of 2 % , while monetary policy limits annual price inflation to 2 % .
in that case , wages in the rest of the eurozone can rise by 4 % a year .
but if productivity in gre@@ ece rises at just 1 % , gre@@ ek wages can increase at only 3 % .
any higher rate would cause gre@@ ek prices to rise more rapidly than those of its eurozone trading partners .
so gre@@ ece faces a tri@@ ple challenge : the fiscal challenge of cutting its government debt and future deficits ; the pri@@ ce-@@ level challenge of reducing its prices enough to wi@@ pe out the current trade gap ; and the wa@@ ge-@@ productivity challenge of keeping future wage growth below the eurozone average or raising its productivity growth rate .
ever since the gre@@ ek crisis began , the country has shown that it cannot solve its problems as the im@@ f and the europ@@ ean commission had hoped .
the countries that faced similar problems in other parts of the world always combined fiscal contrac@@ tions with currency de@@ valu@@ ations , which membership in a monetary union rules out .
a temporary leave of absence from the eurozone would allow gre@@ ece to achieve a pri@@ ce-@@ level decline relative to other eurozone countries , and would make it easier to adjust the relative price level if gre@@ ek wages cannot be limited .
the ma@@ astri@@ cht treaty explicitly prohib@@ its a eurozone country from leaving the euro , but says nothing about a temporary leave of absence ( and therefore doesn ’ t pro@@ hibit one ) .
it is time for gre@@ ece , other eurozone members , and the europ@@ ean commission to start thinking seriously about that option .
after the g@@ uns of aug@@ ust
the middle east is a place where the dust hardly ever sett@@ les .
when it occasionally does , even for a short inter@@ val – as un resolution 17@@ 01 for c@@ ess@@ ation of hosti@@ lities in le@@ ban@@ on seems to be holding – it is time to take stock of events in the hopes that a responsible debate may influence those in power .
let ’ s start with the united states .
president ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush has been short on neither initiatives nor cat@@ chy slo@@ gan@@ s and ac@@ ron@@ y@@ ms .
recent years are lit@@ tered with them : “ global war on terror ” ( g@@ wo@@ t ) , “ road map , ” “ middle east partnership initiative “ ( me@@ pi ) , “ broader middle east and north afri@@ ca ” ( b@@ men@@ a ) – originally “ greater middle east initiative ( g@@ me@@ i ) – democracy assisted dialogue ( dad ) , and so on .
his latest rever@@ ie , en@@ visi@@ oned in the thick of the recent fighting between isra@@ el and he@@ z@@ bollah , was the new middle east ( n@@ me ) , with us clients isra@@ el , eg@@ yp@@ t , jord@@ an , and sau@@ di arab@@ ia serving as the pillars of regional order .
but like all his previous initiatives since the terrorist attacks on new y@@ or@@ k and wash@@ ington almost five years ago now , the n@@ me ran into trouble from the outset .
secret@@ ary of state con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zza rice announced its birth while re@@ jecting an immediate ceas@@ e@@ fire in le@@ ban@@ on .
her poor timing made the initiative appear hear@@ tless , as thousands of civilians were being u@@ proo@@ ted , killed , or ma@@ im@@ ed by isra@@ el ’ s efficient but ru@@ th@@ less arti@@ ll@@ ery and air force .
this so embar@@ rass@@ ed the three ar@@ ab n@@ me partners that each ra@@ ced to distance itself from the us-@@ spon@@ sored initiative .
sau@@ di arab@@ ia , which had remained silent for nearly two weeks , did so with a $ 500 million contribution to re@@ building dev@@ ast@@ ated areas of le@@ ban@@ on and another billion to support le@@ ban@@ on ’ s threatened currency .
eg@@ yp@@ t ’ s h@@ eir apparent gam@@ al mu@@ bar@@ ak followed suit in the fourth week of the fighting by heading a 7@@ 0-@@ member delegation on a solidarity visit to bei@@ ru@@ t .
but , rather than ear@@ ning him the respect of an ou@@ trag@@ ed eg@@ yp@@ tian public , re@@ vel@@ ations in the opposition press that his plane had to obtain a safe passage and authority to land from the isra@@ eli@@ s gar@@ ner@@ ed only ho@@ w@@ ls of der@@ ision .
as for ameri@@ ca , anything it tou@@ ches in the middle east has become radioactive , even for long@@ standing clients and friends .
in the course of man@@ eu@@ ver@@ ing to delay the un ceas@@ e@@ fire , b@@ ush and rice continually reiterated the need for a security council resolution that deals for@@ ce@@ fully with “ the roots of the problem . ”
of course , for them and for isra@@ el , this was he@@ z@@ bollah and the need to eradic@@ ate or at a minimum dis@@ arm it and force its figh@@ ters to a safe distance from settlements and towns in northern isra@@ el .
while this is a reasonable demand , the rest of the middle east – and , indeed , much of the world , including europ@@ e – regard the root cause of the conflict as isra@@ eli in@@ transi@@ gence and arro@@ gan@@ ce , together with ameri@@ ca ’ s blind support for it .
both ameri@@ ca and isra@@ el have c@@ ited foo@@ t-@@ dra@@ gging in implementing un resolution 15@@ 59 , which calls for dis@@ arming all non-@@ state actors in le@@ ban@@ on and the deployment of government forces all the way to the southern border .
but for years the us and isra@@ el have not utter@@ ed a word about the doz@@ ens of un resolutions , going back as far as resolution 49 on partition in 19@@ 47 , which called for the establishment of distinct ar@@ ab and je@@ wish states on roughly half of mand@@ ated pal@@ est@@ ine .
this and numerous other resolutions seeking red@@ ress for in@@ justi@@ ces toward pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans have been ignored by the us .
thus , for 300 million arab@@ s and more than one billion mus@@ li@@ ms the “ root cause ” of the middle east conflict is not he@@ z@@ bollah .
as its leader , h@@ ass@@ an nas@@ r@@ al@@ lah ap@@ tly put it , “ we are just a reaction to chronic in@@ justice . ”
it may well be that there is more than one root cause – every party to the conflict has a favorite one .
there is no point in bel@@ ab@@ oring whose pain is greater or whose root cause is deeper .
in fact , argu@@ ing over grie@@ v@@ ances merely drives the sides further apart .
the long over@@ due un resolution 17@@ 01 may , with its adoption , indicate that all parties are f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , or could no longer with@@ stand international pressure .
this is good news for all concerned and provides an opportunity to tackle each party ’ s “ root cause . ”
sei@@ zing the opportunity requires that hum@@ ility rather than moral su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy prev@@ ails .
em@@ pa@@ thy , not eth@@ no@@ centr@@ ism , should be the order of the day now that the g@@ uns are falling silent and we have re@@ discovered the limits of military force .
but if we have learned anything at all from the tragic ass@@ assin@@ ations of the region ’ s greatest peac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers , an@@ war sad@@ at and y@@ itz@@ ha@@ k ra@@ bin , it is that the g@@ uns do not remain silent for long .
during any l@@ ull , a fan@@ atic from either side could j@@ ump to center stage and , through an act of utter ma@@ dness , k@@ ick up the sett@@ ling dust and d@@ ash the hopes of the many on both sides who still long for a lasting peace .
cam@@ bridge – in 2000 , 18@@ 9 countries collecti@@ vely adopted the united nations mill@@ enni@@ um declaration , which evol@@ ved into a set of concrete targets called the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals ( m@@ d@@ gs ) .
these ambitious targets – ranging from hal@@ ving extreme poverty and reducing mat@@ ern@@ al mortality by three-@@ quarters to achieving universal primary scho@@ oling and hal@@ ting ( and beginning to reverse ) the spread of hi@@ v / aids – are supposed to be met by the end of 2015 .
as the deadline approaches , development experts are debating a new question : what comes next ?
it is virtually certain that many of the m@@ d@@ gs will not have been met by the end of 2015 , but there have been striking successes in some areas .
for example , the goal of hal@@ ving extreme poverty ( measured by the number of people living on less than $ 1.@@ 25 a day ) will likely be achieved ahead of time , largely thanks to ch@@ ina ’ s phenom@@ en@@ al growth .
at the same time , there is little evidence to suggest that those successes were the result of the m@@ d@@ gs themselves .
ch@@ ina implemented the policies that engine@@ ered history ’ s greatest poverty eradication program prior to , and independently from , the mill@@ enni@@ um declaration and the m@@ d@@ gs .
clearly , however , the m@@ d@@ gs were a public-@@ relations tri@@ ump@@ h , which is not to bel@@ it@@ tle their contribution .
like all worth@@ while p@@ r efforts , the m@@ d@@ gs served to raise awareness , gal@@ v@@ ani@@ ze attention , and mobili@@ ze action – all for a good cause .
they amp@@ li@@ fied the global convers@@ ation about development and defined its terms .
and there is evidence that they got advanced countries to pay more attention to poor nations .
indeed , the m@@ d@@ gs possibly had their cle@@ arest impact on aid flows from rich to poor countries .
a study by char@@ les kenn@@ y and and@@ y sum@@ ner for the center for global development in wash@@ ington , d@@ c , suggests that the m@@ d@@ gs not only boo@@ sted aid flows , but also re@@ directed them toward smaller , poorer countries , and toward targeted areas like education and public health .
however , aid was not directly linked to performance and results , and it is much more difficult to know whether it had the desired impact overall .
the m@@ d@@ gs encomp@@ ass eight goals , 21 targets , and 60 indicators .
much criticism has focused on the use of these num@@ eri@@ cal targets and indicators , which , skep@@ tics argue , are mis@@ specified , mis@@ measured , and diver@@ t attention from equally important areas .
but these complaints miss the point .
any effort that is concrete and imple@@ ment@@ able needs to monitor the results , and setting clear num@@ eri@@ cal targets is the best way to do so .
still , a central parado@@ x pla@@ gues the m@@ d@@ gs .
the mill@@ enni@@ um declaration was meant to be a compact between the world ’ s rich and poor countries .
poor countries promised to re@@ focus their development efforts while rich countries ple@@ dged to support them with finance , technology , and access to their markets .
but , od@@ dly , of the eight goals , only the last one deals with “ global partnership , ” or what rich countries can and should do .
even here , the m@@ d@@ gs contain no num@@ eri@@ cal target for financial aid or any other aspect of rich countries ’ assistance , in contrast to the highly specific pover@@ ty-@@ related targets set for developing countries .
it is perhaps telling that the “ progress char@@ ts ” prepared by the united nations development program , the agency charged with reporting on progress toward achieving the m@@ d@@ gs , track only internet usage under that goal .
why we need a global effort to convince developing countries to do what is good for them is not clear .
poverty reduction and human development should be the first order of business for governments in these countries , with or without the m@@ d@@ gs .
it is true , of course , that these governments often pursue different goals , for political , military , and other reasons .
but it is w@@ ish@@ ful thinking to believe that they can be persu@@ aded to act otherwise by international declarations that lack enforcement mechanisms .
if we have learned one thing in the development business , it is that real reform cannot be bought with donors ’ money , let alone with v@@ ague promises of money .
equally problematic , the m@@ d@@ gs imp@@ lic@@ itly assume that we know how to achieve development targets , and that only resources and political will are missing .
but it is doub@@ tful that even well-@@ inten@@ tioned policymakers have a good handle on , say , how to raise secon@@ dar@@ y-@@ school completion rates sustain@@ ably or reduce mat@@ ern@@ al mortality .
many development economists would argue that significant improvements in governance and political institutions are required before such goals can be achieved .
the most that rich countries can do is to provide an enabling environment for the benefit of developing countries that are willing and able to take advantage of it .
these considerations suggest an obvious direction for the next iter@@ ation of the m@@ d@@ gs .
first , a new global compact should focus more directly on rich countries ’ responsibilities .
second , it should emphasize policies beyond aid and trade that have an equal , if not greater , impact on poor countries ’ development prospects .
a short list of such policies would include : carbon taxes and other measures to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate climate change ; more work visas to allow larger temporary migration flows from poor countries ; strict controls on arms sales to developing nations ; reduced support for repres@@ sive regimes ; and improved sharing of financial information to reduce money laundering and tax avoid@@ ance .
notice that most of these measures are actually aimed at reducing damage – for example , climate change , military conflict , and financial crime – that otherwise results from rich countries ’ conduct .
“ do no harm ” is as good a principle here as it is in medicine .
this kind of re@@ orientation will not be easy .
advanced countries are certain to resist any new commitments .
but most of these measures do not cost money , and , as the m@@ d@@ gs have shown , setting targets can be used to mobili@@ ze action from rich@@ -@@ country governments .
if the international community is going to invest in a bold new public-@@ relations initiative , it might as well focus on areas where the potential pay@@ off@@ s are the greatest .
after the promised land
lon@@ don – at the height of the ar@@ ab u@@ pris@@ ings last spring , many europ@@ e@@ ans were gri@@ pped by night@@ mare visions of a ts@@ un@@ ami of migrants cr@@ ash@@ ing against the continent ’ s shores .
the wave never hit , but its spec@@ ter fed a ten@@ ac@@ ious anti-@@ im@@ migrant popul@@ ism that has conce@@ aled an important new trend : migration to europ@@ e – and to the united states – has largely st@@ alled .
in many countries , more immigrants are leaving than are arriving , owing mainly to the economic crisis that has dra@@ ined jobs in the west .
that re@@ versal is one of the great under-@@ reported stories of 2011 ( and of the prec@@ eding two years ) , and the numbers are star@@ tling . consider sp@@ ain , which is on track to lose more than a half-@@ million residents by 2020 .
by contrast , between 2002 and 2008 , sp@@ ain ’ s population grew by 7@@ 00@@ ,000 a year , driven largely by immigration .
the trends are similar elsewhere in europ@@ e .
while this fact alone will not quiet opponents of immigration , it does give countries more brea@@ thing room to repair and strengthen badly broken systems for receiving and integrating new@@ com@@ ers .
although rapidly aging western countries are unable to attract the immigrants they need , they allow millions who are already there to suffer discrimination and abuse .
de@@ ten@@ tions and de@@ port@@ ations take place under sometimes terrible conditions .
mean@@ while , the international community collecti@@ vely fails to protect vast populations of vulnerable migrants , such as the millions str@@ anded by the recent conflicts in north afri@@ ca .
undoubtedly , rising anti-@@ im@@ migrant popul@@ ism must be confronted .
while poll@@ ing suggests that attitudes are influenced more by eth@@ ni@@ city than religion , both help to define identi@@ ties and min@@ d@@ sets .
political parties in fran@@ ce , swit@@ zer@@ land , and the ne@@ ther@@ lands ( to name a few ) have run successful campaigns that s@@ cap@@ ego@@ at immigrants .
moreover , governments from al@@ ab@@ ama to hung@@ ary are passing laws that undermine what should be migrants ’ rights .
ital@@ y recently adopted har@@ sh “ emergency ” decre@@ es that target migrants by making un@@ documented entry and residence a criminal offen@@ se .
europ@@ ean leaders trip over themselves to declare , one more for@@ ce@@ fully than the next , that multi@@ cultur@@ alism is dead .
dut@@ ch politi@@ cian ge@@ ert wil@@ ders , whose freedom party is inform@@ ally part of the governing coalition , did them one better by being charged with inc@@ itement to anti-@@ mus@@ li@@ m hat@@ red .
in the us , al@@ lig@@ ator@@ -@@ filled mo@@ ats and electri@@ fied border f@@ ences have featured in the current presidential campaign .
such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political grati@@ fication , but their net result is to cle@@ a@@ ve societies whose cohesion is already seriously challeng@@ ed by the economic crisis .
growing discrimination in employment , housing , and education affects not just immigrants and their children ; it har@@ ms our societies as a whole .
with the l@@ ull in net immigration , we now have a window of opportunity to address these shortcomings .
deb@@ un@@ king the my@@ ths about migration – that most immigrants enter un@@ law@@ fully , for example , or that immigration dis@@ places existing workers – would be a good place to start .
it would also be useful to explain that immigration is necessary for prosperity and growth in almost all o@@ ec@@ d countries .
if aging societies in the west and elsewhere ( like jap@@ an ) fail to get immigration right , they will be wo@@ efully un@@ prepared when they confront the real ti@@ dal wave : the retirement of baby bo@@ om@@ ers in the coming two decades .
the gaps in these countries ’ labor markets – from software specialists to physi@@ cians to home health ai@@ des – will be immense .
the europ@@ ean union ’ s labor force will decline by almost 70 million workers in the next 40 years ; in the absence of significant net immigration ( combined with a much higher retirement age ) , europ@@ ean economies and social safety nets will sh@@ ri@@ vel .
the priorities are clear .
we need to understand better how our economies will evol@@ ve in the coming decades , and to re@@ design our educational systems to produce workers with us@@ able skills .
and , where it is clear that immigrants will be needed , we must be able to identify , welcome , integrate , and protect them .
mean@@ while , our most fundamental institutions – schools , police , and the courts – must be re-@@ engine@@ ered to reflect and respond to the diversity of our communities , which is now a fact of life .
countries must learn to work together to achieve these goals , few of which can be reached by going it alone .
if our tool@@ box were empty , our in@@ action might be understandable .
but examples of smart migration practices abo@@ und .
can@@ ada and the p@@ hili@@ pp@@ ines , for instance , have a well-@@ functioning acc@@ ord that protects the rights of temporary workers .
s@@ weden has developed legislation that minim@@ iz@@ es bureaucracy for companies that need foreign workers .
and important advances have been made in ensuring that im@@ migrant children receive the education that they need to become full members of society .
progress is being made on the global level as well , despite the economic crisis and popul@@ ist head@@ win@@ ds .
in jun@@ e , the international labor organization ’ s member states overwhel@@ m@@ ingly approved the domestic workers convention , which will significantly increase protec@@ tions for a vulnerable group of workers – the majority of whom are migrants .
mean@@ while , the global forum on migration and development , established in 2007 , has quickly become an important means of fostering knowledge and partnerships .
the reason for growing international cooperation is simple : countries everywhere are affected by migration , and , increasingly , they are experiencing immigration and em@@ ig@@ ration simultaneously .
indeed , roughly one-@@ third of migrants nowadays move between developed countries ; one-@@ third move between developing countries ; and only one-@@ third move from the developing to the developed world .
highly skilled workers , such as ban@@ kers and engineers , are flo@@ cking to ch@@ ina .
m@@ ex@@ ico , known primarily as a country of em@@ ig@@ ration , is home to millions of migrants from central ameri@@ ca .
millions of people in sou@@ theast a@@ sia venture to the middle east to work , but millions more cross borders within the region .
the list goes on .
when it comes to migration , we are all in the same boat – and that boat is le@@ aking .
starting in 2012 , countries should re@@ double their efforts to fix it .
after the tali@@ ban
`@@ `@@ failed state &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; is a term applied frequently to afgh@@ an@@ istan and is often deemed the cause for why terrorists gained such influence there .
but a country does not fail of its own vo@@ lition , nor is it weak@@ ened by unknown causes .
a country fails , when it fails , for definite , identi@@ fiable reasons .
these must be addressed if afgh@@ an@@ istan is to be revi@@ ved .
twenty years of invasion , civil war , and d@@ rought have left afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s institutions in ru@@ in .
millions of afgh@@ ans hu@@ ddle in refugee camps or are displaced from their homes .

for these and many other reasons , re@@ building afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economy will require not only economic reconstruction but an effort to re@@ inv@@ ent the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s political and cultural institutions .
such a massive effort will be do@@ om@@ ed to failure , however , if afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s neigh@@ b@@ ors intervene in ways that promote economic up@@ heav@@ al all over again .
afgh@@ an@@ istan is no place for quick fi@@ xes .

any thought that the anti-@@ terror coalition will be able to ba@@ il out fast ( as the west did when it abandoned afgh@@ an@@ istan to its fate after the so@@ vi@@ et withdrawal ten years ago ) should be forgotten .
the west must stick with afgh@@ an@@ istan until its reconstruction is established .
otherwise , it runs the risk of renewed cha@@ os and violence , but this time in a more dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zed region , as pak@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s current problems demonstrate .
three problems are of immediate concern , the most important being feeding the afgh@@ an people - both within the country and in refugee camps outside afgh@@ an@@ istan .
humanitarian aid is being delivered , but a distribution system safe from the pre@@ d@@ ations of afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s war@@ l@@ ords needs to be built .
indeed , the war@@ l@@ ords have been given too big a say in distribut@@ ing aid already , and it may be hard to strip them of this power .
but stri@@ pped they must be .
the second problem involves re@@ locating afgh@@ an refugees now living in pak@@ istan and ir@@ an , as well as those displaced within afgh@@ an@@ istan .
to achieve this goal , the agricultural economy must be revi@@ ved in order to revi@@ ve this industry , providing jobs and food for people .
a massive impe@@ di@@ ment here is the millions of mines left over from the so@@ vi@@ et invasion that must be removed .
the west has a big incentive to be generous to afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s rural poor .
star@@ ving farmers , if un@@ assisted , may return to cultiv@@ ating a very reliable cash crop : the op@@ ium po@@ ppy , long a st@@ ap@@ le of the war@@ l@@ ord economy .
eliminating it will not only help farmers and the west as it tries to cur@@ tail her@@ o@@ in use , but also afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s inf@@ ant government as it stru@@ gg@@ les to asser@@ t its national authority against the war@@ l@@ ords .
a bank@@ rupt war@@ l@@ ord , after all , cannot buy weapons or bri@@ be people to maintain their loy@@ alty .
major infrastructure investments will also be needed if the economy is to be revi@@ ved .
housing , particularly for returning refugees , will need to be constructed fast .
cities such as kab@@ ul , ma@@ z@@ ar , her@@ at and others will need to be re@@ built as centers of economic and cultural life .
village housing must be provided at a massive level .
roads , airports and communications systems must also be rev@@ itali@@ zed if trade is to be restored .
the educational system needs to be re@@ built almost from scrat@@ ch , and with so many women anxi@@ ous to return to teaching , a revi@@ ved educational system will also help afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s democratic politicians gain a powerful lobby of workers .
particular attention should be given to ele@@ mentary schools and libraries outside of cities .
afgh@@ an@@ istan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction , as it is not a society with a strong political center .
plann@@ ers should take advantage of the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s decentr@@ alized nature and emphasize private sector participation in reconstruction .
a decentr@@ alized system will respond better to local needs and avoid an over-@@ bureaucratic public sector .
but autonomous economic regions should be avoided as a threat to afgh@@ an national unity because they would play into the hands of the war@@ l@@ ords .
moreover , poorer regions would do badly in such a system .
in the long run , afgh@@ an@@ istan has resources that can be exploited .
there is the potential for oil and gas expl@@ oration , and of mining iron ore and precious metals .
these activities should be explo@@ red in a framework of economic development across central a@@ sia .
afgh@@ an@@ istan , indeed , must be integrated into the regional pipeline and other development schemes .
afgh@@ ans can contribute in a tangible way here by re@@ opening the north-@@ south route connecting the resource rich economies of central a@@ sia to den@@ sely populated indi@@ a and pak@@ istan .
none of this will be possible unless afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s young m@@ ales are dis@@ armed and given productive work .
essential here , is to attract exp@@ atri@@ ate afgh@@ ans with skills and professional achievements to help in re@@ building the country by establishing small firms that will su@@ ck up the unemployed .
exp@@ atri@@ ate involvement will also likely support the rights of women to participate fully and legally in economic and political life , as was the case before 1978 .
finally , donor countries must apply the lessons learned in restoring the war@@ -@@ ra@@ v@@ aged states of the former y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via .
grants and planning must be coordinated , and the consent of afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s neighbor@@ ing countries assured .
if the latter are ignored , regional interests can inc@@ ite cha@@ os once again .
an international conference on afgh@@ an@@ istan should be called by the us and held under un au@@ spices .
it must affir@@ m not only afgh@@ an@@ istan &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s territorial integrity , but ins@@ ure that donor commitments meet the scale of the job and that these promises are kept .
a decade ago , the west turned its back on afgh@@ an@@ istan and cha@@ os ensu@@ ed .
to abandon the country again would be criminal fol@@ ly .
after the war on terror
new y@@ or@@ k – the basic out@@ lines of bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s approach to foreign policy became clear in 2009 .
his administration believes that the united states should talk with other governments even if it dis@@ agrees pro@@ found@@ ly with their character .
he pre@@ fers acting with other countries to going it alone .
and he has shi@@ fted the focus of us foreign policy from what countries do within their borders to how they act beyond them .
all of this differenti@@ ates ob@@ ama from his immediate predec@@ essor , ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush , whose administration br@@ anded selected countries as evil and mostly refused to deal with them ; often rejected cooperation with other governments , l@@ est the us find itself constra@@ ined ; and sought to transform other countries , rather than to influence their actions .
any parall@@ els between ob@@ ama ’ s foreign policy and that of b@@ ush are more with the father , ameri@@ ca ’ s 4@@ 1st president , ge@@ or@@ ge h@@ .@@ w. b@@ ush .
diplomacy , of course , should not be viewed as a favor or conc@@ ession that signals “ so@@ f@@ tness . ”
ob@@ ama rightly recogni@@ zes that it is an important tool of foreign policy , to be employed when it promises results that are more favor@@ able than the alternatives .
ob@@ ama is also correct that acting in concert with others is almost always desirable .
the challenges that most define this era – nuclear proliferation , terrorism , global climate change , and pan@@ demic disease – can be managed only collecti@@ vely .
moreover , the reality is that the us is now too stret@@ ched economically and milit@@ arily to succeed by rel@@ ying solely on its own resources .
finally , ob@@ ama is right to focus more on the behavior of countries than on their nature .
it is not just that the assistance of o@@ di@@ ous governments is sometimes essential ; it is also that there is nothing more difficult than re@@ making the internal work@@ ings of other societies .
yet , even with these adjustments , and despite ob@@ ama ’ s communication skills and his personal popularity ( reflected in his no@@ bel peace prize and in declining anti-@@ ameri@@ can@@ ism around the world ) , 2009 was a difficult first year for his administration ’ s foreign policy .
to begin with , a willingness to talk to governments does not always translate into an ability to work with them .
the us has shown new flexibility with ir@@ an and north korea , but neither has reciproc@@ ated so far .
reason@@ abl@@ eness does not always yield results .
simil@@ arly , countries often choose not to cooperate .
ch@@ ina , for example , res@@ ists using its influence with north korea , f@@ ear@@ ing that instability on the kore@@ an pen@@ insula could lead to large refugee flows into ch@@ ina or a united korea al@@ lied with the us .
ch@@ ina pre@@ fers an im@@ perfect status quo to such alternatives .
for its part , rus@@ sia appears reluc@@ tant to pressure ir@@ an to re@@ ining in its nuclear ambitions .
ob@@ ama has worked hard to improve us-@@ rus@@ sian ties : bilateral arms control is again a priority , and the president agreed to alter plans for anti-@@ missi@@ le deplo@@ y@@ ments in pol@@ and and the cz@@ ech re@@ public .
but rus@@ sian leaders resist tough sanctions on ir@@ an , l@@ est they jeop@@ ardi@@ ze financial deal@@ ings there and lead to increased ir@@ anian support for mus@@ li@@ m minorities inside rus@@ sia .
as a result , it will be difficult in 2010 and beyond to develop an effective package of sanctions and incentives that enjoys broad international backing .
simil@@ arly , when it came to negotiating a new pact to mitig@@ ate global climate change , diplomatic efforts had to conten@@ d with international dis@@ cor@@ d in 2009 , forcing leaders to postp@@ one their efforts yet again .
with developing countries f@@ ear@@ ing the impact of binding limits on carbon emissions on their economic growth , and with insufficient support in the us congress , a global treaty appears unlikely in 2010 as well .
in the middle east , despite ob@@ ama ’ s vo@@ w to re-@@ start the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ pal@@ est@@ inian peace process , progress remained sty@@ mi@@ ed by differences over the scope and content of an agreement and how to bring it about .
the lack of forward movement st@@ ems not just from dis@@ agreement over goals , but also from the in@@ ability of a divided pal@@ est@@ inian leadership to compromise .
weak pro@@ tagon@@ ists make poor participants in peace negotiations .
moreover , other countries ’ domestic politics do matter for what ob@@ ama can accompl@@ ish .
afgh@@ an@@ istan ’ s often cor@@ rupt and in@@ competent government under@@ mines counter-@@ ins@@ urgency efforts there .
pak@@ istan ’ s government does not share the same threat assessments or priorities as its ameri@@ can bene@@ factor .
no amount of increased ameri@@ can military effort is likely to offset the resulting lack of progress in weak@@ ening extremis@@ ts in both countries .
domestic politics in the us is also getting in the way of ob@@ ama ’ s foreign@@ -@@ policy goals .
the absence of consensus on climate change , or resistance in congress to new trade agreements , weak@@ ens the president ’ s hand .
and ameri@@ ca ’ s un@@ willingness to take meaningful steps to reduce its bal@@ lo@@ oning fiscal deficit further under@@ mines the effectiveness of its foreign policy .
finally , some of what the ob@@ ama administration chose to do ( sin@@ gling out isra@@ eli settlements , for example ) and how it did it ( gu@@ ant@@ ánam@@ o comes to mind ) made tough situations tou@@ gher .
but the larger truth is that the world has become a more difficult place to manage , much less to lead .
the post-@@ cold war era of us uni@@ pol@@ arity has ended , owing to ameri@@ ca ’ s economic mis@@ management , the war in i@@ ra@@ q , the continuing rise of other countries , and globalization .
there are bright spots , of course .
ameri@@ ca ’ s relations with other major powers – ch@@ ina , indi@@ a , jap@@ an , rus@@ sia , europ@@ e , and bra@@ zi@@ l – are at least as cooperative as they are competitive ; conflict between such major powers , the dominant characteristic of the international order in the twen@@ tieth century , is unlikely .
it is also possible that some of today ’ s most closed countries , including ir@@ an , north korea , bur@@ ma , cu@@ ba , and vene@@ zu@@ ela , will become more open and less threatening with time .
on balance , though , early evidence suggests that this will not be an era of smooth multilater@@ alism or ameri@@ can leadership .
something more complicated , and un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy , appears increasingly likely .
bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s next three years in office ( or seven , if he is re-@@ elected in 2012 ) will likely be characterized as much by frustr@@ ation as by accompl@@ ishment .
a future for the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s cor@@ al re@@ efs ?
cor@@ al re@@ efs are the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s most bi@@ ologically rich marine eco@@ systems , har@@ bor@@ ing some of the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s most beautiful organisms .
they provide the principal source of protein for over ten million people worldwide .
re@@ ef@@ -based activities ( princip@@ ally fishing and tourism ) form the economic live@@ lihood of millions more .
clearly , the human costs of a worldwide break@@ down of these eco@@ systems are enormous .
yet global deterioration of cor@@ al re@@ efs is severe and ongoing .
wholesale dis@@ integration of re@@ ef eco@@ systems has occurred in some places , and collapse on a worldwide scale is a real risk .
but there is some good news , too : we know what steps the international community can take now to protect and restore re@@ efs &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; `@@ `@@ re@@ sili@@ ence &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; -- their capacity to maintain integrity in the face of the environmental fluctu@@ ations that are a natural part of life in any eco@@ system .
we must medi@@ ate the sever@@ ity of global warming , while simultaneously con@@ serving the re@@ sili@@ ence of cor@@ al re@@ efs .
histor@@ ically , the principal agents of re@@ ef degra@@ dation have been over-@@ fishing and pollution , not global warming .
in healthy eco@@ systems , when pre@@ y numbers decline , pre@@ dat@@ ors become mal@@ no@@ ur@@ ished , and their numbers decline , too , giving their pre@@ y a chance to recover .
but human pre@@ dat@@ ors are different . when our pre@@ y numbers decline , their economic value tends to increase , so fishing intensi@@ fies .
this means that once pre@@ dat@@ or species become deple@@ ted , fishing pressure shi@@ fts towards plant@@ -@@ eating fish species , leading to pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ous dec@@ lines in the numbers of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res on cor@@ al re@@ efs .
her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous fish are key players on cor@@ al re@@ efs .
when cor@@ al populations decline in the after@@ math of cycl@@ ones , diseases , and other distur@@ ban@@ ces , it is the her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res that keep se@@ a@@ we@@ ed in check , and allow cor@@ al populations to recover .
without them , fast-@@ growing se@@ a@@ we@@ ed quickly monopoli@@ zes space on the re@@ ef , preventing restoration of healthy quantities of cor@@ al cover .
because cor@@ als provide the habit@@ at structure on which other re@@ ef organisms depend , the decre@@ ases in cor@@ al cover lead to big decre@@ ases in a re@@ ef &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s biodiversity .
pollution by nutri@@ ents and tox@@ ins from adjacent land areas further vi@@ ti@@ ate cor@@ al populations &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; ability to recover , giving se@@ a@@ we@@ ed an even greater competitive edge .
cor@@ als are formed by a sym@@ bio@@ sis between an animal and a one-@@ cell@@ ed plant .
the animal provides shel@@ ter and nutri@@ ents for the plant ; the plant conver@@ ts sun@@ light into energy , which it shares with the animal .
for reasons that are not yet fully understood , this partnership breaks down when cor@@ als experience un@@ usually high temperatures .
the plant is exp@@ elled , and cor@@ als turn a brilliant white color .
if temperatures soon return to normal , the partnership can be restored .
but if cor@@ als remain `@@ `@@ ble@@ ached &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; for too long , they die .
for many species of cor@@ al , this ble@@ aching threshold is usually only a couple of degrees c@@ enti@@ grade above the typical maximum temperature for a given location .
interpreted in light of even the most optimistic global warming scenarios , this is distur@@ bing news .
if cor@@ al ble@@ aching thresh@@ olds remain steady , local summer temperatures will exceed those thresh@@ olds regularly within a few decades .
cor@@ als grow slowly , so re@@ efs su@@ sta@@ ining severe ble@@ aching will not recover before they ble@@ ach again .
fortunately , there is evidence that ble@@ aching thresh@@ olds evol@@ ve .
most cor@@ al species have broad geographical distribu@@ tions , and ble@@ ach at different temperatures depending on location .
many species that ble@@ ach at 28@@ o or 29@@ o c@@ enti@@ grade on au@@ str@@ alia &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s great barrier re@@ ef rout@@ inely toler@@ ate temperatures of 34@@ o or more in the arab@@ ian sea .
unfortunately , we do not know how long it takes for such adaptation to occur .
two things can be done to protect cor@@ al re@@ efs .
the first is obvious : minim@@ ize global warming by , say , hon@@ oring the k@@ yo@@ to treaty &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s emissions targets .
second , we must restore cor@@ al re@@ efs &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; capacity to cope with environmental change@@ --@@ their re@@ sili@@ en@@ ce-@@ -@@ by protecting the fish stocks that keep se@@ a@@ we@@ ed in check , and thereby facilitate the recovery of cor@@ al populations from ble@@ aching .
these recovery phases enable adap@@ tations to higher temperatures to spread .
without fish , se@@ a@@ we@@ ed domin@@ ance will prevent that recovery .
the catastro@@ p@@ hic collapse of fish stocks around the world-@@ -@@ on cor@@ al re@@ efs and el@@ se@@ wher@@ e-@@ -@@ has provided hard lessons about managing fisheries .
many intensi@@ vely regulated fisheries have collap@@ sed along with the un@@ regulated ones .
as fish populations in these no-@@ take zones recover , they create `@@ `@@ sp@@ ill-@@ over &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; effects , with catches often increasing in areas outside the no-@@ take zones .
more importantly , they provide a refu@@ ge for fish populations , a kind of insurance policy against stock collapse .
on cor@@ al re@@ efs , these no-@@ take zones can help ins@@ ure that a portion of cor@@ al re@@ ef habit@@ at su@@ sta@@ ins a healthy fish community , and secure the cor@@ al re@@ ef re@@ sili@@ ence that this brings .
scientific evidence indicates that , to be effective , 30-@@ 50 % of available habit@@ at should be set aside as no-@@ take zones .
this figure is far higher than levels of protection in even the weal@@ thi@@ est countries that har@@ bor significant cor@@ al re@@ efs , the us and au@@ str@@ alia , where current levels of protection are less than 5 % .
given the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the threat to the world &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s cor@@ al re@@ efs , the international community &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s response has been fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly slow .
but there is some encouraging news : in jun@@ e , au@@ str@@ alia &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s government proposed a major increase in no-@@ take areas within the great barrier re@@ ef to over 30 % .
if adopted , this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps prompt other nations to follow suit .
the future of tropical marine eco@@ systems , and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them , depend on it .
a future without prece@@ dent
jer@@ usalem – in my nearly nine decades of life , i cannot recall a time in which the past was so ir@@ relevant to policy@@ making .
all of today ’ s significant developments went un@@ predic@@ ted by anyone .
experts studied the past , but , constra@@ ined by old para@@ dig@@ ms , they could not disc@@ ern the future .
today ’ s dynamic complexity , in which a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ based , fast-@@ changing global economy makes so many more phenomena inter@@ dependent , prevents us from fore@@ seeing the future through linear extra@@ pol@@ ations of the past .
the only certainty is that the future will be defined by scientific progress and innovation , which cannot be known ahead of time .
as a result , the traditional power of states and leaders is declining ; in today ’ s global economy , innov@@ ators , not politicians , wi@@ eld the most influence .
the glob@@ alized economy affects every state , yet no single state can determine the outcomes , because science and technology are bor@@ der@@ less .
global companies wish to do business worldwide , ero@@ ding not just sovereignty , but also racism and prejudice , as well as significantly weak@@ ening nation@@ alism .
this transformation has placed the world in the hands of a younger generation , more technologi@@ cally sav@@ vy than their parents and connected to one another through social networks that are not confined by territory , language , or government .
the young leaders who created fac@@ ebook and goo@@ gle have had a greater global impact than many stat@@ es@@ men and gener@@ als .
these young people are also the leaders of erup@@ ting political protest movements .
the “ ar@@ ab spring , ” the tent demonstrations in isra@@ el , occup@@ y wall street , and the protests in rus@@ sia reveal not a clas@@ h of civi@@ liz@@ ations , but a battle of generations .
the young generation under@@ stands that the way states and economies are currently run is un@@ fit for the new era .
yet there are political “ hit@@ ch@@ hi@@ kers ” who want to exploit the recent aw@@ ak@@ ening , not by promoting an agenda of freedom , but by imposing a different type of co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
in the ar@@ ab world , it is mainly extreme islam@@ ists who are hi@@ j@@ acking the young generation ’ s wave , ste@@ aling their revolution .
isra@@ el has re@@ acted positively to the will of the young generation , but it cannot and should not intervene in events in the ar@@ ab world .
our hearts are with the reb@@ elling yo@@ ung@@ sters and their legitimate year@@ ning for freedom and basic rights to express themselves , choose their leaders , and earn their own living .
isra@@ eli@@ s wait for the day when our country will no longer be the region ’ s only democracy , because being an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty is un@@ natural .
yet there is a real concern that the extremis@@ ts , who are politically well organized , are seeking to gain control by the bal@@ lot over less@@ -@@ organized liber@@ als , thus preventing peace and stability .
fundament@@ alist radic@@ als cannot provide real solutions to the region ’ s basic problems .
the social changes now underway threaten their way of life , which includes discrimination against women and a ban on modern education .
but only profound reforms of traditional authority can pa@@ ve the way towards freedom and growth .
isra@@ el can serve as an example to others stri@@ ving to reach economic prosperity and social freedom , because its success is due to the fact that the country had absolutely nothing at the start .
we returned to our hom@@ eland , rich with history , but de@@ void of natural resources .
isra@@ el was left with only one resource : its human capital .
so we invested in education and science , and today we have the world ’ s highest percentage of scientists and patents per capita .
roughly 95 % of our agriculture is hi@@ -@@ tech .
we use less water and yield more crops per ac@@ re than any other country in the world .
what isra@@ el can do , others can do as well .
we will gla@@ dly offer a helping hand to wh@@ o@@ ever is willing to reach for it .
together , in peace with our neigh@@ b@@ ors , we can create a region of hope , development , and success .
in particular , we must do everything in our power to end the conflict with the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans .
isra@@ el was not born , and it is not isra@@ el ’ s dest@@ iny , to go@@ vern another people .
we are sincerely interested in the establishment of a pal@@ est@@ inian state living peac@@ efully si@@ de-@@ by-@@ side with isra@@ el , the democratic state of the je@@ wish people .
for us , peace is both a moral imperative and a nation@@ al-@@ security strategy , because resolving the conflict would help to stabili@@ ze the region by neutr@@ alizing the extremis@@ ts who seek to manipul@@ ate today ’ s popular movements to advance their radical agenda .
the international community can support these efforts by providing incentives to countries that choose freedom and progress .
at the same time , determined and decisive policies must be taken against extremis@@ ts .
in particular , ir@@ an is a fo@@ unt of moral corruption that sp@@ ear@@ heads extremis@@ m and halts reform , cr@@ ush@@ ing the legitimate protest of its own citizens and acting against the bra@@ ve sy@@ ri@@ ans now fighting for their freedom .
ir@@ an also uses pro@@ x@@ ies to in@@ sti@@ gate terror against moderate forces in the pal@@ est@@ inian authority , le@@ ban@@ on , and i@@ ra@@ q .
if ir@@ an is successful in its plan to acquire nuclear weapons , its leaders could sha@@ ke the middle east and encourage more extremis@@ m and violence .
isra@@ el will defend itself if ir@@ an continues to call for its destruction .
however , the threat is not to isra@@ el alone ; ir@@ an is a danger to the peace and stability of the entire world .
the world ’ s democracies have declared that they will not allow ir@@ an to possess nuclear arms ; it is their duty to follow through on that commitment , before doing so becomes impossible .
beyond the short-term challenges ahead , we all have a duty to pro@@ found@@ ly change the way we prepare our children to cope with today ’ s new world .
in an era where yesterday has become almost ir@@ relevant and we can hardly pre@@ dict tomorrow , the role of education must allow all children to reach their highest potential .
today ’ s educ@@ ators should in@@ sp@@ ire our children towards creativity and innovation .
self-@@ expression is as important as free expression .
i write this in the 88@@ th year of my life , but not because i have learned from experience .
on the contrary , experience is over@@ rated , often constra@@ ining the courage needed to face tomorrow and build an unprecedented new world .
the future is already here ; there is no point in looking back .
against simplification
new y@@ or@@ k – it is said that ameri@@ cans have a geni@@ us for simplification .
gradually , however , the quest for it has become a global trend , one that continues to con@@ quer new territories , just as blue je@@ ans once did .
the speed of our daily life is visi@@ bly increased – and not for the better – by this un@@ stopp@@ able evolution .
the ty@@ ran@@ ny of pragmati@@ s@@ m seems to mark all of the complex di@@ le@@ mm@@ as of our time .
too many valid choices are ignored or sk@@ ir@@ ted through the routine of short-@@ cuts .
no@@ where is this trend more damaging than in today ’ s mer@@ can@@ tile approach to art .
even the mu@@ ch-@@ pra@@ ised notion of competition seems fa@@ ke and cy@@ ni@@ cally manipul@@ ated by the “ corporate ” ment@@ ality that now per@@ v@@ ades the world of culture – by the financial pre-@@ selection that determin@@ es what publ@@ ishers , producers , and other impres@@ arios will support .
just imagine what might have happened with the works of , say , pro@@ ust , k@@ af@@ ka , musi@@ l , f@@ aul@@ k@@ ner , or bor@@ ges had they been subjected to mass@@ -@@ market competition like shoes or cosme@@ tics .
culture is a necessary pause from the daily rat race , from our cha@@ o@@ tic and often vul@@ gar political surroundings , and it is a chance to recover our spiritual energy .
great books , music , and paintings are not only an extraordinary school of beauty , truth , and good , but also a way of dis@@ covering our own beauty , truth , and good – the potential for change , of bet@@ tering ourselves and even some of our inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors .
if this resp@@ ite and refu@@ ge is gradually narro@@ wed and inv@@ aded by the same kind of “ products ” as those that domin@@ ate the mass market , we are condemned to be perpet@@ ual cap@@ tives of the same stun@@ ted universe of “ practic@@ alities , ” the ordinary ag@@ glomer@@ ation of c@@ lich@@ és pack@@ aged in adverti@@ sements .
i was thinking again about these old and seem@@ ingly un@@ sol@@ vable questions during my re-@@ reading of a quite challenging novel by a close friend and a great writer , not very present in the vi@@ vi@@ d landscape of ameri@@ can letters of today .
the theme , style , and echo of his work says a lot , i think , about our simplified world .
the novel is blin@@ ding , by c@@ lau@@ dio ma@@ gr@@ is .
ha@@ iled in europ@@ e as one of the great no@@ vels of the twen@@ tieth century , blin@@ ding arrived in ameri@@ ca only after a great delay , and never received the attention that it deser@@ ved .
unfortunately , that is no surprise .
the number of liter@@ ary translations done nowadays in the united states is , according to a united nations report , equal to that of gre@@ ece , a country one-@@ tent@@ h the size .
imported books are thought to be too “ complicated , ” which is another way of saying that literature should deal with simple issues in a simple way , o@@ be@@ ying the rules of the mass market , with its tri@@ cks of packaging , accessibility , adverti@@ sement , and comfort .
at the core of ma@@ gr@@ is ’ book is the dest@@ iny of a group of itali@@ an commun@@ ists who travel to y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via after the second world war to contribute to the construction of a socialist society , only to be caught in the conflict between stal@@ in and ti@@ to .
they are im@@ pris@@ oned for their stal@@ in@@ ist alle@@ gi@@ ance ; when they are finally allowed to return to ital@@ y , their old com@@ ra@@ des refuse to accept them .
the book ’ s plot sp@@ ans two centuries of revolution .
then , suddenly ,
“ the party van@@ ished , overnight , as if all of a sudden a giant spon@@ ge had dra@@ ined the entire sea , ad@@ ri@@ atic and au@@ str@@ al , leaving lit@@ ter and clo@@ ts of mu@@ d , and all the boats str@@ anded .
how can you go home again if the sea has been su@@ cked down a vast dra@@ in that opened up bene@@ ath it , emp@@ t@@ ying it who knows where , into a void ?
the earth is ari@@ d and dead , but there won ’ t be another one , nor another hea@@ ven . ”
the sol@@ itu@@ de of the individual facing his faith alone , without collective illu@@ sions , and forced to do something with himself in the ari@@ d , noisy world tells us something important about the ex@@ iled world of modern@@ ity and its complex and contradic@@ tory problems .
ma@@ gr@@ is ’ s novel is not only an important liter@@ ary achievement ; it also has a deep connection to the dangers that we face now , particularly the wave of fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , from m@@ um@@ bai to os@@ lo , in the name of a hol@@ y war against the “ other . ”
are all the extremis@@ ts searching for a new coherence , for a lost illu@@ sion of to@@ ge@@ th@@ ern@@ ess and a new hope of res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion ?
can we ever forget se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 11 , 2001 , the start of a bloo@@ dy century in which the my@@ sti@@ cal force of hat@@ red and destruction has recovered its strength ?
are o@@ sam@@ a bin laden ’ s mini@@ ons , the bloo@@ dy ham@@ as-@@ he@@ z@@ bollah bat@@ tali@@ ons , or troub@@ led lon@@ ers like ti@@ mo@@ thy m@@ c@@ v@@ ei@@ gh , the@@ od@@ ore k@@ ac@@ z@@ yn@@ ski , and now nor@@ way ’ s anders be@@ hr@@ ing b@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , the “ her@@ oes ” of our contemporary night@@ mare ?
is this the “ re@@ bel ” response to an over@@ ly glob@@ alized , in@@ coherent , and ultimately distur@@ bing reality ?
if so , their bar@@ bar@@ ism demands scrutiny – in relation to both historical prece@@ dent and to our modern@@ ity – rather than merely being lab@@ eled “ mon@@ stro@@ us ” ( though it certainly is that ) .
the new religious milit@@ ants , fighting in the name of their particular and pec@@ uli@@ ar go@@ d , seem as fan@@ ati@@ ci@@ zed as the fasc@@ ists , n@@ az@@ is , and commun@@ ists of earlier decades .

a gas@@ p from europ@@ e
f@@ ren@@ ch president j@@ acqu@@ es chi@@ rac has al@@ armed the eu candidate countries of central and eastern europ@@ e .
the f@@ ren@@ ch president has accused them of being &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; chil@@ dish &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ir@@ responsible &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; in voic@@ ing their pro-@@ us stance on the i@@ ra@@ q issue , and warned that their position could be &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dangerous , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; as the decision to let them into the eu has not yet been ratified .
quite a sal@@ vo .
then the f@@ ren@@ ch president assumed the role of kin@@ der@@ garten instruc@@ tor vis-à-vis what he called &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; badly brought up &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; candidate countries , telling them that they were &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; ill-@@ beha@@ ved &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and that &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; they missed a great opportunity to shut up . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
to anyone who re@@ members that 40 years ago president char@@ les de gau@@ lle s@@ lam@@ med europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s door shut in the face of b@@ rit@@ ain &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s request to join the europ@@ ean commun@@ ity-@@ -@@ the general thought the bri@@ tish too tied to the us to enter the europ@@ ean family-@@ -@@ these remarks are worrying .
but put things in perspective : j@@ acqu@@ es chi@@ rac is not char@@ les de gau@@ lle ; and europ@@ e has moved far beyond the time when its agenda was unilater@@ ally written by fran@@ ce .
president chi@@ rac &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s self-@@ appointed role as an expert in diplomatic good behavior cannot be taken seriously , even by those of us who know ( and love ) fran@@ ce .
instead , his out@@ bur@@ st is best explained as a sign of frustr@@ ation over the fact that f@@ ren@@ ch influence in the eu is being di@@ l@@ uted .
like king le@@ ar after he lost his king@@ dom , there is nothing fran@@ ce can do about its lost influence but rage im@@ pot@@ ently .
but this dispute within europ@@ e goes deeper than the matter of fran@@ ce &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s lap@@ sed prim@@ acy .
i have always been skep@@ tical about the rhetoric of a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; common &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; foreign policy for the eu .
how can you possibly expect a country such as , say , fran@@ ce to accept being voted down by its eu partners on vital foreign and security policy issues ?
at best , europ@@ e should hope for a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; more common &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; foreign and security policy , even though this fails to answer hen@@ ry k@@ is@@ singer &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s old question : if you want to speak to &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; europ@@ e , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; whom do you call ?
i have long worked to secure a &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; much more common &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; foreign policy within the eu .
therefore i am worried by today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s split within the eu as well as between some member countries and the us over i@@ ra@@ q .
when eight europ@@ ean leaders published their appeal to he@@ al the growing transatlantic ri@@ ft , they were accused of undermining europ@@ ean unity .
nothing could be more incorrect .
they were only ex@@ posing the lack of unity that already existed .
it all began last autumn when german chan@@ cell@@ or ger@@ hard sch@@ rö@@ der , desper@@ ate to hold on to power , made i@@ ra@@ q an issue in the german election campaign .
he played on ger@@ many &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s well-known and respec@@ table p@@ aci@@ f@@ ist feelings .
but by declar@@ ing that he would not , under any circum@@ stance , participate in military actions against i@@ ra@@ q , he under@@ mined the efforts at the un to put maximum pressure behind the demands that i@@ ra@@ q dis@@ arm .
then fran@@ ce embra@@ ced ger@@ many .
f@@ ren@@ ch ways in foreign policy are often mur@@ ky and difficult to deci@@ ph@@ er , unless it is crystal clear where fran@@ ce regards its interests to lie .
usually fran@@ ce li@@ kes to keep its options open .
but when the f@@ ren@@ ch and german governments celebrated the for@@ tieth anniversary of the el@@ ys@@ ée treaty last month , fran@@ ce seemed to paint herself into a corner by supporting the german view .
all this was done without consultations between the f@@ ren@@ ch and german governments and their partners within the eu .
it was a demonstration of the special relationship between fran@@ ce and ger@@ many that has for so many years been the driving force in europ@@ ean integration .
the history of fran@@ co-@@ german reconciliation is impressive indeed .
but it can no longer be taken for granted that other eu countries will automatically ratify the agreements that they reach between themselves as the lo@@ dest@@ ar for common policies .
this is particularly true when their objective is to establish an &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; alternative &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; to ameri@@ can leadership in security policy .
enlargement of the eu with a number of central and eastern europ@@ ean countries will strengthen resistance to fran@@ co-@@ german initiatives in this direction .
the letter from the eight europ@@ ean lea@@ der@@ s@@ --@@ and the later statement from the &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; vil@@ ni@@ us ten &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; group of central and eastern europ@@ ean coun@@ tri@@ es@@ --@@ demonstrated that fran@@ ce ( and ger@@ many ) cannot dict@@ ate a europ@@ ean agenda that creates transatlantic ri@@ fts .
this has obviously caused frustr@@ ations .
the split within the eu and nat@@ o has increased the risk of armed conflict with i@@ ra@@ q because the pressure on i@@ ra@@ q to comply with the un resolutions was weak@@ ened .
chi@@ rac and sch@@ rö@@ der do not seem to gras@@ p this .
so this has not been one of europ@@ e &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s finest hours , especially not while the eu &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s institutional convention is discussing a text that calls for eu governments to &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; actively and un@@ reserv@@ edly support the union &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s common foreign policy . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the german ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m for the eu &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; common foreign and security policy &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; is gas@@ p .
that seems an entirely appropriate expression for what we have been witness@@ ing .
ga@@ za – this was supposed to be my first year of medical school . instead , i am stu@@ ck here in ga@@ za , in my father ’ s house inside the j@@ ab@@ alia refugee camp , with few options and no way out .
after i finished high school last year , i decided to become a doctor .
ga@@ za cri@@ es out for bone specialists , but the training i need is available only abroad .
when i won a place at a medical college in ger@@ many , my parents were proud .
i was exc@@ ited to follow my older brother , who is already studying there .
in f@@ ebru@@ ary , the german authorities granted me an entrance visa .
i wa@@ sted no time in asking the isra@@ eli authorities for permission to travel to europ@@ e .
but i was told that only patients in need of emergency medical ev@@ ac@@ uation would be allowed out – not students .
hundreds of other young people tra@@ pped in the ga@@ za strip have won admission to study abroad .
for many of us , this is our only opportunity to continue our education .
ga@@ za is one of the most den@@ sely populated places on earth , and one of the poorest – 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-@@ 12 kilometers wide .
the local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures , like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery .
universities in ga@@ za are over@@ crow@@ ded and star@@ ved for supplies .
many subjects are not even taught , and there are few post-@@ gradu@@ ate programs .
without the ability to go overseas , we cannot learn .
in jun@@ e , after the united states pres@@ su@@ red isra@@ el to allow ful@@ bright schol@@ ar@@ ship winners to leave the ga@@ za strip , the isra@@ eli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with “ recognized ” schol@@ ar@@ ships – but not “ hundreds . ”
so hundreds of us are still waiting , most without prestigious schol@@ ar@@ ships to draw the world ’ s attention .
i am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave .
life in ga@@ za has bled away my optim@@ ism .
my father is a teacher and own@@ s a children ’ s clothing shop .
my mother is a hou@@ se@@ keep@@ er .
i have six bro@@ thers and three s@@ isters .
we returned to pal@@ est@@ ine in 1996 from sau@@ di arab@@ ia , where my father had been working as a teacher .
that was at the height of the peace process .
my parents put their hope in the os@@ lo acc@@ ords signed in 1993 , and decided that they could give us a better life here .
but when i was ten , the second in@@ ti@@ f@@ ada began .
the peace process was collap@@ sing throughout my te@@ en@@ age years .
during my third year of high school , the isra@@ eli authorities closed off the ga@@ za strip .
isra@@ eli border controls have reduced the flow of people crossing the border to a tri@@ ck@@ le , and have suff@@ oc@@ ated ga@@ za ’ s economy , cho@@ king off imports and exports and cutting fuel deliveries and electricity .
there is no clothing left in my father ’ s shop , which was supposed to support my brother and me during our studies .
with the backing of the us , can@@ ada , and the europ@@ ean union , isra@@ el has maintained its block@@ ade in an attempt to defeat ham@@ as , which won the elections here in 2006 .
but the block@@ ade only makes people more desper@@ ate .
ham@@ as and other armed groups , i know , have launched ro@@ cket attacks from the ga@@ za strip that have killed civilians in isra@@ eli towns and villages .
but i also have witnessed how isra@@ el has re@@ tali@@ ated with air strikes and armed inc@@ ur@@ sions into the ga@@ za strip , including j@@ ab@@ alia .
isra@@ el ’ s block@@ ade amounts to collective punishment .
it is hur@@ ting all of us , whether we support ham@@ as or not .
it is also destroying my dream to write “ specialist in bone medicine ” after my name .
sometimes , i am sorry that i am from ga@@ za .
but my hope is still to go abroad , learn skills , and return to help others here .
sometimes , when there is electricity , i watch television and see how people live in other places .
i ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel , to study , to take vac@@ ations , when i cannot go abroad even to learn medicine .
we are students , not soldiers .
we are not figh@@ ters in this conflict .
why doesn ’ t isra@@ el let us go study ?
why do europ@@ e and ameri@@ ca support a block@@ ade of young minds ?
soon , my fellow class@@ m@@ ates at the medical college will be starting classes .
when they do , i will probably still be here in my father ’ s house , waiting for the block@@ ade to end .
new haven – with charges flying back and forth between the united states and ch@@ ina ahead of the e@@ ag@@ erly awa@@ ited dec@@ ember 1 meeting between president don@@ ald tru@@ mp and president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping at the upcoming g@@ 20 meeting in bu@@ en@@ os ai@@ res , resolving the conflict has taken on great urgency .
the alternatives pose grave risks for both countries : an ever-@@ escal@@ ating trade war , a cold war , or even a hot war .
these risks can be avoided , but only if both leaders are willing to engage in prin@@ cipl@@ ed compromise .
there is no question that a serious conflict has been building for a long time .
contrary to the us nar@@ r@@ ative , the problem is not the out@@ size bilateral trade deficit between the world ’ s two largest economies .
that is largely an out@@ growth of macroeconomic imbalances that aff@@ lic@@ t both sides : ch@@ ina sa@@ ves too much and the us sa@@ ves too little .
these saving disparities give rise to multilateral trade imbalances that cannot be resolved by bilateral efforts .
the us had merch@@ and@@ ise trade deficits with 102 countries in 2017 , whereas ch@@ ina had trade sur@@ pl@@ uses with 16@@ 9 countries in 2016 .
squ@@ ee@@ ze one part of the multilateral im@@ balance for a deficit country or a surplus sa@@ ver , and it simply gets allocated to other trading partners .
for the us , this would lead to hig@@ her@@ -@@ cost imports – the functional equivalent of a tax hi@@ ke on consumers .
for ch@@ ina , it would spell increased export penet@@ ration into other markets .
fix@@ ation on the blame game of bilateral trade imbalances over@@ looks the possibility that this is a classic struggle of co@@ dependen@@ cy .
yes , ch@@ ina has long re@@ lied on the us as the major source of external demand for its ex@@ port-@@ led economy .
but the us needs low-@@ cost imports from ch@@ ina to make ends meet for its in@@ com@@ e-@@ constra@@ ined consumers ; it also re@@ lies on ch@@ ina as the largest foreign buyer of us treas@@ uries to help fund chronic government budget deficits .
and , as ameri@@ ca ’ s third largest and most rapidly growing export market , ch@@ ina has become an increasingly important source of demand for us firms .
the co@@ dependen@@ cy framework is important because it under@@ sco@@ res the need for joint resolution and compromise .
as in inter@@ personal relationships , economic co@@ dependen@@ cy can be dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing and ultimately destruc@@ tive .
when one partner changes course , the other , feeling sc@@ or@@ ned , las@@ hes out in response .
ch@@ ina , in this case , is the change agent – shi@@ fting its growth model from manufacturing to services , from exports to internal consumption , and from imported technology to indigenous innovation .
at the same time , ch@@ ina is also moving from surplus saving to saving absor@@ ption , leaving it less to lend to its deficit partner , the us .
un@@ comfortable in its own skin , the us feels threatened by a partner that is changing the rules of this relationship .
while tru@@ mp has acted on those threats far more aggres@@ sively than his predec@@ essors , there can be no mis@@ taking the bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an us sen@@ timent now align@@ ed against ch@@ ina .
according to a se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 201@@ 8 a@@ xi@@ os survey , fully 80 % of re@@ public@@ ans – long the party most suppor@@ tive of free trade – believed that increased tariffs would be good for the us .
leading re@@ public@@ ans , such as vice president mi@@ ke p@@ ence and former treas@@ ury secret@@ ary hen@@ ry p@@ aul@@ son , have warned of a new cold war with ch@@ ina , while leading democ@@ rats have come to the view that ch@@ ina has ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated its role as a responsible global stakehol@@ der .
at a time of ever-@@ escal@@ ating threats and counter-@@ threats , the imperative of compromise cannot be under@@ stated .
the upcoming meeting between tru@@ mp and x@@ i provides an opportunity to re@@ frame the conflict as a strategic challenge for the world ’ s two leading economies .
four possible a@@ venues to consider :
market access : after ten years of tor@@ tu@@ ous negotiations , the time for a break@@ through on a us-@@ ch@@ ina bilateral investment treaty ( bit ) is at hand .
both sides would need to offer concessions .
a bit would lift ownership caps on foreign direct investment by multinational corporations in both countries , eliminating the conten@@ tious join@@ t-@@ venture structure in ch@@ ina that the us continues to insist – incorrec@@ tly , in my view – has become a mechanism for forced technology transfer .
a bit would also enable an expansion of chin@@ ese ownership of us-@@ dom@@ ic@@ iled assets – posing a challenge to the anti-@@ ch@@ ina thr@@ ust of recent legislation that bro@@ a@@ dens the over@@ sight powers of the committee on foreign investment in the united states .
saving : both countries need to commit to responsible macroeconomic adjustments .
the us needs to save more , revers@@ ing the reck@@ less bud@@ ge@@ t-@@ bu@@ sting tra@@ jec@@ tory reinforced by last year ’ s ill-@@ tim@@ ed , out@@ size tax cuts .
re@@ building saving , rather than tariffs , is the most effective strategy to reduce trade deficits with ch@@ ina or any other trading partner .
at the same time , ch@@ ina needs to save less , putting its vast pool of capital to work funding the country ’ s social safety net , which is essential for consu@@ mer@@ -@@ led economic re@@ balancing .
cy@@ ber security : the digital real@@ m is the batt@@ le@@ ground of the information age , and the se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 2015 acc@@ ord between president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama and x@@ i clearly did not go far enough in def@@ using persistent tensions over online es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , h@@ acking , and dis@@ ruption .
the two countries should take the lead in for@@ ging a global cy@@ ber acc@@ ord , complete with po@@ ol@@ ed met@@ rics of cy@@ ber inc@@ ur@@ sions , att@@ ack@@ -@@ reduction targets and a robust dis@@ pu@@ te-@@ resolution mechanism .
dialogue : it is terri@@ fic that the two presiden@@ ts are meeting again after their earlier t@@ ê@@ te-@@ à-@@ t@@ ê@@ tes in bei@@ jing and at mar@@ -@@ a-@@ la@@ go .
those gather@@ ings follow more formal eng@@ agements such as the strategic and economic dialogue .
but all of these efforts have been episo@@ dic events that are long on gl@@ itz and short on substance .
a permanent secret@@ ariat that would engage in full-@@ time collabor@@ ative efforts on key policy issues ( including data sharing , joint research , and public-@@ private consultation ) would be far more productive .
in light of conten@@ tious recent developments between the us and ch@@ ina , it is hard to be optimistic that a meaningful break@@ through is at hand .
an agenda of substance should be used as a chec@@ kl@@ ist against any acc@@ ord that may be struck by tru@@ mp and x@@ i .
the world is watching .
a gender divided
ox@@ ford – the top and the bottom of the list of countries in news@@ week ’ s recent cover story , “ the 2011 global women ’ s progress report , ” e@@ vo@@ ke images of two different worlds .
at the top of the list – the “ best places to be a woman ” – we see the usual suspec@@ ts : ic@@ eland and the sc@@ andin@@ avian countries , the ne@@ ther@@ lands , swit@@ zer@@ land , and can@@ ada .
on that planet , we see rank@@ ings in the upper 90 ’ s for the survey ’ s five categories : justice , health , education , economics , and politics .
women are out-@@ ear@@ ning men in college degrees ( united states ) , domestic ab@@ users are being banned from their homes and tra@@ cked with electronic monit@@ ors ( tur@@ key ) , and female prime ministers are being elected ( den@@ mark and au@@ str@@ alia ) .
now look at the other planet , “ the worst places in the world to be a woman . ”
in ch@@ ad , the worst of the worst , woman have “ almost no legal rights , ” and girls as young as ten are legally married off , which is also true in ni@@ ger , the sevent@@ h worst place for a woman .
most women in mal@@ i – the fifth worst – have been trau@@ mati@@ zed by female gen@@ ital mu@@ tilation .
in democratic re@@ public of con@@ go , 1,@@ 100 women are rap@@ ed every day .
in y@@ emen , you are free to beat your wife whenever you like .
though it is stunning to see these two worlds in such stark and detailed relief , their existence is not news : development specialists and human rights groups have been calling attention to these in@@ equi@@ ties for years .
but the system@@ ic op@@ pression of women tends to be cast in terms of claims for em@@ pa@@ thy : we sh@@ ouldn ’ t follow these policies because they are not nice , not en@@ ligh@@ tened .
some development researchers have started to make a comp@@ elling case , too , that op@@ pression of women impe@@ des countries ’ efforts to escape poverty .
but the data in the news@@ week list show that we need to frame this issue in stronger , more swe@@ eping terms : when poor countries choose to op@@ press their own women , they are to some extent choosing their own continued poverty .
female op@@ pression is a moral issue ; but it also must be seen as a choice that countries make for short-term “ cultural ” comfort , at the expense of long-term economic and social progress .
it is not politically correct to attri@@ bute any share of very poor countries ’ suffering to their own decisions .
but it is con@@ des@@ c@@ ending to refuse to hold many of them partly responsible for their own p@@ light .
obviously , the legacy of col@@ oni@@ alism – widespread hunger , ill@@ iter@@ acy , lack of property or legal recourse , and vulnerability to state violence – is a major factor in their current poverty .
but how can we blame that legacy while turning a blind eye to a kind of col@@ oni@@ alism against women in these same countries ’ private homes and public institutions ?
when the poorest countries – most of them in afri@@ ca or with mus@@ li@@ m maj@@ orities – choose to sustain and even de@@ vise new policies that op@@ press women , we have to be willing to say that , in some measure , they are choosing the economic mis@@ fortun@@ e that follows .
the developed world ’ s silence suggests that it takes the m@@ ist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of black and bro@@ wn women by black and bro@@ wn men for granted , rather than holding all people to one standard of justice .
the “ sur@@ prises ” on the news@@ week list confirm that educ@@ ating women boo@@ sts economic prosperity .
many countries with hist@@ ories of col@@ oni@@ alism and other forms of ty@@ ran@@ ny , as well as countries without abund@@ ant natural resources , have chosen to educ@@ ate women and grant them legal rights . some continue to struggle economically , but none is ab@@ jec@@ tly poor – and some are bo@@ oming .
think of ch@@ ina , indi@@ a , mal@@ ay@@ sia , in@@ don@@ esia , bra@@ zi@@ l , south korea , and tur@@ key .
the low status of women on planet worst cannot be bl@@ amed on cultural sta@@ sis : many of the “ surprise ” countries – roman@@ ia , portu@@ gal , the p@@ hili@@ pp@@ ines , and indi@@ a – treated women far more un@@ equally a mere 5@@ 0-@@ 100 years ago .
in pak@@ istan , mar@@ ital rap@@ e is not illegal today , and there are 800 honor k@@ ill@@ ings a year .
what kind of economic boom might stag@@ n@@ ating pak@@ istan enjoy if patri@@ arch@@ y relaxed its gri@@ p ?
if you are not inn@@ um@@ er@@ ate , you can start a business .
if you are not living in mor@@ tal fear of rap@@ e and be@@ at@@ ings at home , you can organize your community to dig a new well .
if you are not sub@@ jecting your daughter to trau@@ matic gen@@ ital injury at three and mar@@ rying her off at ten , she can go to school .
and , when she does mar@@ ry and has children of her own , they will benefit from two educated , employed parents , which means twice as much liter@@ ate convers@@ ation in the home , twice the contacts , and twice the encouragement to succeed .
educated , push@@ y mothers make all the difference .
as us secret@@ ary of state h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton put it in the news@@ week issue , “ the world needs to think more strategi@@ cally and cre@@ atively about ta@@ pping into women ’ s potential for growth .
studies show that helping women access trade and grow businesses helps create jobs and boost incomes . ”
but on planet worst , forcing terri@@ fied , un@@ educated women to remain at home is more socially acceptable than facing the fact that this means choosing to drag down incomes for everyone .
it is time to stop ti@@ p@@ to@@ eing around the poorest countries ’ responsibility to do something essential about their own p@@ light : eman@@ cip@@ ate their women .
a german conservative cre@@ do
few concepts are as el@@ astic as that of `@@ `@@ con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m . &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;
at one end of its spectrum of mean@@ ings , con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m has ( over the last two decades ) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civi@@ c life of gre@@ ed and gra@@ b .
at the other end , con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m in many europ@@ ean countries has histor@@ ically ve@@ ered too close for comfort to right-@@ wing extremis@@ m .
in ger@@ many today , con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m was for@@ ged in the wake of the wei@@ mar re@@ public &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s failures , experiences unknown to ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on con@@ servatives .
this history accounts for the type of con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m practic@@ ed by the ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an-@@ democratic union ( c@@ du ) and ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an-@@ social union ( c@@ su ) , who focus on moder@@ ation and balance , preservation and innovation , and on comm@@ anding ger@@ many &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s political center .
with federal elections due in ger@@ many this autumn , much will be said about the nature of german con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m .
some , looking at c@@ du / c@@ su candidate for chan@@ cell@@ or ed@@ mund sto@@ i@@ ber &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s emphasis on b@@ av@@ aria &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s economic success , will seek to portra@@ y the coalition as sha@@ ded danger@@ ously by the `@@ `@@ anything goes &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; market con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m practic@@ ed in ameri@@ ca .
others , pointing to the german con@@ servatives &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; emphasis on social values , will say that we are as st@@ ati@@ st as the social democ@@ rats .
the truth itself is far more complex than these fac@@ ile compar@@ isons , which also makes it more dur@@ able .
c@@ du / c@@ su policies are , of course , founded on the idea of individual freedom , but we believe in an individu@@ alism tem@@ pered by western culture and the ch@@ ris@@ tian tradition .
we are skep@@ tical about un@@ fet@@ tered individu@@ alism because of our awareness of man &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s sin@@ s , but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and ab@@ err@@ ations in ger@@ many &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s 20th century history .
yet , despite this deeply ing@@ ra@@ ined skep@@ tic@@ ism about human nature , we embra@@ ce humanity &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s talent for progress and innovation , because we recognize man &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ability to correct mistakes and errors .
these two tra@@ its , although they seem to conflict , and are certainly different from the values of ameri@@ can and bri@@ tish con@@ servatives , nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmati@@ s@@ m and the sh@@ un@@ ning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that ger@@ many now requires .
far from being willing to co@@ erce people to live in a certain way , german con@@ servatives seek a politics that recogni@@ zes limits - the limits of the state , the market , and the individual .
we conc@@ eive of politics as a mechanism to re@@ conci@@ le en@@ during conflicts , such as those that exist between freedom and security . each , indeed , is un@@ sustainable without the other .
security is us@@ eless without freedom , but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security .
the social market economy , which we continue to embra@@ ce , is based on these principles .
the market is merely a tool , not an answer to every human problem .
it is in recognition of this fact that german con@@ servatives strive , for example , to strike a balance between economy and ec@@ ology . we feel responsible , on a global level , for the environment , which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world .
for globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity . as we open ourselves to the wind &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s of globalization , we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity , such as the family , local and regional communities , religious communities , and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglec@@ ted in recent years .
this is of particular importance for our ideas about the europ@@ ean union , where we seek an effective balance between the nation and europ@@ e .
for german con@@ servatives , europ@@ ean integration and national identity are not war@@ ring concepts , as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others .
they are , instead , two sides of the same coin . the eu was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation .
decades later , the europ@@ ean union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constitu@@ ent nations , as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations , because a common europ@@ ean identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a un@@ it@@ ary constitutional structure .
in essence , the form of government we seek within ger@@ many and across europ@@ e is built on a sense of moral dis@@ course and moral decision-making rather than on the sup@@ pose@@ dly e@@ ternal truth of some abstra@@ ct political concept .
indeed , only an ongoing skep@@ tic@@ ism of fashi@@ onable political no@@ stru@@ ms - both of the st@@ ati@@ st and market fundament@@ alist variety - can promote plur@@ alism and tolerance , and avoid a bal@@ lo@@ oning of the bureaucracy that en@@ fe@@ eb@@ les our economy .
in a fast changing world , this skep@@ tic@@ ism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike .
our political approach embra@@ ces this humane and realistic pragmati@@ s@@ m , for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extrem@@ ist eu@@ ph@@ oria or a fear of the future .
a german europ@@ e ?
l@@ is@@ bon / rig@@ a – is the europ@@ e that is emerging from the euro crisis a german one ?
during the euro crisis , power in the europ@@ ean union seems to have shi@@ fted towards national capit@@ als in general , and towards one national capital in particular : ber@@ lin .
but , with ger@@ many intro@@ ver@@ ted , fran@@ ce down@@ gra@@ ded , and b@@ rit@@ ain semi-@@ deta@@ ched , the big story in europ@@ ean foreign policy is that the time has come for the little guy who thinks big .
in this europ@@ e , the important moves are now sometimes made in stock@@ hol@@ m or war@@ saw , not only in ber@@ lin , par@@ is , or lon@@ don .
and , with major foreign@@ -@@ policy issues on europ@@ e ’ s door@@ step – whether in eg@@ yp@@ t , bel@@ ar@@ us , or now sy@@ ria – useful europ@@ ean initiatives are to be welcomed , regardless of where they origin@@ ate .
ger@@ many , in foreign policy as well as in economics , can ex@@ ert decisive leadership in the eu – when it wants to .
for example , together with pol@@ and , it led the eu ’ s attempt to develop a coordinated approach to rus@@ sia , and it fle@@ xed its mus@@ cles on ser@@ bia .
but , on other issues – for example , li@@ b@@ ya – ger@@ many did not so much lead as use its new@@ found room for man@@ eu@@ ver to follow its own preferences in the face of other eu members .
so the answer today to hen@@ ry k@@ is@@ singer ’ s famous question about whom he should call when he wants to speak to europ@@ e , is not necessarily “ the german chan@@ cell@@ or . ”
while ber@@ lin is increasingly imposing its economic preferences on others in the eurozone , it is not prepared to use military force as a foreign@@ -@@ policy tool , as it demonstrated in the case of li@@ b@@ ya .
moreover , ger@@ many , it seems , is becoming a “ ge@@ o-@@ economic power ” driven by the needs of its export sector .
by using economic means to pursue its foreign@@ -@@ policy ends , ger@@ many is gradually turning its back on its europ@@ ean partners .
mean@@ while , as fran@@ ce experiences a loss of power relative to ger@@ many on economic issues , it continues to play a decisive role in foreign policy .
fran@@ ce led the li@@ b@@ ya operation , and is doing much the same with attempts to impose stronger sanctions against ir@@ an and provide support for the united nations in c@@ ô@@ te d ’ i@@ vo@@ ire .
but fran@@ ce ’ s unilateral approach often ant@@ agon@@ iz@@ es its europ@@ ean partners .
for example , f@@ ren@@ ch president ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy pre@@ emp@@ ted a common europ@@ ean position on the pal@@ est@@ inian stat@@ eh@@ ood bid at the un in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber .
in other words , even when fran@@ ce leads , it does not always do so in a constructive way .
apart from the decisive role that it played in li@@ b@@ ya alongside fran@@ ce , b@@ rit@@ ain is becoming increasingly margin@@ al in europ@@ ean foreign policy@@ making .
even before it vet@@ o@@ ed a plan by eurozone countries to create a “ fiscal union ” at the europ@@ ean summit in dec@@ ember 2011 , it was playing less of a leadership role than it traditionally has on key europ@@ ean foreign@@ -@@ policy issues .
b@@ rit@@ ain has continued to support eu enlargement , closer links with tur@@ key , and development in afri@@ ca , but it has not launched any creative initiatives to bring other member states along or change the terms of the eu debate .
on other issues , such as engaging “ strategic partners ” – ch@@ ina and rus@@ sia in particular – the united king@@ dom is often a fol@@ lower as well .
as the “ big three ” increasingly pursue their own narro@@ w@@ ly defined national interests , however , other eu member states are emerging as leaders in key foreign@@ -@@ policy fields .
for example , s@@ weden – the 14th largest member state in terms of population , and eigh@@ th in terms of g@@ d@@ p – under the leadership of prime minister fre@@ dri@@ k rein@@ fel@@ dt and foreign minister car@@ l bil@@ dt pun@@ ches considerably above its weight .
last year , it increased annual aid to north afri@@ ca by sek@@ 100 million ( € 11.@@ 1 million ) , proposed an eu mission to tun@@ isi@@ a just a week after the revolution to support democratic aspirations there , and was an early and strong back@@ er of un resolutions in support of the u@@ pr@@ ising in li@@ b@@ ya .
pol@@ and , too , is emerging as a foreign@@ -@@ policy leader .
prime minister don@@ ald t@@ us@@ k and foreign minister ra@@ de@@ k si@@ kor@@ ski have particularly taken the initiative on the eu ’ s strategy towards rus@@ sia , where pol@@ and has largely overcome its differences with ger@@ many and is now at the fore@@ front of efforts to develop a genuinely comprehensive approach .
pol@@ and has also led on europ@@ ean defense ( though it declined to take part in the military intervention in li@@ b@@ ya ) .
this reflects the strength of the pol@@ ish economy , which is expected to grow by more than 3 % in 2012 – faster than almost anywhere else in the eu .
ger@@ many might be getting all of the attention in this time of crisis , but the last year has been a remin@@ der that europ@@ e is most effective and influ@@ ential when the small countries get involved and join forces with – and even lead – the big ones .
for example , on ir@@ an ( with exceptions like gre@@ ece ) , europ@@ e@@ ans have united around a clear policy and collective positions , such as an oil embargo .
so , pol@@ and and s@@ weden : europ@@ e needs your leadership .
but that might not be enough in an eu with more than 500 million citizens .
other eu states need to follow their example in order to make europ@@ ean foreign policy truly effective and influ@@ ential .
a german g@@ limm@@ er in a global boom
in 2004 , the world economy grew at a rate of 5.@@ 1 % , the fastest pace in the last 28 years .
while i@@ fo@@ `@@ s world economic climate indicator , generated from quar@@ ter@@ ly surveys of 1,@@ 200 experts in 90 countries , wor@@ sen@@ ed slightly during the first three quarters of 2005 , it rose again in the last quarter , indicating a continuation of the boom .
in 2005 , growth is estimated to have been about 4.@@ 3 % , and a similar rate can be expected in 2006 , marking a period of sustained rapid global growth un@@ seen since the 1970 ’ s .
but the boom is not uniform .
in the united states , the number of experts giving a favor@@ able assessment of the current situation declined ; indeed , a majority believes that the economic situation will wor@@ sen during the next six months .
however , in the asi@@ an countries , including ch@@ ina , the optim@@ ism is un@@ broken .
the same is true for eastern europ@@ e , the ex-@@ so@@ vi@@ et states , and l@@ atin ameri@@ ca .
the big surprise is europ@@ e , which , unlike in 2004 and the first half of 2005 , now seems to be cat@@ ching up with the rest of the world .
whereas growth was a mis@@ er@@ able 1.5 % in 2005 in the 15 “ old ” members of the europ@@ ean union , i@@ fo expects eu@@ -@@ 15 growth to accelerate to 2.1 % in 2006 .
to be sure , economic performance will vary widely among eu countries .
while ital@@ y will be the lag@@ g@@ ard , with only 1.1 % growth , the ir@@ ish ro@@ cket will not lose its force , pushing real g@@ d@@ p up by about 4.@@ 8 % .
in general , the big eu countries are still performing badly , in contrast to the smaller members – hardly surprising , given that the eu is basically an institution to help the smaller countries overcome the draw@@ back of their size by extending the ag@@ glomer@@ ation advantages that formerly were reserved to the bigger countries .
but even ger@@ many , europ@@ e ’ s biggest economy , is experiencing an up@@ s@@ wing .
the i@@ fo climate indicator for ger@@ many , based on monthly surveys of 7@@ ,000 firms , jum@@ ped up@@ wards in the second half of 2005 , reaching its highest value since the boom year 2000 , with businesses ’ assessment of the current situation and expectations improving .
after five years of stag@@ nation , the economy is finally on the move .
the driving force is external demand , as ger@@ many , the world ’ s second-@@ largest expor@@ ter , profits from the global boom .
exports increased by 6.@@ 2 % in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.@@ 4 % in 2006 .
however , as we saw in 2004 and 2005 , exports are not enough to create substantial growth if domestic demand does not follow .
the good news for ger@@ many is that investment demand is now growing , too .
while the second half of 2005 was already quite good , i@@ fo expects investment in equipment to grow by a healthy 6 % in 2006 .
after many years of contra@@ ction , investment in construction also will rise slightly .
total investment growth is expected to reach 2.@@ 9 % – weak by past standards , but nonetheless a promising sal@@ ve for the wo@@ unded german mood .
moreover , any investment growth is vital for ger@@ many , which , according to the latest o@@ ec@@ d statistics , currently suff@@ ers from the world ’ s lowest share of net investment in national income .
even if ger@@ many remains the world ’ s lag@@ g@@ ard , rising investment demand as such will contribute to g@@ d@@ p growth , which i@@ fo estimates at 1.@@ 7 % in 2006 .
that number looks small compared to most other countries .
in fact , all eu countries except ital@@ y and the ne@@ ther@@ lands will grow faster .
but everything is relative : ger@@ many ’ s trend growth rate is just 1.1 % , and the country has been the slow@@ est growing eu country since 1995 .
measured against a dis@@ appointing past , even ger@@ many is currently experiencing an economic boom .
indeed , even german unemployment , which has been rising in cycles since 1970 , will decline slightly in 2006 , from 4.@@ 8 to 4.@@ 7 million .
the good economic data will reinforce initial favor@@ able impres@@ sions of angel@@ a merk@@ el ’ s new government , which got off to an excellent start at the eu summit , where merk@@ el helped to bro@@ ker a compromise between b@@ rit@@ ain and fran@@ ce on the union ’ s 2007-2013 budget ( by adding another € 2 billion to ger@@ many ’ s annual contribution ) .
in fact , the government may even have contributed a bit to the good economic data by announ@@ cing a serious effort to consolidate ger@@ many ’ s own public finances – a prerequisite for investor confidence .
according to the government , substantial tax increases will bring the fiscal deficit below the 3 % -@@ of-@@ g@@ d@@ p limit set by the stability and growth pact – a target missed for five consec@@ utive years – by 2007 .
the real test for the german government is the labor market .
most observers now agree that ger@@ many needs something like the ameri@@ can ear@@ ne@@ d-@@ income tax credit .
in ger@@ many , it ’ s called “ activ@@ ating social aid ” or “ comb@@ i wages , ” but the principle is the same : the state should reduce the money it pays for doing nothing and pay more for participating in the work force .
that would wi@@ den the wage distribution , create jobs , and maintain the living standard of the poor .
merk@@ el announced in her inaug@@ ural speech in the bun@@ de@@ stag that her government will introduce such a system in 2006 .
if this is more than lip service , and if she really carries out a serious reform of the german welfare state ’ s incentive structure , the result could be higher employment and structural economic growth .
in the long term , that would be more promising for the eu – and for the global economy – than the dem@@ and-@@ driven performance that ger@@ many is currently enjoying .
is pension@@ er popul@@ ism here to stay ?
mil@@ an – the right-@@ wing popul@@ ism that has emerged in many western democracies in recent years could turn out to be much more than a bli@@ p on the political landscape .
beyond the great recession and the migration crisis , both of which created fer@@ tile ground for popul@@ ist parties , the aging of the west ’ s population will continue to alter political power dynam@@ ics in popul@@ ists ’ favor .
it turns out that older voters are rather sympa@@ thetic to nation@@ alist movements .
older b@@ rit@@ ons voted dis@@ proportion@@ ately in favor of leaving the europ@@ ean union , and older ameri@@ cans delivered the us presidency to don@@ ald tru@@ mp .
neither the law and justice ( p@@ is ) party in pol@@ and nor fi@@ des@@ z in hung@@ ary would be in power without the enthusi@@ astic support of the elderly .
and in ital@@ y , the le@@ ague has succeeded in large part by explo@@ iting the dis@@ content of northern ital@@ y ’ s sen@@ iors .
among today ’ s popul@@ ists , only marine le pen of fran@@ ce ’ s national r@@ ally ( formerly the national front ) – and possibly j@@ air bol@@ son@@ aro in bra@@ zi@@ l – re@@ lies on younger voters .
next spring , this age-@@ driven voting pattern could drive the outcome of the europ@@ ean parliament election .
according to recent studies , older europ@@ e@@ ans – especially those with less education – are more suspici@@ ous of the europ@@ ean project and less tru@@ sting of the europ@@ ean parliament than younger europ@@ e@@ ans are .
this is surprising , given that memories of world war ii and its legacy should be fresh@@ er for older generations .
nevertheless , their skep@@ tic@@ ism toward democratic eu institutions may explain their recep@@ tiveness to author@@ itarian leaders .
most likely , a growing sense of in@@ security is pushing the elderly into the popul@@ ists ’ arms .
leaving aside countr@@ y-@@ specific pec@@ uli@@ arities , nation@@ alist parties all promise to stem global forces that will affect older people dis@@ proportion@@ ately .
for example , immigration tends to in@@ still more fear in older voters , because they are usually more attached to traditional values and self-@@ contained communities .
likewise , globalization and technological progress often dis@@ rupt traditional or legacy industries , where older workers are more likely to be employed .
the rise of the digital economy , dominated by people in their twen@@ ties and thir@@ ties , is also pushing older workers to the margins .
but , unlike in the past , cru@@ m@@ bling pension systems can no longer absor@@ b such lab@@ or-@@ market sho@@ cks .
the result is that older workers who lose their job are condemned to long-term unemployment .
moreover , pension@@ ers now have reason to worry about threats to their retirement benefits from their own children .
young people , frustr@@ ated with soci@@ o@@ economic systems that are clearly til@@ ted in favor of reti@@ re@@ es , are increasingly calling for fairer inter@@ gener@@ ational re@@ distribution of scar@@ ce resources .
for example , ital@@ y ’ s five star movement , which govern@@ s in a coalition with the le@@ ague , recently called for a “ citizen ’ s income ” that would be available to all unemployed people regardless of age .
so , while right-@@ wing popul@@ ists have attracted older voters , le@@ ft-@@ wing popul@@ ist have gained a following among younger generations .
by backing right-@@ wing popul@@ ists , older voters hope to return to a time when domestic affairs were insul@@ ated from global forces and national borders were less por@@ ous .
at the heart of today ’ s nation@@ alist politics is a promise to preserve the status quo – or even to restore a my@@ th@@ ical past .
hence , nation@@ alist politicians often resort to no@@ stal@@ gic rhetoric to mobili@@ ze their older supporters .
for his part , tru@@ mp has ple@@ dged to bring back jobs in the ameri@@ can r@@ ust belt , once the center of us manufacturing .
likewise , there could be no clearer symbol of resistance to change than his proposed wall on the us-@@ m@@ ex@@ ico border .
and his cra@@ ck@@ down on illegal immigration and ban on travel@@ ers from predomin@@ antly mus@@ li@@ m countries signals his commitment to a “ pure ” ameri@@ can nation .
simil@@ arly , in continental europ@@ e , right-@@ wing popul@@ ists want to return to a time before the adoption of the euro and the schen@@ gen system of pas@@ spor@@ t-@@ free travel within most of the eu .
and they often appeal directly to older voters by promising to lower the retirement age and expand pension benefits ( both are flag@@ ship policies of the le@@ ague ) .
in the united king@@ dom , the “ leave ” campaign promised v@@ indication for those who have been left behind in the age of globalization .
never mind that it also tou@@ ted the idea of a free and independent “ global b@@ rit@@ ain . ”
the bre@@ x@@ it@@ e@@ ers are not known for their consistency .
at any rate , to the extent that today ’ s popul@@ ist wave is driven by demo@@ graphics , it is not likely to cre@@ st any@@ time soon .
in gra@@ ying societies , the political cl@@ out of the elderly will steadily grow ; and in rapidly changing economies , their ability to adapt will decline .
as a result , older voters will demand more and more soci@@ o@@ economic security , and ir@@ responsible popul@@ ists will be waiting in the w@@ ings to accommodate them .
to stem the nation@@ alist ti@@ de , main@@ stream parties urgently need to de@@ vise a new social compact that addresses the mounting sense of in@@ security among older voters .
they will need to strike a better balance between openness and protection , innovation and regulation ; and they will need to do so without falling into a reg@@ res@@ sive popul@@ ist tra@@ p .
the answer is not to suff@@ oc@@ ate global forces , but to render them more toler@@ able .
citizens of all ages need to be equipped to face current and future dis@@ rup@@ tions .
in this sense , it is better to em@@ power the elderly than simply to protect them .
most advanced economies simply cannot afford massive new benefits for an over@@ sized interest group .
and besides , a policy that makes people reli@@ ant on some form of external support is mor@@ ally question@@ able , at best .
instead , governments should focus on upgrading older workers ’ skills , creating more opportunities for older and younger generations to work together , and holding dis@@ rup@@ tors accountable for the soci@@ o@@ economic consequences they generate .
subsidies to the most vulnerable should remain a last resort .
in many ways , older voters ’ inf@@ at@@ uation with popul@@ ists is a c@@ ry for help .
it is up to en@@ ligh@@ tened politicians to respond to it construc@@ tively .
a global agenda for seven billion
new y@@ or@@ k – late next month , a child will be born – the 7th billion citizen of planet earth . we will never know the circumstances into which he or she was born .
we do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and un@@ predictable change – environmental , economic , geo@@ political , technological , and demographic .
the world ’ s population has tri@@ pled since the united nations was created in 1945 .
and our numbers keep growing , with corresponding pressures on land , energy , food , and water . the global economy is generating pressures as well : rising job@@ less@@ ness , wi@@ dening social inequalities , and the emergence of new economic powers .
these trends link the fate and future of today ’ s seven billion people as never before . no nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-@@ first century . international cooperation is a universal need .
the 6@@ 6th session of the un general assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow , short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity ’ s long-term imper@@ atives .
at a time when all nations are experiencing individual challenges , we need to for@@ ge a worldwide common agenda that can help to ensure that the seven billi@@ on@@ th baby and future generations grow up in a world characterized by sustainable peace , prosperity , freedom , and justice .
to help create this future , i am focusing my second term as sec@@ retary-@@ general on five global imper@@ atives – five gener@@ ational opportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the decisions we make today .
the first and greatest of these imper@@ atives is sustainable development . we all must understand that saving our planet , lifting people out of poverty , and adv@@ ancing economic growth are one and the same fight . we must connect the do@@ ts between climate change , water scar@@ city , energy short@@ ages , global health , food security , and women ’ s em@@ power@@ ment . solutions to one problem must be solutions for all .
in the next five years , we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and for@@ ge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement .
fostering economic growth , re@@ alizing the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals , and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-@@ first century and extending it to every person on the planet .
prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity .
this year , the un peac@@ eke@@ eping budget will total $ 8 billion . think of what we could save by avoiding conflicts – by deplo@@ ying political mediation missions , for example , rather than troops .
we know how to do this .
our record proves it – in gu@@ ine@@ a , ken@@ ya , and k@@ yr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
a third imperative is building a safer and more secure world . in this effort , we must be cour@@ age@@ ous in standing up for democracy , human rights , and peace .
this year was one of signature achievements in restoring and securing peace – in c@@ ô@@ te d ’ i@@ vo@@ ire , dar@@ fur , eg@@ yp@@ t , and elsewhere . but hat@@ red and bloo@@ d@@ shed still stand in the way of our vision for peace .
in the middle east , we must break the stal@@ em@@ ate .
pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans deserve a state .
isra@@ el needs security .
both want peace . a negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes , and the un is a platform for for@@ ging such a peace .
so , too , will we continue our efforts to foster democratic governance in i@@ ra@@ q , afgh@@ an@@ istan , the democratic re@@ public of con@@ go , and si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one . and , in the name of all of humanity , we will continue to push forward on nuclear dis@@ armament and non-@@ proliferation , in service of re@@ alizing a world free of nuclear weapons .
this year ’ s dramatic events in north afri@@ ca and the middle east inspired people around the globe .
let us help make the ar@@ ab spring a true season of hope for all .
in li@@ b@@ ya , we are deplo@@ ying a new un support mission to assist the country ’ s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order , consistent with the aspirations of the li@@ by@@ an people .
sy@@ ria is a special concern .
for six months we have seen escal@@ ating violence and repression .
the government has repeatedly ple@@ dged to undertake reforms and listen to its people .
it has not done so .
the moment to act is now .
the violence must stop .
last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people .
women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world ’ s un@@ realized potential .
we need their full engagement – in government , business , and civil society .
the un has placed a high priority on promoting women at all levels of the organization and this year , for the first time , un women is operating to promote the interests and rights of women all over the world .
seven billion people now look toward the united nations for solutions to the world ’ s great global challenges .
they hold different religi@@ ons and back@@ grounds but common dreams and aspirations .
let our common agenda begin .
a global consensus against terrorism
mention the united nations and the first reaction is likely to be the ongoing o@@ il-@@ for@@ -@@ food sc@@ andal and what it will mean for sec@@ retary-@@ general ko@@ fi ann@@ an ’ s ability to lead the organization for the remaining year and a half of his ten@@ ure .
but there is much more going on at the un than investigations .
reform is in the air – in part because of the sc@@ andal , but also because of the un ’ s in@@ ability to deal effectively with challenges ranging from r@@ wand@@ a and ko@@ so@@ vo to i@@ ra@@ q and , most recently , su@@ dan .
even the un ’ s most ar@@ dent supporters now recognize that change is called for if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security .
the security council represents what the world war ii allies believed the post-@@ war world would look like and how it should be run .
this helps to explain why a mu@@ ch-@@ weak@@ ened fran@@ ce was made a permanent member of the council – and why ger@@ many and jap@@ an ( and a no@@ t-@@ yet independent indi@@ a ) were not .
defending the security council ’ s current ma@@ ke-@@ up is impossible ; the need for change is beyond debate .
but coming up with an approach that gains broad international support will prove extremely difficult .
great b@@ rit@@ ain and fran@@ ce will resist being replaced by a single eu seat , while making ger@@ many a permanent member would only exacerb@@ ate the problem of europ@@ e ’ s relative over-@@ representation .
pak@@ istan would object to adding indi@@ a to the security council ; ar@@ gent@@ ina , ch@@ ile , and m@@ ex@@ ico to adding bra@@ zi@@ l ; ni@@ geri@@ a to south afri@@ ca ( and vi@@ ce-@@ vers@@ a ) ; and several countries , including ch@@ ina , in@@ don@@ esia , and south korea , might resist creating a permanent seat for jap@@ an .
clearly , fixing the security council will require considerable time and political effort .
in the meantime , there is important work to be done .
one productive a@@ venue would be to follow up on one of the recommendations of the high level panel that was endorsed by ann@@ an ; namely , that all un members go on record declar@@ ing that terrorism has no place in today ’ s world .
this will prove more difficult than it first sounds .
for too long , the international community has toler@@ ated terrorism – the inten@@ tional killing of civilians and non@@ comb@@ at@@ ants by non-@@ state actors for political purposes – on the grounds that , on occasion , “ one man ’ s terrorist is another man ’ s freedom figh@@ ter . ”
hist@@ ori@@ ans have the luxury of debating whether terrorism may have been justified in certain situations in the past .
modern terrorism is too destruc@@ tive to be toler@@ ated , much less supported .
weapons of mass destruction – nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons – are just that , and no cause can excuse their use .
moreover , as the terrorist attacks on ameri@@ ca of 2001 showed , weapons as basic as bo@@ x-@@ cut@@ ters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulner@@ abilities of modern , global life .
terrorism is even less justified given that political a@@ venues exist nowadays for pursuing political aims .
pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans can negotiate their future relationship with isra@@ el and can count on ameri@@ can , rus@@ sian , europ@@ ean , and un assistance .
i@@ ra@@ q@@ is have elected their own representatives and are po@@ ised to write their constitution .
no one pursuing reasonable goals and who is prepared to compromise can argue that terrorism is his or his group ’ s only option .
the world has already taken some important steps against terrorism .
a do@@ zen international conventions and numerous un resolutions commit governments to oppose ho@@ stage taking , the hi@@ j@@ acking of civilian aircraft , and terrorism more broadly .
simil@@ arly , the mandate of the financial action task force , created in 1989 to cur@@ b money laundering , has grown and become focused mainly on cur@@ bing terrorist financing .
un security council resolution 13@@ 73 , passed after the se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 11 attacks , calls on states to deny safe haven to terrorists , bring to justice anyone associated with terrorism , sup@@ press recruitment by terrorist groups , block terrorists ’ efforts to acquire weapons , and cooperate with other governments and international organizations in tracking suspec@@ ts and boosting security .
what is missing is a new , 13th convention that clos@@ es the lo@@ op@@ hole that seems to permit governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not .
broad agreement is needed that any inten@@ tional killing of civilians and non@@ comb@@ at@@ ants is unacceptable , and that its perpet@@ r@@ ators and supporters must be pun@@ ished .
of course , such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism .
but ideas matter .
terrorism needs to be de-@@ legitim@@ ized in the way that sla@@ very has been .
doing so will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism ; it should also make it less difficult to gar@@ ner support for international action against those who nevertheless carry it out .
we are taught early on in our lives that the end cannot justify the means .
it is time to put this principle into effect before many more innocent lives are lost .
a global green new deal
nai@@ rob@@ i – with unemployment so@@ aring , bankrupt@@ cies climbing , and stock markets in free-@@ fall , it may at first gl@@ ance seem sensible to di@@ t@@ ch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold .
but this would be a devastating mistake of immediate , as well as inter-@@ gener@@ ational , propor@@ tions .
far from bur@@ dening an already over-@@ stressed , over-@@ stret@@ ched global economy , environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work , get order books f@@ lowing , and assist in power@@ ing economies back to health .
in the past , concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury ; today , it is a necessity – a point gras@@ ped by some , but by no means all , economic architects yet .
a big sli@@ ce of president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s $ 8@@ 25 billion stimulus package for the united states includes a boost to renewable energy , “ we@@ ath@@ eri@@ zing ” a million homes , and upgrading the country ’ s in@@ efficient electricity grid .
such investments could generate an estimated five million “ gre@@ en-@@ col@@ lar ” jobs , provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries , and get ameri@@ ca back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security .
the re@@ public of korea , which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years , has also spot@@ ted the green lining to gri@@ m economic times .
president le@@ e my@@ ung@@ -@@ ba@@ k ’ s government plans to invest $ 38 billion emplo@@ ying people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building em@@ bank@@ ments and water@@ -@@ treatment facilities .
other elements of le@@ e ’ s plan include construction of eco-@@ friendly transportation networks , such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks , and generating energy using waste me@@ than@@ e from land@@ f@@ ills .
the package also counts on investments in hybri@@ d vehicle technologies .
similar pro-@@ employment “ green new deal ” packages have been lined up in ch@@ ina , jap@@ an , and the united king@@ dom .
they are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs , fighting poverty , and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports .
in south afri@@ ca , the govern@@ ment-@@ backed working for water initiative – which emplo@@ ys more than 30@@ ,000 people , including women , youth , and the disabled – also sees opportunity in crisis .
the country sp@@ ends roughly $ 60 million annually fighting inv@@ a@@ sive alien plants that threaten native wild@@ life , water supplies , important tourism destinations , and farm@@ land .
this work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of inv@@ a@@ sive alien plants are har@@ vest@@ ed for power@@ -@@ station fuel .
as a result , an estimated 500 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electricity , equal to 2 % of the country ’ s electricity needs , will be generated , along with more than 5@@ ,000 jobs .
so it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure , energy systems , and eco@@ systems as among the best bets for recovery .
others may be un@@ sure about the potential returns from investing in eco@@ system services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80 % of afri@@ cans who have no access to electricity .
still others may simply be un@@ aware of how to precisely follow suit .
in early f@@ ebru@@ ary , the united nations environment program will conven@@ e some of the world ’ s leading economists at the un ’ s headquarters in new y@@ or@@ k .
a strategy for a global green new deal , tailored to different national challenges , will be fl@@ esh@@ ed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fron@@ ts .
the global green new deal , which un@@ ep launched as a concept in oc@@ tober 2008 , respon@@ ds to the current economic mal@@ a@@ ise .
spent wis@@ ely , however , these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transform@@ ational trends , setting the stage for a more sustainable , urgently needed green economy for the twenty-@@ first century .
the tril@@ li@@ ons of dollars that have been mobili@@ zed to address current wo@@ es , together with the tril@@ li@@ ons of investors ’ dollars waiting in the w@@ ings , represent an opportunity that was un@@ thin@@ k@@ able only 12 months ago : the chance to ste@@ er a more re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natur@@ al-@@ resource scar@@ city to water short@@ ages and biodiversity loss .
blin@@ dly pum@@ ping the current ba@@ il-@@ out billions into old industries and exhau@@ sted economic models will be thro@@ wing good money after bad while mort@@ g@@ aging our children ’ s future .
instead , political leaders must use these wind@@ falls to invest in innovation , promote sustainable businesses , and encourage new patterns of decent , long-@@ lasting employment .
a global perfect storm
new y@@ or@@ k – dark , lower@@ ing financial and economic cl@@ ou@@ ds are , it seems , rolling in from every direction : the eurozone , the united states , ch@@ ina , and elsewhere .
indeed , the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shel@@ ter .
for star@@ ters , the eurozone crisis is wor@@ sen@@ ing , as the euro remains too strong , fron@@ t-@@ loaded fiscal austerity deep@@ ens recession in many member countries , and a credit c@@ run@@ ch in the peripher@@ y and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery .
the eurozone banking system is becoming bal@@ kan@@ ized , as cross-border and inter@@ bank credit lines are cut off , and capital flight could turn into a full run on peripher@@ y banks if , as is likely , gre@@ ece stages a dis@@ order@@ ly euro exit in the next few months .
moreover , fiscal and sovereign@@ -@@ debt stra@@ ins are becoming worse as interest@@ -@@ rate spre@@ ads for sp@@ ain and ital@@ y have returned to their un@@ sustainable peak levels .
indeed , the eurozone may require not just an international ba@@ il@@ out of banks ( as recently in sp@@ ain ) , but also a full sovereign ba@@ il@@ out at a time when eurozone and international fire@@ walls are insufficient to the task of back@@ st@@ opping both sp@@ ain and ital@@ y .
as a result , dis@@ order@@ ly break@@ up of the eurozone remains possible .
far@@ ther to the west , us economic performance is weak@@ ening , with first-@@ quarter growth a mis@@ erly 1.@@ 9 % – well below potential .
worse , the risk of a double-@@ di@@ p recession next year is rising : even if what looks like a lo@@ oming us fiscal cli@@ ff turns out to be only a smaller source of drag , the likely increase in some taxes and reduction of some transfer payments will reduce growth in dis@@ pos@@ able income and consumption .
moreover , political gri@@ d@@ lock over fiscal adjustment is likely to pers@@ ist , regardless of whether bar@@ ack ob@@ ama or mit@@ t rom@@ ney wins nov@@ ember ’ s presidential election .
in the east , ch@@ ina , its growth model un@@ sustainable , could be under@@ water by 2013 , as its investment b@@ ust continues and reforms intended to boost consumption are too little too late .
a new chin@@ ese leadership must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national savings and increase consumption ’ s share of g@@ d@@ p ; but divisions within the leadership about the pace of reform , together with the li@@ ke@@ lihood of a b@@ ump@@ y political transition , suggest that reform will occur at a pace that simply is not fast enough .
the economic slow@@ down in the us , the eurozone , and ch@@ ina already implies a massive drag on growth in other emerging markets , owing to their trade and financial links with the us and the europ@@ ean union ( that is , no “ dec@@ ou@@ pling ” has occurred ) .
at the same time , the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets , together with their move towards greater state capitalism , is ham@@ per@@ ing growth and will reduce their re@@ sili@@ ency .
finally , long-@@ si@@ mm@@ ering tensions in the middle east between isra@@ el and the us on one side and ir@@ an on the other on the issue of nuclear proliferation could reach a bo@@ il by 2013 .
the current negotiations are likely to fail , and even tigh@@ tened sanctions may not stop ir@@ an from trying to build nuclear weapons .
with the us and isra@@ el un@@ willing to accept con@@ tainment of a nuclear ir@@ an by deter@@ r@@ ence , a military confron@@ tation in 2013 would lead to a massive oil price spi@@ ke and global recession .
these risks are already exacerb@@ ating the economic slow@@ down : equity markets are falling everywhere , leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending .
borro@@ wing costs are rising for highly in@@ deb@@ ted sovereig@@ ns , credit ration@@ ing is undermining small and medium-@@ size companies , and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries ’ income .
increasing risk a@@ version is leading economic agents to adopt a wa@@ it-@@ and-@@ see stance that makes the slow@@ down partly self-@@ fulfilling .
compared to 2008-@@ 2009 , when policymakers had ample space to act , monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of policy bul@@ lets ( or , more cy@@ ni@@ cally , policy ra@@ b@@ bits to pull out of their h@@ ats ) .
monetary policy is constra@@ ined by the proximity to zero interest rates and repeated ro@@ unds of quantitative eas@@ ing .
indeed , economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems , but rather credit and in@@ solvency crises .
mean@@ while , un@@ sustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus .
using exchange rates to boost net exports is a zer@@ o-@@ sum game at a time when private and public dele@@ ver@@ aging is sup@@ pressing domestic demand in countries that are running curr@@ ent-@@ account deficits and structural issues are having the same effect in surplus countries .
after all , a weaker currency and better trade balance in some countries necessarily implies a stronger currency and a weaker trade balance in others .
mean@@ while , the ability to back@@ stop , ring@@ -@@ f@@ ence , and ba@@ il out banks and other financial institutions is constra@@ ined by politics and near@@ -@@ in@@ sol@@ vent sovereig@@ ns ’ in@@ ability to absor@@ b additional losses from their banking systems .
indeed , sovereig@@ ns are dumping a larger fra@@ ction of their public debt onto banks ’ balance sheet , especially in the eurozone .
unfortunately , ger@@ many res@@ ists all of these key policy measures , as it is fix@@ ated on the credit risk to which its taxpayers would be exposed with greater economic , fiscal , and banking integration .
as a result , the prob@@ ability of a eurozone disaster is rising .
and , while the cl@@ oud over the eurozone may be the largest to bur@@ st , it is not the only one threatening the global economy .
b@@ atten down the hat@@ ches .
a global solutions network
new y@@ or@@ k – great social change occurs in several ways .
a technological break@@ through – the steam engine , computers , the internet – may play a leading role .
vision@@ aries , such as ma@@ hat@@ ma g@@ and@@ hi , mar@@ tin lu@@ ther king j@@ r . , and n@@ elson mand@@ ela , may in@@ sp@@ ire a demand for justice .
political leaders may lead a broad reform movement , as with fran@@ kl@@ in roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t and the new deal .
our own generation urgently needs to sp@@ ur another era of great social change .
this time , we must act to save the planet from a hum@@ an-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed environmental catastro@@ phe .
each of us senses this challenge almost daily .
heat waves , d@@ rou@@ ghts , floods , forest fires , re@@ treating gl@@ aci@@ ers , poll@@ uted rivers , and extreme stor@@ ms buffet the planet at a dramatically rising rate , owing to human activities .
our $ 7@@ 0-@@ tril@@ li@@ on-@@ per@@ -@@ year global economy is putting unprecedented pressures on the natural environment .
we will need new technologies , behavi@@ ors , and ethics , supported by solid evidence , to re@@ conci@@ le further economic development with environmental sustainability .
united nations sec@@ retary-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon is taking on this unprecedented challenge from his unique position at the cross@@ roads of global politics and society .
at the political level , the un is the meeting place for 19@@ 3 member states to negotiate and create international law , as in the important treaty on climate change adopted at the ri@@ o earth summit in 1992 .
at the level of global society , the un represents the world ’ s citiz@@ en@@ ry , “ we the peoples , ” as it says in the un charter . at the soci@@ etal level , the un is about the rights and responsibilities of all of us , including future generations .
in the past two decades , governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats .
politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties adopted at the 1992 earth summit .
ban knows that strong government action remains vital , but he also recogni@@ zes that civil society must also play a larger role , especially because too many governments and politicians are be@@ hol@@ den to vest@@ ed interests , and too few politicians think in time horiz@@ ons that extend past the next election .
to em@@ power global society to act , ban has launched a bold new global initiative , for which i am grateful to volunte@@ er .
the idea is to use global networks of knowledge and action to identify and demonstrate new , c@@ utt@@ ing-@@ edge approaches to sustainable development around the world .
the network will work alongside and support governments , un agencies , civil@@ -@@ society organizations , and the private sector .
humanity needs to learn new ways to produce and use low-@@ carbon energy , grow food sustain@@ ably , build li@@ vable cities , and manage the global comm@@ ons of oc@@ e@@ ans , biodiversity , and the atmosphere .
but time is running very short .
today ’ s me@@ ga@@ -@@ cities , for example , already have to confront dangerous heat waves , rising sea levels , more extreme stor@@ ms , di@@ re con@@ gestion , and air and water pollution .
agricultural regions already need to become more re@@ sili@@ ent in the face of increased climate vol@@ atility .
and as one region in one part of the world designs a better way to manage its transport , energy needs , water supplies , or food supplies , those successes should quickly become part of the global knowledge base , enabling other regions to benefit rapidly as well .
universities have a special role to play in the new un knowledge network .
exactly 150 years ago , in 18@@ 62 , ab@@ ra@@ ham lin@@ col@@ n created ameri@@ ca ’ s “ land-@@ grant ” universities to help local communities to improve farming and the quality of life through science .
today , we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies face the challenges of poverty reduction , clean energy , sustainable food supplies , and the rest .
by linking together , and putting their cur@@ ricul@@ a online , the world ’ s universities can become even more effective in dis@@ covering and promoting sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ based solutions to complex problems .
the world ’ s corporate sector also has a significant role to play in sustainable development .
now the corporate sector has two faces .
it is the re@@ pository of c@@ utt@@ ing-@@ edge sustainable technologies , pione@@ ering research and development , world-@@ class management , and leadership in environmental sustainability .
yet at the same time , the corporate sector lob@@ bi@@ es aggres@@ sively to gut environmental regulations , s@@ lash corpor@@ ate-@@ tax rates , and avoid their own responsibility for ecological destruction .
sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide .
we urgently need far-@@ si@@ ghted companies to join the sustainable development solutions network .
these companies are uniqu@@ ely placed to move new ideas and technologies into ear@@ ly-@@ stage demonstration projects , thereby acceler@@ ating global learning cycles .
equally important , we need a critical mass of respected corporate leaders to press their pe@@ ers to cease the anti-@@ environmental lob@@ b@@ ying and campaign@@ -@@ finance practices that account for the in@@ action of governments .
sustainable development is a gener@@ ational challenge , not a short-term task .
the rein@@ vention of energy , food , transport , and other systems will take decades , not years .
but the long-term nature of this challenge must not l@@ ull us into in@@ action .
we must start re@@ inv@@ enting our productive systems now , precisely because the path of change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already so pressing .
at the ri@@ o + 20 summit this past jun@@ e , the world ’ s governments agreed to adopt a new set of goals on sustainable development for the period after 2015 , to build upon the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals ’ success in reducing poverty , hunger , and disease .
in the post-@@ 2015 era , the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand , reinforcing each other .
sec@@ retary-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon has already initiated several global processes to help establish the new post-@@ 2015 goals in an open , particip@@ atory , and knowledge-based way .
the secret@@ ary general ’ s launch of the sustainable development solutions network is therefore especially timely .
not only will the world adopt a new set of goals to achieve sustainable development , but it will also have a new global network of expertise to help achieve those vital objectives .
a good rate hi@@ ke for europ@@ e
two wron@@ gs don ’ t make a right .
just because europ@@ ean governments have failed to put bread on their constitu@@ ents ’ tables doesn ’ t mean that the europ@@ ean central bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone .
that may sound obvious , but aband@@ oning price stability is exactly what some europ@@ ean politicians are advoc@@ ating .
for example , itali@@ an politicians , who , given ital@@ y ’ s recent dis@@ mal economic performance , would seem the least qualified to offer the ec@@ b advice on monetary policy , are nonetheless advoc@@ ating interest@@ -@@ rate cuts .
ech@@ o@@ ing comments by itali@@ an prime minister sil@@ vio ber@@ lus@@ coni , dep@@ uty economics minister mari@@ o bal@@ d@@ ass@@ ar@@ ri said in il sole 24 ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in v@@ ain “ if someone is pushing on the bra@@ ke pe@@ dal . ”
who ’ s he kid@@ ding ?
if anyone is “ pushing down on the itali@@ an growth bra@@ ke ” it is ber@@ lus@@ coni himself .
he has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ec@@ b for ital@@ y ’ s l@@ ame economic performance .
but it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made ital@@ y one of the least competitive states in the euro@@ -@@ zone economy .
pressures are mounting on the ec@@ b to raise interest rates – and ber@@ lus@@ coni and co . ’ s attacks are as much as an attempt to fore@@ st@@ all future rate hi@@ kes as to get the ec@@ b to loo@@ sen its monetary policy .
but higher energy prices , by themselves , will not cause the ec@@ b to pull the interest@@ -@@ rate trigger .
the key will be so-called “ second-@@ round effects ” – whether growing cru@@ de prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions .
so far , the “ social partners , ” as ec@@ b president je@@ an-@@ c@@ lau@@ de tri@@ chet li@@ kes to call the unions , have been quiet .
should this change , the ec@@ b will have to raise rates even if europ@@ e ’ s economic growth remains s@@ lack .
the good news is that economic growth in the euro@@ -@@ zone economy appears to be pi@@ cking up ( even in ital@@ y ) .
though second-@@ quarter g@@ d@@ p growth was weak — the euro@@ -@@ zone average was only 0.@@ 3 % year on year – third-@@ quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pi@@ ck@@ -up in the second half of the year .
only consumption is lag@@ ging .
how will the ec@@ b react to better economic news ?
some on the governing council have grown un@@ comfortable that euro@@ -@@ zone interest rates have stayed so low , at 2 % , for so long ( more than two years ) .
true , there is no inflation problem in the short run , but the ec@@ b ’ s monetary policy focuses on the medium term .
one particular worry is that euro@@ -@@ zone money supply is well above the ec@@ b ’ s bench@@ mark level , indicating an excess supply of liquidity .
it is doub@@ tful that the ec@@ b would raise interest rates to cur@@ b excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question .
slow growth has si@@ len@@ ced the mon@@ et@@ ar@@ ists on the ec@@ b ’ s governing council .
this will change , however , once the economic pi@@ ck@@ -up is confirmed .
interest@@ -@@ rate hi@@ kes may be coming sooner rather than later , which is why ber@@ lus@@ coni and f@@ ren@@ ch president j@@ acqu@@ es chi@@ rac are talking up interest@@ -@@ rate cuts now .
mean@@ while , in ger@@ many , the elections this se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber may have surprising consequences for ec@@ b monetary policy .
angel@@ a merk@@ el , the ch@@ ris@@ tian democ@@ rats ’ candidate , is a re@@ former , holding out hope for ger@@ many ’ s future – and that of europ@@ e .
unfortunately , merk@@ el ’ s campaign is off to a ro@@ cky start , and the recent entry of o@@ sk@@ ar la@@ fon@@ taine ’ s extreme le@@ ft-@@ wing party into the fra@@ y may nec@@ es@@ sit@@ ate the formation of a grand coalition between the ch@@ ris@@ tian democ@@ rats and the social democ@@ rats .
this would be bad news for the german economy , which could delay possible ec@@ b interest rate hi@@ kes .
because the expected gri@@ d@@ lock in parliament would make reforms less likely , companies might hold off on investment , while consumers would be more likely to keep their wal@@ lets closed , because official policy would be even less clear than it is now .
on the other hand , a c@@ enter@@ -@@ right coalition between the ch@@ ris@@ tian democ@@ rats and the free democ@@ rats could spar@@ k the ec@@ b into action .
this raises an interesting point .
the public should be relie@@ ved if the ec@@ b raises rates , because this would most likely signal that the long-@@ awa@@ ited economic recovery is well under way , and that infl@@ ation@@ ary repercussions are being addressed .
a hi@@ ke , in other words , would indicate that good things are happening .
but the public often views interest@@ -@@ rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and sti@@ f@@ le growth .
bl@@ am@@ e-@@ game politicians like ber@@ lus@@ coni , who have failed to put bread on the table , their mini@@ ons in the media , and ke@@ yn@@ esian economic prof@@ essors who don ’ t understand and mis@@ represent ke@@ yn@@ es sustain this distor@@ ted view .
europ@@ e would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth .
a grand bar@@ gain with ir@@ an
the spec@@ ter of a nuclear ir@@ an ha@@ un@@ ts arab@@ s and isra@@ eli@@ s alike , but it is the united states and isra@@ el that are the driving force behind efforts to cur@@ tail ir@@ an ’ s nuclear ambitions .
the ameri@@ c@@ a-@@ ir@@ an-@@ isra@@ el tri@@ angle is where the clu@@ e to the problem and its possible solution lie .
though ay@@ at@@ ol@@ lah k@@ hom@@ ein@@ i ’ s islam@@ ic revolution in 1979 dis@@ rupted isra@@ el ’ s old alliance with ir@@ an , the two countries continued to conduct business with ameri@@ ca ’ s bl@@ essing .
the ir@@ an-@@ con@@ tra affair of the 1980 ’ s , through which isra@@ el supplied arms to the islam@@ ic re@@ public in its war against i@@ ra@@ q is a case in point .
isra@@ el and ir@@ an , two non-@@ ar@@ ab powers in a hosti@@ le ar@@ ab environment , shared fundamental interests that the islam@@ ic revolution could not change .
it was during y@@ itz@@ ha@@ k ra@@ bin ’ s government in the early 1990 ’ s that isra@@ el and ir@@ an entered into open conflict , owing to the changing strategic environment after ameri@@ ca ’ s victory in the first g@@ ulf war and the collapse of the so@@ vi@@ et union .
the us-@@ spon@@ sored arab@@ -@@ isra@@ eli peace process , which produced a series of breathtaking achievements – the ma@@ dri@@ d peace conference , the os@@ lo acc@@ ords , isra@@ el ’ s peace agreement with jord@@ an , a near@@ -@@ rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with sy@@ ria , and isra@@ el ’ s in@@ roads into ar@@ ab states from mor@@ occo to q@@ atar – was an increasingly isolated ir@@ an ’ s worst night@@ mare .
it was at that cross@@ roads that isra@@ el and ir@@ an , two powers v@@ ying for master@@ y in a rapidly changing middle east , chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms .
the conflict was now between isra@@ el , a be@@ ac@@ on of democracy fighting the expansion of a shi@@ ite ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ anti@@ st emp@@ ire , and an ir@@ an that chose to protect its revolution by mobi@@ liz@@ ing the ar@@ ab m@@ asses in the name of islam@@ ic values and against tre@@ ach@@ erous rul@@ ers who had betra@@ yed the dis@@ poss@@ essed pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans .
more an enemy of isra@@ eli@@ -@@ ar@@ ab reconciliation than of isra@@ el as such , the mul@@ la@@ hs ’ resort to an inc@@ endi@@ ary anti-@@ je@@ wish , pan@@ -@@ islam@@ ic dis@@ course is aimed at ending ir@@ an ’ s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light pal@@ at@@ able to the sun@@ ni m@@ asses .
in an ar@@ ab middle east , ir@@ an is the natural enemy ; in an islam@@ ic world , ir@@ an is a potential leader .
ir@@ on@@ ically , ir@@ an has been the main suppor@@ ter of ar@@ ab democracy , for the best way to undermine the inc@@ umb@@ ent regimes is to promote popul@@ arly based islam@@ ist movements such as he@@ z@@ bollah in le@@ ban@@ on , the mus@@ li@@ m bro@@ ther@@ hood in eg@@ yp@@ t , ham@@ as in pal@@ est@@ ine , and the shi@@ ite majority in i@@ ra@@ q .
y@@ itz@@ ha@@ k ra@@ bin believed that an isra@@ eli@@ -@@ ar@@ ab peace could prevent a nuclear ir@@ an , but now his night@@ mare seems rapidly appro@@ aching .
as an anti-@@ status quo power , ir@@ an is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy isra@@ el , but to gain pres@@ tige and influence in a hosti@@ le environment and as a sh@@ ield for its challenge to the regional order .
but isra@@ el has every reason to be concerned , for a nuclear ir@@ an would undermine the promise of zion@@ ism to secure a je@@ wish refu@@ ge – the core r@@ ationale of isra@@ el ’ s own strategy of “ nuclear ambigu@@ ity ” – and would em@@ bol@@ den its enemies throughout the region .
it would also trigger un@@ controlled regional nuclear proliferation , with sau@@ di arab@@ ia and eg@@ yp@@ t leading the way .
a military attack on ir@@ an ’ s nuclear facilities is too dangerous , and its results uncertain .
and , however severe economic sanctions might be , they might not bring ir@@ an to its kne@@ es .
nor is it clear that the split within the ir@@ anian elite between revolutionary pur@@ ists and those with a mer@@ chan@@ t-@@ class ment@@ ality would lead to regime change any time soon .
however , being radical does not necessarily mean being ir@@ rational , and revolutionary ir@@ an has given frequent proof of its pragmati@@ s@@ m .
in the ameri@@ can@@ -@@ ir@@ anian equ@@ ation it was the us , not ir@@ an , that conducted rigi@@ d ideological diplomacy .
ir@@ an backed the us during the first g@@ ulf war , but was left out of the ma@@ dri@@ d peace conference .
ir@@ an also supported ameri@@ ca in its war to de@@ pose the tali@@ ban in afgh@@ an@@ istan .
and , when us forces over@@ ran sad@@ dam hus@@ sein ’ s army in the spring of 2003 , the en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed ir@@ ani@@ ans proposed a grand bar@@ gain that would put all conten@@ tious issues on the table , from the nuclear issue to isra@@ el , from he@@ z@@ bollah to ham@@ as .
the ir@@ ani@@ ans also ple@@ dged to stop ob@@ struc@@ ting the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ ar@@ ab peace process .
but , neo-@@ conservative hau@@ gh@@ tin@@ ess – “ we don ’ t speak to evil ” – ruled out a pragmatic response to ir@@ an ’ s de@@ mar@@ che .
ir@@ an ’ s mood changed by the time ameri@@ ca ’ s entire middle east strategy had gone ad@@ ri@@ ft , but the grand bar@@ gain remains the only viable way out of the im@@ pas@@ se .
this would not be achieved , however , through an inevitably im@@ perfect sanctions regime , or by ameri@@ ca ’ s resort to cold war logic aimed at breaking ir@@ an ’ s back@@ bone by drawing it into a ru@@ in@@ ous arms race .
ir@@ an ’ s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expendi@@ tures , which are far lower than those of its enemies , but from its challenge to ameri@@ ca and isra@@ el through an ast@@ ute use of soft power .
there is no better way to under@@ cut ir@@ an ’ s regional strategy of dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zation than a comprehensive arab@@ -@@ isra@@ eli peace , accompanied by massive investments in human development , and followed by an internationally spon@@ sored system of peace and security in a veri@@ fi@@ ably nu@@ clear@@ -@@ free middle east , including isra@@ el .
a grav@@ ity test for the euro
cam@@ bridge – although i appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand , i find today ’ s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysteri@@ ous .
do the g@@ nom@@ es of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments ’ latest “ comprehensive package ” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months ?
the new plan re@@ lies on a question@@ able mix of du@@ bi@@ ous finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ engineering gi@@ mm@@ i@@ cks and v@@ ague promises of modest asi@@ an funding .
even the best part of the plan , the proposed ( but not really agreed ) 50 % hair@@ cut for priv@@ ate-@@ sector holders of gre@@ ek sovereign debt , is not sufficient to stabili@@ ze that country ’ s profound debt and growth problems .
so how is it that the euro is trading at a 40 % premium to the us dollar , even as investors continue to view southern europ@@ ean government debt with great skep@@ tic@@ ism ?
i can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall , and six no@@ t-@@ so-@@ convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate .
let ’ s begin with why the euro needs to fall .
ab@@ sent a clear path to a much ti@@ ghter fiscal and political union , which can lead only through constitutional change , the current hal@@ f@@ way house of the euro system appears increasingly un@@ ten@@ able .
it seems clear that the europ@@ ean central bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign ( jun@@ k ) bonds .
that may work in the short term , but if sovereign default risks materi@@ alize – as my research with car@@ men rein@@ hart suggests is likely – the ec@@ b will in turn have to be rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ zed .
and , if the stronger northern eurozone countries are un@@ willing to di@@ gest this transfer – and political resistance runs high – the ec@@ b may be forced to rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ ze itself through money creation .
either way , the threat of a profound financial crisis is high .
given this , what arguments support the current value of the euro , or its further rise ?
first , investors might be telling themselves that in the wor@@ st-@@ case scenario , the northern europ@@ ean countries will effectively push out the weaker countries , creating a super@@ -@@ euro .
but , while this scenario has a certain ring of truth , surely any break@@ up would be highly trau@@ matic , with the euro diving before its ru@@ mp form recovered .
second , investors may be remember@@ ing that even though the dollar was at the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the 2008 financial pan@@ ic , the consequences radi@@ ated so widely that , parado@@ x@@ ically , the dollar actually rose in value .
although it may be difficult to connect the do@@ ts , it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snow@@ ball effect in the us and elsewhere .
perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through us banks , many of which remain vulnerable , owing to thin cap@@ itali@@ zation and huge port@@ folios of mort@@ g@@ ages booked far above their market value .
third , foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to he@@ dge against risks to the us and their own economies .
government investors are not necessarily driven by the re@@ tur@@ n-@@ maxim@@ izing calcul@@ us that motiv@@ ates private investors .
if foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro ’ s strength , the risk is that foreign sovereign euro bu@@ yers will eventually fle@@ e , just as private investors would , only in a faster and more concentrated way .
fourth , investors may believe that , ultimately , us risks are just as large as europ@@ e ’ s .
true , the us political system seems sty@@ mi@@ ed in coming up with a plan to stabili@@ ze medium-term budget deficits .
whereas the us congress ’ s “ super@@ committee , ” charged with formul@@ ating a fis@@ cal@@ -@@ consolidation package , will likely come up with a proposal , it is far from clear that either re@@ public@@ ans or democ@@ rats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year .
moreover , investors might be worried that the us federal reserve will wei@@ gh in with a third round of “ quantitative eas@@ ing , ” which would further drive down the dollar .
fifth , the current value of the euro does not seem wil@@ dly out of line on a purch@@ as@@ ing-@@ power basis . an exchange rate of $ 1.4 : € 1 is cheap for ger@@ many ’ s export power@@ house , which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro .
for the eurozone ’ s southern peripher@@ y , however , today ’ s euro rate is very difficult to manage .
whereas some german companies persu@@ aded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis , wages across the southern peripher@@ y have been mar@@ ching steadily up@@ wards , even as productivity has remained stag@@ n@@ ant .
but , because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone ’ s north and south , one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range .
finally , investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders ’ latest plan will work , even though the last do@@ zen plans have failed .
ab@@ ra@@ ham lin@@ col@@ n is credi@@ ted with saying “ you can f@@ ool some of the people all of the time , and all of the people some of the time , but you cannot f@@ ool all of the people all of the time . ” a comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time , but not for all of the countries any@@ time soon .
so , yes , there are plenty of v@@ agu@@ ely plau@@ sible reasons why the euro , despite its dra@@ wn@@ -@@ out crisis , has remained so firm against the dollar so far .
but don ’ t count on a stable euro@@ -@@ dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead .
a gre@@ ek cat@@ ch-@@ 22
bu@@ en@@ os ai@@ res – desper@@ ate times bring desper@@ ate measures .
the latest package to cope with gre@@ ece ’ s in@@ solvency offers a bond bu@@ y@@ back to ligh@@ ten the country ’ s debt burden .
in essence , this is a back@@ -@@ door debt restructuring : europ@@ e ’ s ba@@ il@@ out fund , the europ@@ ean financial stability facility ( ef@@ s@@ f ) would lend the money for gre@@ ece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts , thereby imposing a loss on private bon@@ d@@ holders without the need to declare a default .
a recurr@@ ent characteristic of europ@@ e ’ s deb@@ t-@@ crisis debate is a l@@ atin ameri@@ can prece@@ dent .
bo@@ li@@ via ’ s 1988 bu@@ y@@ back of close to half of its def@@ aul@@ ted sovereign debt , an operation funded by international donors , is a classic example .
but the most relevant l@@ atin ameri@@ can experience with debt bu@@ y@@ backs is a more recent and far less studied case : ec@@ u@@ ador in 2008 .
president ra@@ fa@@ el cor@@ rea had been to@@ ying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign ( debt re@@ pu@@ di@@ ation was part of his platform ) , and quickly earned a cc@@ c rating from fit@@ ch .
the reasons invo@@ ked by cor@@ rea ( legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange ) were beside the point .
the default threat was a way to de@@ press bond prices in secondary markets , only to buy them back at a discount through the back door .
that task was out@@ sour@@ ced to b@@ anc@@ o del pac@@ í@@ fic@@ o , which bought the so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be@@ -@@ def@@ aul@@ ted ec@@ u@@ ad@@ orian paper at 20 c@@ ents on the dollar and above – a level low enough for a deep hair@@ cut but high enough to f@@ end off “ vul@@ ture ” investors .
to speed things up , after the default was declared in dec@@ ember 2008 , ec@@ u@@ ador completed the bu@@ y@@ back with an in@@ verse auction for the remaining bon@@ d@@ holders , to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the leg@@ ality of under@@ cover purchases was likely to be ques@@ tioned .
with the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands , and institutional bon@@ d@@ holders pressed to liqui@@ date their positions in the midst of the post-@@ leh@@ man bro@@ thers sel@@ lo@@ ff , the operation was a success .
this episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt bu@@ y@@ backs .
the first concerns the market response .
jud@@ ging from the recent evolution of ec@@ u@@ ad@@ orian bond yiel@@ ds , it appears that markets have not pun@@ ished ec@@ u@@ ador ’ s behavior : ec@@ u@@ ador , an oil expor@@ ter bl@@ essed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices , could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange .
this is particularly notable , given that ec@@ u@@ ador ’ s was perhaps the first opport@@ un@@ istic default ( triggered by un@@ willingness , rather than in@@ ability , to pay ) in recent history .
the second lesson , and the one most per@@ tin@@ ent to europ@@ e now , concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario .
indeed , almost two years of default threats by cor@@ rea were not enough to e@@ licit a deep discount .
ec@@ u@@ ador needed to go all the way to a “ credit event ” in dec@@ ember 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bar@@ gain prices .
the pre@@ mise that only a credible default ensures significant priv@@ ate-@@ sector involvement ( that is , that private bon@@ d@@ holders take a real hit ) is apparent when we compare the market-@@ friendly ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an debt exchange in 2003 with the dra@@ con@@ ian ar@@ gent@@ ine restructuring of 2005 .
in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay , what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nomin@@ al hair@@ cuts and only minor debt relief ; in ar@@ gent@@ ina , a four-@@ year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nomin@@ al hair@@ cuts above 50 % .
so the question arises : how are private bon@@ d@@ holders to be convinced to get rid of their gre@@ ek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort ?
if europ@@ e credi@@ bly volunte@@ ered funds to buy back all gre@@ ek debt , the gre@@ ek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully ba@@ iled out .
only the prob@@ ability of a default – and the goal of avoiding even deeper hair@@ cuts – can in@@ duce investors to liqui@@ date their positions at a discount .
but the bu@@ y@@ back can succeed only if the market perc@@ ei@@ ves it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring .
in other words , a successful bu@@ y@@ back is a pre@@ am@@ ble to default .
can gre@@ ece , with the ef@@ s@@ f ’ s help , obtain debt relief while avoiding default ?
small purchases at current pan@@ ic prices , vul@@ tu@@ re-@@ fund style , are always possible , but they do not promise substantial debt relief .
large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market , defe@@ ating the point of the whole operation .
and the op@@ a@@ que ec@@ u@@ ad@@ orian methods are not possible in europ@@ e , both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be dis@@ gu@@ ised or out@@ sour@@ ced .
but what if the ef@@ s@@ f were to m@@ im@@ ic b@@ anc@@ o del pac@@ í@@ fic@@ o in a transparent way , say , by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund bu@@ y-@@ backs of any gre@@ ek bond in the market ?
naturally , the spread would automatically conver@@ ge to the threshold , but how much would be sold ?
would the ef@@ s@@ f be reti@@ ring gre@@ ek debt at bar@@ gain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bon@@ d@@ holders ?
if the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount , the stock of debt reti@@ red by the bu@@ y@@ back would be margin@@ al .
after all , by c@@ app@@ ing spre@@ ads , the bu@@ y@@ back facility would limit the down@@ side risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the up@@ side – a good reason , perhaps , to make the facility a temporary offer .
by contrast , if the threshold is set low enough to bring spre@@ ads down from pan@@ ic levels , purchases will be more substantive , but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective hair@@ cut on private holders .
a debt bu@@ y@@ back is something of a catch 22 : to succeed in in@@ duc@@ ing a hair@@ cut , it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to allevi@@ ate .
without ec@@ u@@ ador ’ s gi@@ mm@@ i@@ cks , bu@@ y@@ backs do not seem to be the solution to gre@@ ece ’ s debt over@@ hang .
ethics and agriculture
mel@@ bour@@ ne – should rich countries – or investors based there – be buying agricultural land in developing countries ?
that question is raised in transnational land deals for agriculture in the global south , a report issued last year by the land mat@@ rix partnership , a con@@ sortium of europ@@ ean research institutes and non@@ governmental organizations .
the report shows that since 2000 , investors or state bodies in rich or emerging countries have bought more than 83 million hectares ( more than 200 million acres ) of agricultural land in poorer developing countries .
this amounts to 1.@@ 7 % of the world ’ s agricultural land .
most of these purchases have been made in afri@@ ca , with two-@@ thirds taking place in countries where hunger is widespread and institutions for establishing formal land ownership are often weak .
the purchases in afri@@ ca alone amount to an area of agricultural land the size of ken@@ ya .
it has been claimed that foreign investors are purchasing land that has been left id@@ le ; thus , by bringing it into production , the purchases are increasing the availability of food overall .
but the land mat@@ rix partnership report found that this is not the case : roughly 45 % of the purchases involved existing cro@@ pl@@ ands , and almost a third of the purchased land was fore@@ sted , indicating that its development may pose risks for biodiversity .
the investments are both private and public ( for example , by state-@@ owned entities ) and come from three different groups of countries : emerging economies like ch@@ ina , indi@@ a , bra@@ zi@@ l , south afri@@ ca , mal@@ ay@@ sia , and south korea ; o@@ il-@@ rich g@@ ulf states ; and weal@@ thy developed economies like the united states and several europ@@ ean countries .
on average , per capita income in the countries that are the source of these investments is four times higher than in the target countries .
most of the investments are aimed at producing food or other crops for export from the countries in which the land is acquired , for the obvious reason that ri@@ cher countries can pay more for the output .
more than 40 % of such projects aim to export food to the source country – sugge@@ sting that food security is a major reason for buying the land .
its own report , our land , our lives , indicates that , since 2008 , communities affected by world bank projects have brought 21 formal complaints alleg@@ ing violations of their land rights .
ox@@ f@@ am , drawing attention to large-scale land acqu@@ isi@@ tions that have ent@@ ailed direct rights violations , has called on the bank to free@@ ze investments in land purchases until it can set standards ensuring that local communities are informed of them in advance , with the option of ref@@ using them .
ox@@ f@@ am also wants the bank to ensure that these land deals do not undermine either local or national food security .
in response , the world bank agreed that there are instances of abuse in land acquisition , particularly in developing countries in which governance is weak , and said that it supported more transparent and inclusive participation .
at the same time , it pointed to the need to increase food production to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive in 2050 , and suggested that more investment in agriculture in developing countries is required to improve productivity .
the bank rejected the idea of a moratorium on its own work with investors in agriculture , argu@@ ing that this would target precisely those who are most likely to do the right thing .
one may ask whether transparency and the requirement that local land@@ holders consent to a sale is enough to protect people living in poverty .
supporters of free markets will argue that if local land@@ owners wish to sell their land , that is their choice to make .
but , given the pressures of poverty and the l@@ ure of cash , what does it take for people to be able to make a genuinely free and informed choice about selling something as significant as a right to land ?
after all , we do not allow poor people to sell their kid@@ neys to the highest bi@@ d@@ der .
of course , hard@@ line supporters of free markets will say that we should .
but , at the very least , it needs to be explained why people should be prohibited from selling kid@@ neys , but not from selling the land that gro@@ ws their food .
most people can live without one kid@@ ney .
no one can live without food .
why does the purchase of body parts give rise to international condem@@ nation , while the purchase of agricultural land does not – even when it involves evi@@ c@@ ting local land@@ holders and producing food for export to rich countries instead of for local consumption ?
the world bank may indeed be more concerned about local land@@ holders ’ rights than other foreign investors are .
if so , the 21 complaints made against bank projects are most likely the visible tip of a vast ic@@ e@@ berg of violations of land rights by foreign investors in agricultural projects in developing countries – with the others remaining inv@@ isi@@ ble because victims have no access to any complaint procedure .
one such case bel@@ at@@ edly came to the attention of the united nations human rights committee .
in nov@@ ember , the committee concluded that ger@@ many had failed to police the ne@@ um@@ ann k@@ aff@@ ee gruppe regarding its complic@@ ity in the forced evi@@ ction of several villages in ug@@ anda to make way for a large coffee plant@@ ation .
but the evi@@ c@@ tions took place in 2001 , and the vil@@ lag@@ ers are still living in extreme poverty .
they found no remedy , in either ug@@ anda or ger@@ many , for the violation of rights that , according to the committee , they possess under the international co@@ ven@@ ant on civil and political rights , to which ger@@ many is a signat@@ ory .
are we to believe that land@@ holders fare better with chin@@ ese or sau@@ di investors ?
how to feed the world
pra@@ gue – hunger has wra@@ cked humanity since time im@@ mem@@ orial .
nearly every major society has been shaped by fam@@ ine ; one estimate suggests that ch@@ ina suffered d@@ rought or floo@@ d-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed star@@ v@@ ation in at least one province almost every year from 108 b@@ c to 19@@ 11 .
yet the struggle against hunger is a battle that humanity could finally win .
more cereals were produced annually in the last quarter of the twen@@ tieth century than in any prec@@ eding period , and more grain will be har@@ vest@@ ed this year than at any time in history .
since 1992 , the number of hung@@ ry people worldwide has pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed by more than 200 million , even as the human population grew by nearly two billion .
but enormous challenges remain .
affordable , nutri@@ tious food is one of people ’ s top priorities everywhere , and one in nine people still do not get enough food to be healthy .
with today ’ s population of 7.@@ 3 billion expected to reach 8.@@ 5 billion by 2030 and 9.@@ 7 billion in 2050 , food demand will increase accordingly .
along with more mou@@ ths to feed , stresses on food supplies will include conflicts , economic vol@@ atility , extreme weather events , and climate change .
increases in agricultural productivity , owing to improvements in seeds , new fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers and pesticides , improved credit access , and technological break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s , have been a key driver in reducing hunger .
between 1930 and 2000 , agricultural output in the united states qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pled , with productivity growth out@@ stri@@ pping that of manufacturing .
developing countries have begun sharing in these gains : responsible for ne@@ x@@ t-@@ to-@@ none of the world ’ s fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er consumption in 1960 , by 2000 they used more than industri@@ alized countries .
the world bank has found that productivity growth in agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth from other sectors .
so how do we keep up this progress ?
investment in research and development is vital .
according to research conducted for cop@@ enhagen consensus , which i direct , investing an extra $ 88 billion in agricultural r &@@ amp@@ ; d over the next 15 years would increase yiel@@ ds by an additional 0.@@ 4 percentage points each year , which could save 79 million people from hunger and prevent five million cases of child mal@@ no@@ ur@@ ishment .
achieving these targets would be worth nearly $ 3 tril@@ lion in social good , im@@ plying an enormous return of $ 34 for every dollar spent .
scientific break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s also play a key role in fighting specific nutri@@ tional challenges such as vit@@ amin a defici@@ ency , the leading cause of prev@@ ent@@ able childhood blin@@ dness .
ro@@ bert m@@ w@@ ang@@ a was awarded this year ’ s world food prize for inspir@@ ing work that resulted in the large-scale replacement of white sweet pot@@ ato ( with sc@@ ant vit@@ amin a content ) by a vit@@ amin a-@@ rich alternative in the di@@ ets of ug@@ anda ’ s rural poor .
another way to increase agricultural productivity is through labor .
when cop@@ enhagen consensus researchers examined responses to global warming in b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h , they found that increasing agricultural labor productivity “ is the only way to increase the re@@ sili@@ ence of b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h to climate change and to meet long-term development goals . ”
investing around $ 9@@ ,000 per worker over two decades could boost agricultural productivity by 10 % .
b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h is an instruc@@ tive case , because it is sus@@ cep@@ tible to floo@@ ding and the effects of climate change , and its agricultural productivity lags behind other developing and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries .
un@@ sur@@ pris@@ ingly , the b@@ ang@@ lades@@ hi prime minister ’ s office is stri@@ ving to lead in global innovation , su@@ sta@@ ining an agriculture innovation la@@ b that shares best practices and ideas .
cop@@ enhagen consensus has worked with the world ’ s largest n@@ go , bra@@ c , to find out the policy wishes of people living in rural b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h , including the “ ultra-@@ poor ” with whom bra@@ c works closely .
these labor@@ ers , hou@@ se@@ wi@@ ves , and others , some of whom live on the equivalent of $ 0.@@ 6@@ 0-@@ 0.@@ 70 or less a day , are sel@@ dom given a place at the table to discuss policy .
a mu@@ k@@ im@@ ab@@ ad vil@@ lager had the same vision for b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h : “ we need crops and seeds which are not vulnerable to sal@@ in@@ ity and flood so that we do not have to die from food short@@ ages . ”
humanity ’ s fight against hunger can be won .
great progress has been made , but the world needs more agricultural r &@@ amp@@ ; d and higher productivity .
as a rural vil@@ lager from deu@@ k@@ hol@@ a , near the bra@@ h@@ ma@@ put@@ ra river in remote northern b@@ ang@@ lades@@ h , stark@@ ly put it : “ our survival depends on it . ” we would do well to listen .
an ar@@ ab mar@@ shall plan
ox@@ ford – the wave of revol@@ ts that swe@@ pt across the ar@@ ab world two years ago were fu@@ eled by demands for freedom , bread , and social justice .
but , although the revolu@@ tions top@@ pled dict@@ ators and transformed societies , these core objectives remain as distant as ever .
in fact , the economic challenges facing the ar@@ ab spring countries have become even more pressing , weigh@@ ing heavily on these countries ’ political prospects .
unemployment has nearly dou@@ bled in tun@@ isi@@ a and eg@@ yp@@ t , and foreign direct investment has dri@@ ed up across the ar@@ ab world .
tourism revenues , while re@@ sili@@ ent , are declining , and fiscal challenges remain considerable .
but the economic urgency is not reflected in the policy response , which has been pain@@ fully slow or non-@@ exist@@ ent .
for example , eg@@ yp@@ t ’ s fiscal deficit will exceed 11 % of g@@ d@@ p this year .
but the country ’ s leaders have been st@@ alling on the terms of a mu@@ ch-@@ needed international monetary fund loan .
the government ’ s reduction of fuel subsidies last year was not followed by additional reforms , and the required tax increase was delayed soon after president mo@@ ham@@ ed mor@@ si announced it .
almost all political stakeholders in eg@@ yp@@ t , as in the other ar@@ ab countries in transition , recognize the need for economic reform .
in a charged and uncertain political climate , in which new crises erup@@ t on a daily basis , it is un@@ surprising that economic reform has been postponed repeatedly .
politicians know that macroeconomic stabili@@ zation and social cohesion can be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able in the short run .
s@@ lash@@ ing food and energy subsidies in order to reduce fiscal stra@@ in is unlikely to win favor in a country like eg@@ yp@@ t , where 40 % of per capita income is allocated to food .
politics is thus constra@@ ining efforts to strengthen public finances .
at the same time , narrow im@@ f pres@@ crip@@ tions threaten to exacerb@@ ate political instability , with citizens no longer afraid to take to the streets to demonstrate their dis@@ satisfaction .
the current im@@ pas@@ se on economic reform highlights a larger point : subsidy and tax regimes cannot be reformed without first re@@ defining the underlying social contract , which has long ex@@ changed welfare distribution for political acqui@@ esc@@ ence .
but such a move is far too ris@@ ky for an individual politi@@ cian , or even a single country , at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment .
in order to create the political space needed for economic reform , ar@@ ab leaders must under@@ write a regional growth pact – a mar@@ shall plan of sorts – that would facilitate major new investments aimed at revi@@ ving economic activity .
it is much easier to reform subsidy programs when the economy is expanding .
to this end , regional trade barriers , which are more per@@ va@@ sive in the ar@@ ab world than even in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca , must be disman@@ t@@ led .
by agreeing to the pact , ar@@ ab countries would commit to reforming their subsidy systems and to reducing restrictions on cross-border economic exchange .
the regional dimension of prosperity has long been ignored in the ar@@ ab world .
but weak regional lin@@ k@@ ages limit small firms ’ growth potential , forcing them to depend on state pat@@ ron@@ age .
although ar@@ ab leaders often c@@ ite tur@@ key as a be@@ ac@@ on of hope , they rarely acknowledge that the country ’ s recent transformation from the “ si@@ ck man of europ@@ e ” to one of the world ’ s fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing emerging markets would not have been possible had it not pursued regional synergies .
such lin@@ k@@ ages are particularly important for eg@@ yp@@ t and tun@@ isi@@ a , which will struggle to reduce unemployment unless li@@ b@@ ya ’ s labor market – which has histor@@ ically absor@@ bed migrants from its north afri@@ can neigh@@ b@@ ors – is re@@ opened .
and , while tun@@ isi@@ a ’ s situation seems to be the most promising , a crip@@ pling investment short@@ fall is threatening to der@@ ail reform efforts there .
with europ@@ e mi@@ red in crisis , capital flows from tun@@ isi@@ a ’ s re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ rich ar@@ ab neigh@@ b@@ ors are its best hope .
furthermore , ar@@ ab countries must rat@@ chet up development spending .
given that existing development banks in the region have largely failed to act as vehicles of coordination and commitment , a new institution – resem@@ bling the europ@@ ean bank for reconstruction and development – would have to be established to over@@ see a regional aid push and under@@ write the costs of economic transition .
new investment vehicles , such as sovereign wealth funds and islam@@ ic finance , can contribute financing to credi@@ t-@@ star@@ ved firms .
at the same time , ar@@ ab countries must stream@@ line current aid efforts .
for too long , ar@@ ab governments have simply thrown money at problems , with the rich g@@ ulf countries effectively subsidi@@ zing their troub@@ led neigh@@ b@@ ors ’ public services .
over the last two years , sau@@ di arab@@ ia has provided more than $ 3 billion to y@@ emen .
q@@ atar has provided $ 5 billion to eg@@ yp@@ t since 2011 , with a promise of $ 3 billion more .
and the united ar@@ ab em@@ ir@@ ates recently ple@@ dged $ 2.5 billion to bah@@ rain .
but un@@ conditional aid only delays reforms , because it weak@@ ens budget constraints , which reduces pressure on policymakers and creates moral haz@@ ard .
the ar@@ ab spring has exposed fault lines that run not just through individual countries , but also through the entire region .
this calls for re@@ defining relationships not only between citizens and states , but also among ar@@ ab countries .
above all , it is no longer pru@@ dent to divide ar@@ ab countries between donors and recipi@@ ents , or between re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ rich and re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ poor countries .
it is in the interest of the entire region – including those countries that do not seem to face an im@@ min@@ ent threat of revol@@ t – to contribute to their neigh@@ b@@ ors ’ economic revi@@ val and facilitate their political transi@@ tions .
a history lesson for ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi
once again , protests against jap@@ anese prime minister j@@ uni@@ ch@@ ir@@ o ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi ’ s annual visit to the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i shr@@ ine are breaking out in ch@@ ina as well as south korea .
ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi ’ s insist@@ ence on paying hom@@ age to the war dead inter@@ red at y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i , where convic@@ ted war criminals from world war ii are among the bur@@ ied , has been damaging relations with jap@@ an ’ s neigh@@ b@@ ors for years .
indeed , chin@@ ese president h@@ u j@@ inta@@ o continually affir@@ ms that he will not hold a summit with a jap@@ anese prime minister who goes to y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i , which most chin@@ ese regard as a gl@@ ori@@ fication of past jap@@ anese aggres@@ sion and col@@ oni@@ alism .
even some in jap@@ an are becoming critical of ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi .
while the public remains negative about chin@@ ese out@@ bur@@ sts against jap@@ an , a recent survey indicates that more than 70 % of jap@@ anese view the current state of jap@@ an-@@ ch@@ ina relations as unacceptable .
more people are not supporting ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi ’ s annual pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i , with seven former prime ministers jointly demanding that he refrain from the visits .
yet ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi remains de@@ fi@@ ant .
moreover , chief cab@@ inet secret@@ ary sh@@ in@@ zu abe , the fron@@ t-@@ run@@ ner to succeed him , has openly declared that he will continue to visit the shr@@ ine as prime minister .
foreign minister tar@@ o as@@ o , another possible successor to ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi , has called for the jap@@ anese em@@ peror to pra@@ y at y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i .
so p@@ essimis@@ m appears to be sett@@ ling in , and the dead@@ lock over y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i appears to be deepening .
but the past can bring us more than just troub@@ les of this kind . even on the issue of y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i , there are positive lessons to be learned .
both are conservative and nation@@ alistic , advoc@@ ating the revision of the constitution and an asser@@ tive political and military role for jap@@ an abroad .
finally , both are pro-@@ ameri@@ can , with n@@ ak@@ as@@ one declar@@ ing jap@@ an to be ameri@@ ca ’ s “ un@@ sin@@ k@@ able aircraft carrier ” in east a@@ sia and ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi sending troops to i@@ ra@@ q in support of the united stat@@ es-@@ led war effort .
but a crucial difference between n@@ ak@@ as@@ one and ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi is often over@@ looked : their handling of the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i contro@@ vers@@ y and relations with ch@@ ina .
n@@ ak@@ as@@ one broke the t@@ abo@@ o by being the first prime minister to wor@@ ship at the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i shr@@ ine in his official capacity on aug@@ ust 15 , 1985 , the for@@ tieth anniversary of the end of world war ii .
the decision triggered a severe response from ch@@ ina , where students held demonstrations against his visit .
bilateral relations were frozen .
but , instead of cap@@ itali@@ zing on domestic res@@ ent@@ ment over ch@@ ina ’ s critic@@ isms , n@@ ak@@ as@@ one decided not to visit y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i again .
he chose to mend relations with ch@@ ina by focusing on the positive aspects of bilateral ties .
in 1986 , n@@ ak@@ as@@ one went to bei@@ jing at the personal invitation of chin@@ ese communist party general secret@@ ary h@@ u y@@ a@@ ob@@ ang and laid the corner@@ stone for a sin@@ o-@@ jap@@ anese youth exchange center , promising to for@@ ge future friend@@ ships with ch@@ ina .
this genuine embra@@ ce of reconciliation provided mu@@ ch-@@ needed support to chin@@ ese leaders , who were e@@ ager to control anti-@@ jap@@ anese senti@@ ments .
h@@ u pra@@ ised n@@ ak@@ as@@ one ’ s courage and warned chin@@ ese youth publicly that if they “ think merely of the well-being of their own country … they are not so@@ ber-@@ minded patri@@ ots . ”
n@@ ak@@ as@@ one emerged from the crisis and was recognized as a capable stat@@ es@@ man in managing jap@@ an ’ s diplomacy with ch@@ ina .
there was no accus@@ ation that n@@ ak@@ as@@ one was “ selling out ” to bei@@ jing .
nor were his conservative , nation@@ alist , and pro-@@ ameri@@ can cre@@ denti@@ als damaged .
this episode suggests that ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi ’ s hard@@ line position isn ’ t the only option .
a jap@@ anese prime minister can be strong without explo@@ iting domestic res@@ ent@@ ment against the country ’ s neigh@@ b@@ ors , and conservative , patri@@ o@@ tic , and pro-@@ ameri@@ can while for@@ ging a healthy working relationship with ch@@ ina .
indeed , the c@@ ess@@ ation of y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i visits would likely open the door to the long-@@ over@@ due sin@@ o-@@ jap@@ anese summit , which in turn might strengthen moderate voices in ch@@ ina seeking a fut@@ ure-@@ oriented relationship with jap@@ an .
unfortunately , ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi and his allies are not prepared to move forward on the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i issue .
as foreign minister as@@ o recently put it : “ the more ch@@ ina voices &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; opposition &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; , the more one feels like going there .
it ’ s just like when you ’ re told ‘ don &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t smoke cigarettes , ’ it actually makes you want to smoke . ”
no one expects the current jap@@ anese and chin@@ ese leaders to embra@@ ce , as n@@ ak@@ as@@ one and h@@ u did two decades ago , but it is a sad state of affairs when the leaders of neighbor@@ ing gi@@ ants pre@@ tend not to see each other at international forums .
if n@@ ak@@ as@@ one , who now urges ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi to stop the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge , were to respond to as@@ o , he might simply extend the an@@ alog@@ y : it is not in jap@@ an ’ s national interest to continue to inhal@@ e ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi ’ s second-@@ hand smoke .
a human rights court for afri@@ ca
one crucial insight to be gained from a century of establishing international courts and tri@@ bun@@ als is that while momentum is vital , getting things right from the start is equally important .
with little fan@@ fare , jan@@ u@@ ary 25 , 2004 , marked a milestone in the history of the protection of human rights in afri@@ ca : the entry into force of the protocol for establishing an afri@@ can court on human and peoples &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; rights .
after europ@@ e and the ameri@@ cas , afri@@ ca will be the third continent with a regional court to red@@ ress human rights violations .
acceptance of the protocol in the last year by such influ@@ ential afri@@ can countries as al@@ geri@@ a , south afri@@ ca , and li@@ b@@ ya gave the final and sudden impetus to the court &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s establishment , and the critical threshold of fifteen rati@@ fications was reached shortly before the new year , when the com@@ or@@ os signed on .
but it is in countries like bur@@ undi , c@@ ô@@ te d &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ i@@ vo@@ ire , r@@ wand@@ a , and ug@@ anda , which have all ratified the protocol , that the court will likely play a major role in checking human rights abuses .
it can do so because the court &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s judgments will be legally binding and thus enfor@@ ce@@ able in national courts .
in states that accepted the court &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s jurisdiction , individuals will be able to gain access to the court directly , even to file cases against their own governments .
afri@@ can n@@ go &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s will be able to ask the court for advisory opinions , thus strengthening the effectiveness of the afri@@ can human rights regime .
clearly , the birth of an afri@@ can human rights court should be celebrated .
but it risks fo@@ undering in the do@@ cks , and its launch should therefore be deliber@@ ate , not r@@ ush@@ ed .
the process is now progres@@ sing at a star@@ tling - and worrying - pace .
nomin@@ ations for the first judges have been requested by the end of ap@@ ri@@ l , with the aim of holding elections at the afri@@ can union summit in addi@@ s ab@@ aba on ju@@ ly 5-@@ 7 .
experience elsewhere suggests that once judges have been appointed , rules of procedure drafted and adopted , and the relationship with other international organs shaped , the system will become fixed .
whatever f@@ aults and shortcomings are built in at the beginning will become locked in .
but building a sound international judicial body cannot be r@@ ush@@ ed ; it requires time and resources - both human and financial - and a lot of support .
it took more than four years to physi@@ cally establish the international criminal court , and it took a massive effort by the united nations , several major countries , and hundreds of experts , n@@ go &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s , and think tanks to get this done .
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , sometimes time is a luxury .
the international criminal tri@@ bunal for the former y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via ( ic@@ ty ) and r@@ wand@@ a ( ic@@ t@@ r ) opened for work in less than a year in order to begin addressing h@@ ein@@ ous crimes that were ongoing .
but the price of that r@@ ush job is evident : as cases started f@@ lowing in , the courts &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; governing statute and rules of procedure and evidence had to be pat@@ ched on the fly .
the statute of the ic@@ ty has been amended four times and the rules of procedure and evidence no less than twenty-@@ seven times .
figures for the ic@@ t@@ r are only slightly better .
that is a poor record for any court of law , which should afford defen@@ dants certainty and procedural fairness .
all this tin@@ k@@ ering could be done because there was an extraordinary consensus in the un security council on the need not to delay the trials .
but such agreement is extraordinary .
for courts established by treaty , like the afri@@ can court , it will likely prove very hard , if not impossible , to find the majority necessary to support changes .
moreover , effective courts must be politically independent .
but this can be achieved only if the right conditions are in place from the on@@ set .
the process for nomin@@ ating judges at the national level is critical .
candidates who are adequate - and who are widely seen to be adequate - are the key to the court &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s legitimacy .
in the europ@@ ean human rights system , the nomin@@ ating process involves civil society and severe scrutiny by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europ@@ e .
it is only through an open , transparent process that the best candidates - those who give the greatest guarantees of independence - can be identified .
but that takes time .
moreover , the first ben@@ ch of any international court is critic@@ ally important , because it is entru@@ sted to prepare and adopt other key documents - such as the rules of procedure , internal regulations , and financial regulations - that will go@@ vern the court for years to come .
when they meet in ju@@ ly in addi@@ s ab@@ aba , afri@@ can heads of state would be better off discussing where the court will be located , how it will be financed , and , most importantly , agreeing standards for an open , particip@@ atory , and transparent process for elec@@ ting its judges .
they should not r@@ ush into nomin@@ ating judges for a court that is still largely on the drawing board .
afri@@ ca is po@@ ised to establish its own human rights tri@@ bunal , fif@@ ty years after europ@@ e , 25 years after the ameri@@ cas , and two years after the international criminal court .
but , above all , afri@@ ca needs a human rights court that commands the un@@ reserved and un@@ mitig@@ ated respect of the continent &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s governments and peoples .
afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s leaders should take a few more months to do it right .
a human rights crime in ga@@ za
at@@ lan@@ ta -- the world is witness@@ ing a terrible human rights crime in ga@@ za , where a million and a half human beings are being im@@ pris@@ oned with almost no access to the outside world by sea , air , or land . an entire population is being brut@@ ally pun@@ ished .
this gross m@@ ist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of the pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans in ga@@ za was escal@@ ated dramatically by isra@@ el , with united states backing , after political candidates representing ham@@ as won a majority of seats in the pal@@ est@@ inian authority parliament in 2006 .
the election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers .
isra@@ el and the us refused to accept the right of pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans to form a unity government with ham@@ as and fat@@ ah and now , after internal stri@@ fe , ham@@ as alone controls ga@@ za . fort@@ y-@@ one of the 43 vic@@ t@@ orious ham@@ as candidates who lived in the west bank are now im@@ pris@@ oned by isra@@ el , plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-@@ lived coalition cab@@ inet .
regardless of one ’ s choice in the parti@@ s@@ an struggle between fat@@ ah and ham@@ as within occupied pal@@ est@@ ine , we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water , food , electricity , and fuel are causing extreme hard@@ ship among the innocent people in ga@@ za , about one million of whom are refugees .
isra@@ eli bom@@ bs and missi@@ les perio@@ di@@ cally strike the en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated area , causing high cas@@ u@@ alties among both milit@@ ants and innocent women and children .
prior to the highly publi@@ ci@@ zed killing of a woman and her four little children last week , this pattern was illustr@@ ated by a previous report from b ’ t@@ sel@@ em , the leading isra@@ eli human rights organization : 106 pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans were killed between f@@ ebru@@ ary 27 and mar@@ ch 3 .
fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ four of them were civilians who didn &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t take part in the fighting , and 25 were under 18 years of age .
on a recent trip through the middle east , i attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis .
one of my visits was to s@@ der@@ ot , a community of about 20@@ ,000 in southern isra@@ el that is frequently struck by ru@@ di@@ mentary ro@@ ckets fi@@ red from nearby ga@@ za .
i condemned these attacks as ab@@ omin@@ able and an act of terrorism , since most of the thir@@ teen victims during the past seven years have been non-@@ comb@@ at@@ ants .
subsequently , i met with leaders of ham@@ as , both a delegation from ga@@ za and the top officials in dam@@ as@@ cus , sy@@ ria .
i made the same condem@@ nation to them , and urged that they declare a unilateral ceas@@ e@@ fire or or@@ chest@@ rate with isra@@ el a mutual agreement to termin@@ ate all military action in and around ga@@ za for an extended period .
they responded that such previous action by them had not been reciproc@@ ated , and they reminded me that ham@@ as had previously insisted on a ceas@@ e@@ fire throughout pal@@ est@@ ine including both ga@@ za and the west bank , which isra@@ el had refused .
ham@@ as then made a public proposal of a mutual ceas@@ e@@ fire restricted to ga@@ za , which the isra@@ eli@@ s considered and also rejected .
there are fer@@ vent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the hol@@ y land .
isra@@ el has occupied and colon@@ ized the pal@@ est@@ inian west bank , which is approximately one-@@ fourth ( 28.@@ 5 % ) the size of the nation of isra@@ el as recognized by the international community .
some isra@@ eli religious fac@@ tions claim a right to the land on both sides of the jord@@ an river , and others a@@ ver that their 20@@ 5 settlements with some 500@@ ,000 people are necessary for “ security . ”
all ar@@ ab nations have agreed to full recognition of isra@@ el if it will comply with key united nations resolutions .
ham@@ as has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between pal@@ est@@ inian authority president mah@@ m@@ oud ab@@ bas and isra@@ eli prime minister eh@@ ud ol@@ m@@ ert , provided it is approved in a referendum among the pal@@ est@@ inian people .
this holds promise of progress , but despite the brief fan@@ fare and positive statements at the peace conference last nov@@ ember in ann@@ a@@ polis , mar@@ y@@ land , a retro@@ gres@@ sion has occurred in the process .
nine thousand new isra@@ eli settlement housing units have been announced in pal@@ est@@ ine , the number of road@@ blocks within the west bank has increased , and the stran@@ gle@@ hold on ga@@ za has been tigh@@ tened .
it is one thing for other leaders to de@@ fer to the us on the crucial peace negotiations , but the world must not stand id@@ le while innocent people are treated cru@@ el@@ ly .
it is time for strong voices in europ@@ e , the us , isra@@ el , and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the pal@@ est@@ inian people .
ch@@ ic@@ ago – the world ’ s first “ qu@@ ant@@ um ” computer – a machine that har@@ nesses the magic of qu@@ ant@@ um phenomena to perform memory and processing tasks incredibly faster than today ’ s sili@@ con@@ -based computer chips – was recently sold by d-@@ wave systems of can@@ ada to lock@@ he@@ ed-@@ mar@@ tin .
and , while some question whether the machine is truly a qu@@ ant@@ um computer , its designers have published articles in pe@@ er-@@ reviewed journ@@ als demonstrating that the basic elements of this novel computer are indeed super@@ conducting qu@@ ant@@ um bits .
this spring marked the 100@@ th anniversary of the discovery of super@@ conduc@@ tivity – the ability of materials to carry electrical current with no loss .
curr@@ ents set up in super@@ conducting wi@@ res can exist for years without any meas@@ ur@@ able dec@@ ay .
because of this property , super@@ conduc@@ tors have unique features that can be exploited in many ways .
they can carry enormous amounts of current , making them ideal for urban power gri@@ ds .
and , when wo@@ und into co@@ ils , they can produce extremely strong magnetic fields .
such super@@ conducting magne@@ ts have been applied in a variety of technologies .
the best-@@ known examples are the magne@@ ts that drive the magnetic res@@ on@@ ance ima@@ ging ( m@@ ri ) machines found in most hospitals .
perhaps the most exotic are the huge magne@@ ts used to accelerate parti@@ cles in the large ha@@ dr@@ on col@@ li@@ der , which seeks to discover the fundamental principles of matter .
despite their great promise , however , super@@ conduc@@ tors have limits , the primary one being that most super@@ conduct at very low temperatures – indeed , near absolute zero ( -@@ 27@@ 3 º@@ c ) .
such temperatures can be achieved only through liqui@@ d-@@ he@@ li@@ um cooling .
thus , s@@ wis@@ s researchers caused exc@@ itement in 1986 by announ@@ cing the discovery of super@@ conduc@@ tivity in an o@@ xide of copper at twice the temperature of the previous record holder .
shortly there@@ after , researchers in the united states found a related material that super@@ conduc@@ ts above the temperature at which air liqu@@ e@@ fies .
as time magazine proc@@ laimed in may 1987 , with the discovery of these so-called “ cu@@ pr@@ ates , ” the super@@ conducting revolution had begun .
al@@ as , the revolution soon bo@@ gged down .
cu@@ pr@@ ates are not@@ ori@@ ously difficult materials to work with , because they are very b@@ rit@@ tle .
this is exacerb@@ ated by their strong an@@ iso@@ trop@@ y – the materials have a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ two-@@ dimensional structure consisting of a weak@@ ly coupled st@@ ack of conducting sheets .
as such , they are a challenge for industry , though applications are beginning to appear .
since the cu@@ pr@@ ates first appeared , a variety of other “ high temperature ” super@@ conduc@@ tors have been discovered – one is a simple compo@@ und of mag@@ n@@ esi@@ um and bor@@ on , and another involves a mixture of iron and ar@@ sen@@ ic .
although none of them super@@ conduct at temperatures as high as liquid air , they may ultimately be better materials with which to work .
given the vast number of combin@@ ations of elements that can form compo@@ unds , there is a good chance that better super@@ conduc@@ tors await our discovery .
in the coming years , super@@ conduc@@ tors are expected to play a growing role in technology .
already , “ second generation ” cu@@ pr@@ ate wi@@ res are being used to make high-@@ capacity c@@ ables for electri@@ c-@@ power transmission , and ligh@@ ter-@@ weight gener@@ ators for wind tur@@ bin@@ es .
stronger super@@ conducting magne@@ ts are leading to the development of m@@ ris with more sophisticated diagno@@ stic capabilities .
the discovery of a new super@@ conduc@@ tor with enhanced properties could lead to even greater technological innovation .
this brings us to the intellectual challenge of super@@ conduc@@ tors .
it took 46 years from the discovery of super@@ conduc@@ tivity to the 1957 bar@@ de@@ en , co@@ op@@ er , and schri@@ eff@@ er ( b@@ cs ) theory of how the phenomenon occurs .
along the way , a number of famous physi@@ c@@ ists tried and failed to get the answer – al@@ bert ein@@ stein , wer@@ ner he@@ is@@ enberg , and rich@@ ard fe@@ yn@@ man being notable examples .
dis@@ covering the solution required the development of advanced theoretical techniques .
what had been difficult to figure out was how to get elec@@ tr@@ ons to super@@ conduct .
the basic discovery of b@@ cs was that if the elec@@ tr@@ ons pair up , those couples could indeed super@@ conduct .
fortunately , the mechanism for such cou@@ pling was known .
although elec@@ tr@@ ons are neg@@ atively charged , and therefore rep@@ el one another , the positive i@@ ons that they leave behind when they flow through a metal can medi@@ ate an effective attraction between two elec@@ tr@@ ons under restrictive conditions ( for example , the metal must be very cold ) .
the suspici@@ on , though , is that this is not the case in the new super@@ conduc@@ tors .
cu@@ pr@@ ates super@@ conduct at much higher temperatures , but , more importantly , they possess some exotic properties : they are formed by d@@ oping electrical carriers into a host material that is a magnetic insu@@ lat@@ or – the last place one would look for a conventional super@@ conduc@@ tor .
and , unlike b@@ cs theory , in which the pa@@ irs are iso@@ trop@@ ic – with identical properties in all directions in space – the pa@@ irs in cu@@ pr@@ ates are strongly an@@ iso@@ trop@@ ic , resem@@ bling a clo@@ ver@@ lea@@ f .
how can one pair elec@@ tr@@ ons without i@@ ons holding them together , thereby enabling hig@@ her@@ -@@ temperature super@@ conduc@@ tors ?
while ideas about this abo@@ und , new theoretical break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s most likely will be needed to develop the machinery required to solve such elec@@ tr@@ on-@@ elec@@ tr@@ on the@@ ories , perhaps even involving black holes .
whatever the theory turns out to be , it is certain to revolution@@ ize physi@@ cs .
lies , dam@@ ned lies , and ai
cam@@ bridge – algorith@@ ms are as bi@@ ased as the data they feed on .
and all data are bi@@ ased .
even “ official ” statistics cannot be assumed to stand for objective , e@@ ternal “ facts . ”
the figures that governments publish represent society as it is now , through the lens of what those assem@@ bling the data consider to be relevant and important .
the categories and classi@@ fications used to make sense of the data are not neutral .
just as we measure what we see , so we tend to see only what we measure .
as algorith@@ mic decision-making spre@@ ads to a wider range of policy@@ making areas , it is sh@@ ed@@ ding a har@@ sh light on the social bi@@ ases that once l@@ ur@@ ked in the sha@@ dows of the data we collect .
by taking existing structures and processes to their logical extre@@ mes , artificial intelligence ( ai ) is forcing us to confront the kind of society we have created .
the problem is not just that computers are designed to think like corporations , as my university of cam@@ bridge colleague j@@ onn@@ ie pen@@ n has argued .
it is also that computers think like economists .
an ai , after all , is as in@@ fal@@ li@@ ble a version of hom@@ o econom@@ ic@@ us as one can imagine .
it is a ration@@ ally calcul@@ ating , lo@@ gi@@ cally consistent , end@@ s-@@ oriented agent capable of achieving its desired outcomes with fin@@ ite comp@@ ut@@ ational resources .
when it comes to “ maxim@@ izing utility , ” they are far more effective than any human .
“ utility ” is to economics what “ ph@@ log@@ ist@@ on ” once was to chem@@ istry .
early chem@@ ists hypo@@ thes@@ ized that comb@@ usti@@ ble matter contained a hidden element – ph@@ log@@ ist@@ on – that could explain why substances changed form when they bur@@ ned .
yet , try as they might , scientists never could confirm the hypo@@ thesis .
they could not track down ph@@ log@@ ist@@ on for the same reason that economists today cannot offer a measure of actual utility .
economists use the concept of utility to explain why people make the choices they do – what to buy , where to invest , how hard to work : everyone is trying to maxim@@ ize utility in accordance with one ’ s preferences and belie@@ fs about the world , and within the limits posed by scar@@ ce income or resources .
despite not existing , utility is a powerful construct .
it seems only natural to sup@@ pose that everyone is trying to do as well as they can for themselves .
moreover , economists ’ notion of utility is born of classical uti@@ lit@@ ari@@ anism , which aims to secure the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people . like modern economists following in the foot@@ steps of j@@ oh@@ n stu@@ art mill , most of those designing algorith@@ ms are uti@@ lit@@ ari@@ ans who believe that if a “ good ” is known , then it can be maxim@@ ized .
but this assumption can produce troub@@ ling outcomes .
for example , consider how algorith@@ ms are being used to decide whether prisoners are deser@@ ving of par@@ ole .
an important 2017 study finds that algorith@@ ms far out@@ perform humans in predic@@ ting reci@@ di@@ vis@@ m rates , and could be used to reduce the “ j@@ ailing rate ” by more than 40 % “ with no increase in crime rates . ”
in the united states , then , ais could be used to reduce a prison population that is dis@@ proportion@@ ately black .
but what happens when ais take over the par@@ ole process and afri@@ can@@ -@@ ameri@@ cans are still being j@@ ailed at a higher rate than wh@@ ites ?
highly efficient algorith@@ mic decision-making has brought such questions to the fore , forcing us to decide precisely which outcomes should be maxim@@ ized .
do we want merely to reduce the overall prison population , or should we also be concerned about fairness ?
whereas politics allows for fu@@ dges and compromises to dis@@ gu@@ ise such trade@@ off@@ s , computer code requires clarity .
that demand for clarity is making it harder to ignore the structural sources of soci@@ etal in@@ equi@@ ties .
in the age of ai , algorith@@ ms will force us to recognize how the outcomes of past social and political conflicts have been perpet@@ u@@ ated into the present through our use of data .
thanks to groups such as the ai ethics initiative and the partnership on ai , a broader debate about the ethics of ai has begun to emerge .
but ai algorith@@ ms are of course just doing what they are co@@ ded to do .
the real issue extends beyond the use of algorith@@ mic decision-making in corporate and political governance , and strikes at the ethical foundations of our societies .
while we certainly need to debate the practical and philosoph@@ ical trade@@ off@@ s of maxim@@ izing “ utility ” through ai , we also need to engage in self-@@ reflection .
algorith@@ ms are posing fundamental questions about how we have organized social , political , and economic relations to date .
we now must decide if we really want to en@@ code current social arrangements into the decision-making structures of the future .
given the political fra@@ c@@ turing currently occurring around the world , this seems like a good moment to write a new script .
a better global framework to end aids
stock@@ hol@@ m , gen@@ eva – this week , we celebrate the tremendous progress that has been made in the struggle against hi@@ v and aids .
in many countries with strong health systems , hi@@ v is no longer a death sentence , but a chronic condition .
and afri@@ ca has reached a critical milestone : each year , there are now more afri@@ cans starting hi@@ v treatment than being infected .
still , even as we celebrate , we must also mo@@ ur@@ n the 1.1 million people who lost their lives to the disease this year .
hi@@ v still infec@@ ts 6@@ ,000 people every day , and aids remains a leading cause of death among children , ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents , and women in afri@@ ca .
the movement against aids has inspired all of us to help the people who continue to be left behind , and to commit to ending aids once and for all .
fortunately , we already have the know-how , resources , and , cru@@ cially , the political momentum to do this ; and at the high-level meeting on ending aids this year , united nations member states made ambitious commitments that will put us on the fast track toward our goal .
what ’ s more , in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber , can@@ ada hosted a successful financing conference for the global fund to fight aids , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , and malaria , which brought in almost $ 13 billion , re@@ plen@@ ishing the global fund for 201@@ 7-@@ 201@@ 9 .
mean@@ while , individual countries have increased their domestic investments , and international partners – big and small – have maintained their support , which is how we will reach the $ 26 billion needed for the global aids response in 2020 .
but funding parts of the global health system is not enough .
the international community must take a more hol@@ istic view and reinforce a glob@@ al-@@ response architecture that features a clear division of labor and se@@ am@@ less cooperation among various stakeholders .
ultimately , the goal of such a framework must be to support countries ’ own health systems , by mar@@ shal@@ ing public and private actors at all levels in a given country , so that every facility – from the public hospital in the capital to the village clin@@ ic – is properly provisi@@ oned .
s@@ weden is proud to continue its support for the global fund ; at the re@@ plen@@ ishment conference in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber , it ple@@ dged 2.5 billion k@@ ron@@ a ( $ 27@@ 1 million ) .
the global fund is by far the largest multilateral source of financing for efforts to fight aids , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , and malaria ; but just like the global alliance for vacc@@ ines and imm@@ uni@@ zation ( now known as g@@ av@@ i , the vacc@@ ine alliance ) , it is part of a global architecture , and re@@ lies on a range of partners to deliver aid effectively .
so , if countr@@ y-@@ level support for other glob@@ al-@@ health organizations – such as un@@ aids , the world health organization , and the un development programme – dri@@ es up , continued progress in the fight against hi@@ v and aids will be at risk .
providing the necessary support will require donors to coordinate with one another , so that all parts of the existing architecture for managing global health issues are adequately funded .
this will then ensure that all countries – and , more importantly , all people – receive the support they need .
un@@ aids is setting a powerful example for international collaboration , by organizing partners around a common 201@@ 6-@@ 20@@ 21 strategy to end aids .
this unique and innovative partnership brings together 11 co-@@ spon@@ sor@@ ing un agencies , each with diverse sec@@ tor@@ -@@ specific expertise , and mobili@@ zes various government stakeholders .
partners include business , community , and faith leaders , as well as teachers , judges , members of law enforcement , parlia@@ mentari@@ ans , and many others outside the health sector whose actions nonetheless affect health outcomes .
one of un@@ aids ’ tasks is to encourage national governments to keep aids high on their public-@@ health agen@@ das , and to invest in joint efforts to end the disease .
it is also the only organization with a mandate to set norms and standards for the global response to aids , which means that it plays a key role in the current international framework .
un@@ aids maintains a close partnership with the global fund . it has a presence in more than 80 countries , and its regional teams provide technical support and strategic information , which helps the global fund direct its grants to the right programs , locations , and populations at sufficient scale .
moreover , it helps to create the social , legal , and political conditions for people to use health services , not least by promoting gender equality and ensuring that populations at higher risk of contracting hi@@ v do not face adverse discrimination .
un@@ aids eng@@ ages with civil society at all levels , by le@@ ver@@ aging the international aids response to promote equality , dignity , and human rights around the world .
as such , un@@ aids works to expand the political space for – and investment in – civil society .
yet , despite its broad mandate and many functions , un@@ aids lacks adequate resources , which threat@@ ens past achievements and future programs alike , and poses a danger to people and communities that depend on the li@@ fes@@ aving support the organization helps facilitate .
s@@ weden and un@@ aids will work together to ensure that the international aids response continues to transform – and save – lives .
we will safeguard and em@@ power women and girls , and make sure that vulnerable populations ’ voices are heard .
but , at the same time , the international community must strengthen the existing framework for managing glob@@ al-@@ health issues .
as swe@@ dish prime minister ste@@ fan lö@@ f@@ ven said in mon@@ tre@@ al in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber : “ today we are focusing on the global fund , but tomorrow let ’ s not forget to provide sufficient funding for the entire global health architecture . ”
it is time for the international community to meet that challenge , by ple@@ dging to support our global health infrastructure , so that no agency – and no country or person – is left out .
aids , n@@ c@@ ds , and the ab@@ cs of organizing
gen@@ eva – non-@@ communic@@ able diseases ( n@@ c@@ ds ) , like heart disease , stro@@ ke , cancer , di@@ abetes , and chronic lung disease , are responsible for 70 % of all deaths .
there is in@@ contro@@ verti@@ ble evidence that tobacco use , in@@ activity , un@@ healthy di@@ ets , and excessive alcohol consumption increase the od@@ ds of dying pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely from an n@@ c@@ d .
and yet , despite widespread knowledge of the risks , global o@@ bes@@ ity goes largely un@@ checked , while tobacco and alcohol use continue to rise .
it is against this backdrop that networks of n@@ c@@ d al@@ liances met dec@@ ember 9-@@ 11 at the second global n@@ c@@ d alliance forum , in the united ar@@ ab em@@ ir@@ ates .
as they search for solutions to bring n@@ c@@ ds under control , they should look for inspiration to the movement to fight aids .
people living with and affected by hi@@ v continue to drive response efforts , and their unique form of mobili@@ zation has been instru@@ mental to progress .
while the battle is not over , aids activists know that it can be won .
simil@@ arly , a mobili@@ zed n@@ c@@ d movement can turn the ti@@ de against that epide@@ mic .
yet , in 2015 , rich@@ ard hor@@ ton , the editor of the lan@@ c@@ et , described the n@@ c@@ d community as nee@@ ding an “ electric shock to its semi-@@ com@@ at@@ ose soul . ”
he added : “ but who has the courage to deliver it ? ”
we believe there are lessons to be learned from aids activists .
as global attention focuses on n@@ c@@ d prevention , those seeking to control prev@@ ent@@ able ill@@ nesses should look to the “ ab@@ cs ” of aids organizing for guidance .
the first letter that the n@@ c@@ d community should consider is “ a , ” for activis@@ m .
anyone over 40 will recall images of aids activists performing “ di@@ e-@@ ins ” at scientific meetings around the world .
in the united states , aids activists took to the streets , even sh@@ utting down the food and drug administration ’ s headquarters for a day in oc@@ tober 1988 .
globally , activists lob@@ bi@@ ed governments and pharmaceutical companies to make medicines more affordable .
this activis@@ m continues , and should serve as a model for action on n@@ c@@ ds .
next , the n@@ c@@ d community must adopt a b@@ older approach to budgets – the “ b ” of the aids movement ’ s strategy .
civi@@ c organizing and grass@@ roots activis@@ m may fuel early energies , but organizing and su@@ sta@@ ining a broad@@ -based coalition takes money .
the aids movement was clear about this from the beginning , and lob@@ bi@@ ed for resources to support its advoc@@ acy and accountability effectively .
“ c ” is for co@@ ali@@ tions : the aids movement was quick to understand that progress would come only with diverse support .
activists established links between people living with hi@@ v and those with other concerns , such as women ’ s rights , intellectual property , nutrition , and housing .
issu@@ e-@@ specific co@@ ali@@ tions and campaigns work best when they bring together government in@@ si@@ ders and out@@ si@@ ders , to combine perspectives and expertise .
the aids movement also understood that a hol@@ istic response to the epide@@ mic was essential .
thus , “ d , ” the underlying determin@@ ants of health , was to draw attention to the inter@@ connec@@ tivity of the drivers of challenge .
for example , lob@@ b@@ ying education leaders to keep girls in school longer has contributed to providing young people with the knowledge and agency to make smart decisions about when and with whom to negotiate safe sex .
simil@@ arly , links were for@@ ged between groups working on poverty , gender , and nutrition – factors that played a role in driving the aids crisis .
n@@ c@@ ds are no less isolated in their caus@@ ality , and simil@@ arly require a multi-@@ sector approach to prevention .
engagement – “ e ” – was what helped the aids movement become so influ@@ ential .
by borro@@ wing from the play@@ book of the disability rights movement , which champi@@ oned the man@@ tra “ nothing about us without us , ” aids advocates demanded representation on the bodies established to address the disease .
for example , un@@ aids remains the only united nations agency with seats on its board for representatives from civil society .
this nor@@ m is so power@@ fully embedded in the aids movement that it would be almost un@@ thin@@ k@@ able for an aids meeting to take place without representation from the community .
disease prevention movements must also develop persu@@ a@@ sive nar@@ rati@@ ves , and “ f ” – fra@@ ming the issue – was essential to the aids community ’ s effort to gain support from political leaders .
in particular , access to aids treatment was fra@@ med as a matter of economic justice .
fra@@ ming the nar@@ r@@ ative this way led to a dramatic reduction in the price of medicines , so much so that more than half of people living with hi@@ v in low@@ - and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries are in treatment .
an equally important fra@@ ming issue for aids , which is highly relevant to the n@@ c@@ ds movement , is that of responsibility .
the aids community worked hard to shift the focus from bl@@ aming individuals ’ lifestyle choices to putting the on@@ us on the state for providing health care and removing legal discrimination .
in the aids debate , gender – our movement ’ s “ g ” – was a significant fo@@ cal point .
hi@@ v was initially seen as a “ ga@@ y disease , ” and gender identity was embedded in the d@@ na of the aids movement early on .
gender dimensions of n@@ c@@ ds are no less important ; one only has to consider how alcohol and tobacco are mark@@ eted to understand that .
gender , therefore , must become a focus of n@@ c@@ ds prevention efforts .
finally , “ h ” – human rights – was the bed@@ rock of the aids response .
campaigns were launched against discrimination in work@@ places , schools , and health centers .
strategic liti@@ gation helped ensure equality under the law .
the aids movement refused to hold major conferences in countries with p@@ uni@@ tive laws against people living with hi@@ v .
the n@@ c@@ d movement could take a similar t@@ ack by , for example , ref@@ using to meet in countries that fail to restrict advertising of jun@@ k food to children .
the list of aids lessons could continue throughout the alpha@@ bet , but ending with “ h ” is ap@@ t , given that human rights dro@@ ve the response , and should drive the response to n@@ c@@ ds .
poverty , exclusion , and social and economic margin@@ alization put people at higher risk for hi@@ v .
it is no different for n@@ c@@ ds .
the early main@@ stream reaction to the aids epide@@ mic was to ask , “ why don ’ t those people make better choices ? ” the aids movement made clear that that was the wrong question .
today , with 70 % of the planet at risk of pre@@ mature death from prev@@ ent@@ able ill@@ nesses , “ those people ” are many of us .
the n@@ c@@ d and aids communities can learn from one another .
we are a stronger movement when we join forces .
the views expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of un@@ aids .
aid works
new y@@ or@@ k – the critics of foreign aid are wrong .
a growing flood of data shows that death rates in many poor countries are falling sharp@@ ly , and that ai@@ d-@@ supported programs for heal@@ th-@@ care delivery have played a key role .
aid works ; it sa@@ ves lives .
one of the newest studies , by gab@@ ri@@ el dem@@ om@@ b@@ yn@@ es and so@@ fia tro@@ mm@@ ler@@ ova , shows that ken@@ ya ’ s inf@@ ant mortality ( deaths under the age of one year ) has pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed in recent years , and attri@@ butes a significant part of the gain to the massive up@@ take of anti-@@ malaria bed nets .
these findings are consistent with an important study of malaria death rates by ch@@ ris mur@@ ray and others , which simil@@ arly found a significant and rapid decline in mal@@ ari@@ a-@@ caused deaths after 2004 in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca resulting from ai@@ d-@@ supported mal@@ ari@@ a-@@ control measures .
let ’ s turn back the clock a do@@ zen years .
in 2000 , afri@@ ca was strug@@ gling with three major epide@@ m@@ ics .
aids was killing more than two million people each year , and spreading rapidly .
malaria was sur@@ ging , owing to the par@@ as@@ ite ’ s growing resistance to the standard medicine at the time .
tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis was also so@@ aring , partly as a result of the aids epide@@ mic and partly because of the emergence of dru@@ g-@@ resistant t@@ b .
in addition , hundreds of thousands of women were dying in child@@ birth each year , because they had no access to safe deliveries in a clin@@ ic or hospital , or to emergency help when needed .
these inter@@ connected crises promp@@ ted action .
the united nations ’ member states adopted the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals in se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 2000 .
three of the eight m@@ d@@ gs – reductions in children ’ s deaths , mat@@ ern@@ al deaths , and epide@@ mic diseases – focus directly on health .
likewise , the world health organization issued a major call to scale up development assistance for health .
and afri@@ can leaders , led by ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s president at the time , ol@@ use@@ gun ob@@ as@@ an@@ jo , took on the challenge of batt@@ ling the continent ’ s epide@@ m@@ ics .
ni@@ geri@@ a hosted two land@@ mark summ@@ its , on malaria in 2000 and on aids in 2001 , which were a crucial sp@@ ur to action .
at the second of these summ@@ its , th@@ en-@@ un sec@@ retary-@@ general ko@@ fi ann@@ an called for the creation of the global fund to fight aids , t@@ b , and malaria .
the global fund began operations in 2002 , financing prevention , treatment , and care programs for the three diseases .
high-@@ income countries also finally agreed to reduce the debt o@@ wed by heavily in@@ deb@@ ted poor countries , allowing them to spend more on health care and less on crip@@ pling payments to credi@@ tors .
the united states also took action , adopting two major programs , one to fight aids and the other to fight malaria .
in 2005 , the un mill@@ enni@@ um project recommended specific ways to scale up primary health care in the poorest countries , with the high-@@ income countries helping to cover the costs that the poorest could not pay by themselves .
the un general assembly backed many of the project ’ s recommendations , which were then implemented in numerous low-@@ income countries .
donor aid did start to rise sharp@@ ly as a result of all of these efforts .
in 1995 , total aid for health care was around $ 7.@@ 9 billion .
this inadequate level then cre@@ pt up slowly , to $ 10.@@ 5 billion by 2000 .
the expanded funding allowed major campaigns against aids , t@@ b , and malaria ; a major sc@@ aling up of safe child@@ birth ; and increased vacc@@ ine coverage , including the near@@ -@@ eradication of poli@@ o .
many innovative public-@@ health techniques were developed and adopted .
with one billion people living in high-@@ income countries , total aid in 2010 amoun@@ ted to around $ 27 per person in the donor countries – a modest sum for them , but a life-@@ saving one for the world ’ s poorest people .
the public-@@ health successes can now be seen on many fron@@ ts .
around 12 million children under five years old died in 1990 .
by 2010 , this number had declined to around 7.@@ 6 million – still far too high , but definitely an historic improvement .
malaria deaths in children in afri@@ ca were cut from a peak of around one million in 2004 to around 7@@ 00@@ ,000 by 2010 , and , worldwide , deaths of pregn@@ ant women declined by almost half between 1990 and 2010 , from an estimated 54@@ 3@@ ,000 to 28@@ 7@@ ,000 .
another $ 10-@@ 15 billion in annual aid ( that is , roughly $ 10-@@ 15 more per person in the high-@@ income world ) , bringing total aid to around $ 40 billion per year , would enable still greater progress to be made in the coming years .
the m@@ d@@ gs for health could be achieved even in many of the world ’ s poorest countries .
unfortunately , at every step during the past decade – and still today – a ch@@ or@@ us of aid skep@@ tics has argued against the needed help .
they have repeatedly claimed that aid does not work ; that the funds will simply be wa@@ sted ; that anti-@@ malaria bed nets cannot be given to the poor , since the poor won ’ t use them ; that the poor will not take anti-@@ aids medicines properly ; and so on and so forth .
their attacks have been rel@@ ent@@ less ( i ’ ve faced my share ) .
the opponents of aid are not merely wrong .
their vocal ant@@ agon@@ ism still threat@@ ens the funding that is needed to get the job done , to cut child and mat@@ ern@@ al deaths by enough to meet the m@@ d@@ gs by 2015 in the poorest countries , and to continue after that to ensure that all people everywhere finally have access to basic health services .
a decade of significant progress in health outcomes has proved the skep@@ tics wrong .
aid for health care works – and works magnific@@ ently – to save and improve lives .
let us continue to support these life-@@ saving programs , which uphold the dignity and well-being of all people on the planet .
the da@@ wn of cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ friendly air travel
mon@@ tre@@ al – as the world becomes increasingly inter@@ connected , demand for air travel is growing , with more than 30@@ ,000 new large aircraft expected to take to the sk@@ ies in the next few years .
but if we are to sustain growth in air travel without ag@@ grav@@ ating global warming , we must quickly reduce avi@@ ation-@@ related co@@ 2 emissions , which are substantial and not covered by the par@@ is climate agreement that more than 190 countries agreed to last dec@@ ember .
fortunately , now is the perfect time to dec@@ ou@@ ple aviation emissions from air-@@ travel growth .
representatives from 19@@ 1 countries conven@@ ed in mon@@ tre@@ al this week for the 39@@ th session of the united nations ’ international civil aviation organization ; after decades of w@@ ran@@ gling , they have agreed to an avi@@ ation-@@ specific climate agreement .
the new ic@@ ao framework aims for “ car@@ b@@ on-@@ neutral growth ” in international aviation from 2020 on@@ ward , and has as its c@@ enter@@ piece a global market-@@ based measure ( g@@ mb@@ m ) to help airlines afford@@ ably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels .
when implemented , it will be the first car@@ b@@ on-@@ emissions cap on a global industry that does not notic@@ e@@ ably increase costs for consumers .
and airlines will purchase emissions reductions from other economic sectors , thus fun@@ n@@ eling billions of dollars into low-@@ carbon development around the world .
for the first six years , the new framework will apply only to flights between countries that have volun@@ tar@@ ily adopted it , which means that the ic@@ ao will have to encourage adequate participation for the program to be effective .
this op@@ t-in approach has some critics , but whether a program is categ@@ ori@@ zed as “ voluntary ” or “ mandatory ” is beside the point , because international acc@@ ords generally apply only to the sovereign countries that have decided to join them .
some 64 countries have already sign@@ aled their willingness to sign on to the ic@@ ao agreement , and together they account for nearly 80 % of expected growth in co@@ 2 emissions above 2020 levels .
that isn ’ t 100 % , but it ’ s a great start , and we can expect more countries to join when they see others re@@ ap@@ ing the benefits of low-@@ carbon development .
the airlines themselves will welcome a coherent global framework that establishes clear and predictable compliance met@@ rics , rather than a regulatory pat@@ ch@@ work that diff@@ ers from country to country and complic@@ ates international operations .
to minim@@ ize compliance costs – and because environmental sustainability is now a key competitive mark@@ er for customers and investors alike – airlines will likely encourage the countries where they do business to participate in the ic@@ ao program .
the new agreement provides an enormous opportunity to prevent the emission of 2.5 billion tons of co@@ 2 in the first 15 years – the equivalent of taking roughly 35 million cars off the road every year the program is in force .
the agreement will also sp@@ ur major manufacturers such as bo@@ eing , air@@ bus , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , and embra@@ er – which are already investing in qui@@ eter , more fu@@ el-@@ efficient aircraft and efficiency improvements for existing models – to develop clean@@ er technologies that will allow them to purchase fewer emissions off@@ sets .
however , the framework decided in mon@@ tre@@ al is not complete , and crucial details need to be worked out quickly so that airlines can begin to plan how they will meet the new environmental targets .
developed countries have already offered to help implement the g@@ mb@@ m , which , it is hoped , will pa@@ ve the way for investments in emerging economies that are becoming new aviation power@@ houses .
if the countries can le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g over old technologies , they can become new leaders in car@@ b@@ on-@@ smart flying .
they should sei@@ ze the opportunity before them and join the ic@@ ao framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward .
at the par@@ is climate talks last year , we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change .
no fewer than 18@@ 7 countries – large and small , developed and developing – announced emis@@ sion@@ s-@@ reduction targets in the months before the conference , which created the momentum to reach a land@@ mark acc@@ ord .
with the par@@ is climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months – more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible – we still have that momentum .
the ic@@ ao agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change .
together , the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth .
by cleaning up our carbon foot@@ print now , future generations of air travel@@ ers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet .
sin@@ ga@@ por@@ e – europ@@ ean policymakers like to lec@@ ture the rest of the world on air pollution .
a@@ sia , and ch@@ ina in particular , is a favorite target for criticism .
indeed , it sometimes seems as if no major environmental conference is complete without a presentation by europ@@ ean policymakers on their continent ’ s supposed “ best practices , ” which the rest of the world should em@@ ul@@ ate .
when it comes to air pollution , however , europ@@ e might consider doing less talking and more listening .
air pollution is a growing concern across europ@@ e .
the world health organization has called it the continent ’ s “ single largest environmental health risk , ” estim@@ ating that 90 % of europ@@ e ’ s citizens are exposed to outdoor pollution that exceeds who air-@@ quality guidelines .
in 2010 , some 600@@ ,000 europ@@ ean citizens died pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely because of outdoor and indoor air pollution , and the economic costs have been put at $ 1.6 tril@@ lion , roughly 9 % of the europ@@ ean union ’ s g@@ d@@ p .
lon@@ don and par@@ is suffer from particularly severe air-@@ quality problems .
nit@@ ro@@ gen dioxide levels in some parts of lon@@ don regularly reach 2-@@ 3 times the recommended limit .
in the united king@@ dom , air pollution k@@ ills some 29@@ ,000 people a year , putting it second only to smoking as a cause of pre@@ mature death .
par@@ is may be even worse off ; in mar@@ ch , after air-@@ pollution levels sur@@ passed sh@@ ang@@ hai ’ s , the city imposed a partial driving ban and introduced free public transportation .
sad@@ ly , europ@@ e ’ s policymakers do not seem up to the challenge .
ge@@ or@@ ge os@@ borne , the uk ’ s chan@@ cell@@ or of the ex@@ ch@@ equ@@ er , has argued against bri@@ tish leadership in the fight against climate change . “ we are not going to save the planet by sh@@ utting down our steel m@@ ills , al@@ umin@@ um sm@@ el@@ ters , and paper manufacturers , ” he declared in 2011 .
os@@ borne is not alone .
with europ@@ ean politicians argu@@ ing that introducing environmental safeguards will h@@ urt the eu ’ s al@@ read@@ y-@@ weak@@ ened economy , it comes as little surprise that measures to limit air pollution fall far short of the mark .
the eu ’ s proposed standards regulating toxic emissions from coal plants are even less strict than ch@@ ina ’ s , gre@@ en@@ peace reports .
yet various europ@@ ean politicians have called for water@@ ing them down even further , with hung@@ ary sugge@@ sting that they be scra@@ pped altogether .
to be sure , air pollution levels in a@@ sia are truly wor@@ ris@@ ome .
the continent is home to nine of the world ’ s ten most poll@@ uted countries , according to y@@ ale university ’ s 2014 air quality ranking .
new del@@ hi is ran@@ ked as the most poll@@ uted city on earth , with air pollution exceeding safe levels by a factor of 60 .
owing to bei@@ jing ’ s un@@ healthy air , foreign companies pay a “ hard@@ ship bonus ” of up to 30 % to employees working there .
but at least policymakers in a@@ sia have recognized the problem and are taking steps to address it .
ch@@ ina , for example , has declared a “ war on pollution . ”
by 2017 , bei@@ jing – once du@@ b@@ bed “ gre@@ y@@ jing ” by the international media – will spend some c@@ n ¥ 7@@ 60 billion ( $ 12@@ 1 billion ) to combat air pollution .
at the heart of ch@@ ina ’ s measures are improved public transportation , green trade , and a revision of the energy mix .
the government has decided to install bus stops every 500 meters in city centers , reduce tariffs to 5 % or less for a list of 54 environmental goods , and dec@@ ommission many out@@ dated and in@@ efficient coal plants .
the share of non-@@ fossil fuels in primary energy consumption is expected to increase to 20 % by 2030 .
these targets are likely to be rigor@@ ously implemented , given strong political support from the very top .
mean@@ while , in indi@@ a , the state governments in gu@@ jar@@ at , ma@@ har@@ ash@@ tra , and tam@@ il n@@ ad@@ u are about to launch the world ’ s first cap@@ -@@ and-@@ trade schemes for particul@@ ates .
indi@@ a ’ s su@@ preme court even suggested an extra charge on priv@@ ately owned diesel vehicles in new del@@ hi .
other parts of a@@ sia are also taking steps to improve air quality .
vi@@ et@@ nam aims to construct eight urban rail lines in the coming years .
b@@ ang@@ kok , which has been tackling air pollution since the 1990s , has plan@@ ted 400@@ ,000 trees .
and jap@@ an is offering subsidies for hydro@@ gen cars and creating new pedestri@@ an-@@ only areas .
europ@@ e , as one of the world ’ s weal@@ thi@@ est regions , ought to be at the fore@@ front of the effort to promote environmental sustainability .
when it comes to air pollution , however , europ@@ e ’ s policymakers should stop pre@@ aching to others and focus on fixing their own problems .
a jap@@ anese met@@ am@@ or@@ pho@@ sis ?
o@@ sa@@ ka – yesterday ’ s lands@@ li@@ de gener@@ al-@@ election victory by the democratic party of jap@@ an ( d@@ p@@ j ) termin@@ ated the one-@@ part@@ y-@@ dominated system that the cat@@ ch-@@ all liberal democratic party ( ld@@ p ) has controlled almost without inter@@ ruption since 195@@ 5 .
for most of the last decade , the d@@ p@@ j was not seen as a viable alternative to the ld@@ p , although they appeared to form a p@@ seu@@ do-@@ two-@@ party system .
twenty years after the cold war ’ s end , jap@@ an will at last have a post-@@ cold war system of government .
the jap@@ anese public , even now , remains uncertain about the d@@ p@@ j ’ s ability to go@@ vern and is skep@@ tical of its ro@@ sy programs of wealth re@@ distribution , which lack solid funding .
the public is also fully aware that the ide@@ ologically frag@@ mented d@@ p@@ j lacks a pragmatic , coherent foreign and security policy
yet the d@@ p@@ j will form the next government because of public dis@@ g@@ ust with the ld@@ p .
for the last four years , the ld@@ p had shown itself to be utter@@ ly un@@ respon@@ sive to the key issues of popular concern : pensions , unemployment , and the fra@@ ying social safety net .
moreover , the ld@@ p was pla@@ gu@@ ed by a string of minor sc@@ and@@ als and consistent b@@ ung@@ ling .
the ld@@ p ’ s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party ’ s power nu@@ cle@@ us had mel@@ ted down .
once in power , the d@@ p@@ j will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entr@@ en@@ ched mand@@ ar@@ ins , which usually s@@ abo@@ tage any efforts at administrative reform that threat@@ ens their power and vest@@ ed interests .
indeed , immediately after the election , the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due .
the figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process , in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with ld@@ p .
so , without breaking the regular budget cycle , the d@@ p@@ j will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the ld@@ p , but will also be stu@@ ck with next year ’ s budget , which em@@ bodies ld@@ p policies that the d@@ p@@ j has den@@ ounced .
as a result , the d@@ p@@ j has announced plans to re@@ vo@@ ke the ld@@ p ’ s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formul@@ ate its own budget from scrat@@ ch . it will also re@@ vise the supplementary budget as well .
but time is short , and few of new d@@ p@@ j law@@ makers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen .
to gain control of the mand@@ ar@@ ins , the d@@ p@@ j plans to place 100 law@@ makers in the min@@ istri@@ es ’ top leadership , as well as three do@@ zen political appoin@@ tees to policy sta@@ ffs in the office of the prime minister .
unfortunately , the d@@ p@@ j scra@@ pped an ld@@ p-@@ spon@@ sored civil@@ -@@ service reform bill , which would have allowed the d@@ p@@ j to replace mand@@ ar@@ ins with an army of political appoin@@ tees .
the d@@ p@@ j , despite its manifest@@ o , seems un@@ prepared to t@@ ame the mand@@ ar@@ ins , and so may be forced to rely on them .
the as@@ cen@@ den@@ cy of the mand@@ ar@@ ins is a legacy of jap@@ an ’ s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period .
unlike in europ@@ e , jap@@ an developed its state before building a strong civil society .
indeed , full-@@ fle@@ dged “ society ” -@@ building started only after the 18@@ 68 mei@@ ji restoration , which ti@@ pped the balance of power defini@@ tively in favor of the state .
as a result , the mand@@ ar@@ ins survi@@ ved w@@ wi@@ i and the post@@ war ameri@@ can occupation relatively und@@ am@@ aged , and they will strive to survive the d@@ p@@ j government as well .
they will most likely succeed .
ld@@ p law@@ makers and mand@@ ar@@ ins developed a routine in which mand@@ ar@@ ins drafted cab@@ in@@ et-@@ spon@@ sored bil@@ ls , ld@@ p law@@ makers checked the bil@@ ls , and the two together fin@@ alized legislative dra@@ fts before they were introduced to the diet ( parliament ) .
since the ld@@ p , recently with a coalition partner , controlled the diet , the legislative process was simply the interaction between ld@@ p law@@ makers and mand@@ ar@@ ins , c@@ entered in the ld@@ p ’ s headquarters .
the diet ’ s role was merely pro form@@ a .
indeed , under the ld@@ p-@@ led one-@@ part@@ y-@@ dominant system , this extra@@ -@@ constitutional mechanism became an integral part of jap@@ an ’ s government pol@@ ity .
the d@@ p@@ j government will col@@ li@@ de head@@ -@@ on with the mand@@ ar@@ ins , partly because the party will find it hard to recru@@ it sufficiently qualified policymakers .
the mand@@ ar@@ ins have maintained their privileged position in this regard , owing partly to the tax system , which prevents the emergence of non-@@ profit institutions , especially think tanks , where independent policy expertise can be for@@ ged .
moreover , perhaps in anticip@@ ation of a change in power , the mand@@ ar@@ ins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major min@@ istri@@ es ’ top administrative positions .
and what of the ld@@ p ?
having fallen from power , it will lose its control of the re@@ distribution of government funds .
unable to pay off its constitu@@ encies , dis@@ integration lo@@ oms , for the ld@@ p has never been a party with entr@@ en@@ ched grass@@ -@@ roots support , but instead operates as a machine of power and re@@ distribution through a web of in@@ si@@ ders across the country ’ s industrial sectors , occupational associations , and local communities .
only by recru@@ iting new blood and re@@ organizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an ld@@ p com@@ eb@@ ack be possible .
the d@@ p@@ j has even weaker grass@@ -@@ roots support , so the mand@@ ar@@ ins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to ca@@ j@@ ole the party by teaching it to m@@ im@@ ic the ld@@ p in using state money and contracts to under@@ write its major constitu@@ encies , such as labor unions and other interest groups .
the birth of the d@@ p@@ j government can yet be a turning point .
a major power shift in favor of “ society ” has taken place .
if the d@@ p@@ j can break free of mand@@ arin control by centr@@ alizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister , as it intends , jap@@ an can emerge as a more re@@ sili@@ ent democracy with a full-@@ fle@@ dged two-@@ party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role .
a job@@ less recovery ?
cam@@ bridge – who will suffer the lon@@ gest and the most from the imp@@ lo@@ sion in 2008-@@ 2009 of wall street and the ensu@@ ing world recession ?
not the ban@@ kers and finan@@ ci@@ ers who created the disaster .
some finan@@ ci@@ ers , like ber@@ n@@ ard ma@@ do@@ ff , will go to prison for fraud .
but , although ma@@ do@@ ff was only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg of ra@@ mp@@ ant financial mal@@ fe@@ as@@ ance , most suspect finan@@ ci@@ ers need not fear arrest , either because their behavior merely sk@@ ir@@ ted the law , or because financial impro@@ pri@@ ety more sub@@ tle than ou@@ tri@@ ght fraud is often difficult to prove .
some bank bo@@ ss@@ es will reti@@ re in shame , but with huge payments to ease their pain – such as the $ 55 million golden par@@ ach@@ ute handed to bank of ameri@@ ca ’ s ken le@@ wis , with his , and the £ 25 million pension be@@ sto@@ wed on ro@@ yal bank of sco@@ t@@ land ’ s fred go@@ d@@ win .
but , bu@@ o@@ yed by government ba@@ il@@ out money , guarantees , and low interest rates , many banks have again begun to pay their top managers huge bon@@ uses while fighting vigor@@ ously against reforms designed to restra@@ in their ris@@ k-@@ taking and compensation .
the big lo@@ sers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the la@@ isse@@ z-@@ faire flexibility of ameri@@ can@@ -@@ style capitalism .
from 2007 to oc@@ tober 2009 , the united states lost nearly eight million jobs , which reduced the emplo@@ y@@ ment-@@ population ratio from 63 % to 5@@ 8.@@ 5 % .
the unemployment rate at the end of 2009 was above 10 % , duration of job@@ less@@ ness was the lon@@ gest since the great de@@ pression , millions had had their working hours cut , and millions more were too dis@@ cour@@ aged by a lack of jobs to seek work .
advanced europ@@ e , can@@ ada , and jap@@ an also suffered major job losses that will last for a long time .
sp@@ ain , which allows for widespread temporary contracts , has had the biggest increase in unemployment , because span@@ ish workers can be fi@@ red as quickly as those in the us .
some countries – for example , ger@@ many , s@@ weden , and south korea – have “ hidden ” their job@@ less@@ ness by paying firms to keep workers on the pay@@ roll .
this can work in the short term , but it cannot be sustained over time .
from the 1980 ’ s through the mid-@@ 2000 ’ s , employment has increasingly lag@@ ged g@@ d@@ p in economic recover@@ ies .
in the us , there was a job@@ less recovery under president bill clin@@ ton until the do@@ t@@ .com boom in the latter part of the 1990 ’ s , and there was a job@@ less recovery under ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush in the wake of the 2001 slow@@ down .
in the early 1990 ’ s , s@@ weden suffered a huge recession pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated by a housing bub@@ ble and a banking crisis .
its unemployment rate rose from 1.@@ 8 % in 1990 to 9.@@ 6 % in 1994 , before bot@@ tom@@ ing out at 5 % in 2001 .
six@@ teen years after the crisis , the unemployment rate was 6.@@ 2 % – more than tri@@ ple the rate in 1990 .
in 1997 , korea suffered not only from the asi@@ an financial crisis , but also from insist@@ ence by the us and the international monetary fund that it raise interest rates and undertake “ wash@@ ington consensus ” -@@ style reforms to receive aid .
employment recovered , but primarily in “ non-@@ regular ” jobs with limited benefits , low wages , and little job security .
inequality in korea rose from moderate levels to second highest ( behind the us ) among advanced o@@ ec@@ d countries .
weakness in the job market takes a huge toll on economic and personal well-being .
young people seeking their first jobs and experienced workers who lose jobs in a weak job market suffer economic losses that will last their entire lives .
studies of happ@@ iness show that unemployment reduces happ@@ iness by as much as the loss of a family member .
it is difficult to see the us re-@@ at@@ taining full employment any@@ time soon .
from 1993 to 1998 , the us created millions of jobs , which raised the employment rate by 5.@@ 4 percentage points .
if employment began rising at this rate in 2010 , it would take until 2015 before it reached its pre-@@ recession level .
and slow recovery in the us will drag down recovery in other advanced countries , reducing their employment as well .
a long , painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible us economic model would ever produce .
from the early 1990 ’ s on , many an@@ al@@ yst@@ s viewed ameri@@ ca ’ s weak uni@@ on@@ ization , at-@@ will employment , limited legal job protection , and high job turnover as major factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most eu countries .
many o@@ ec@@ d countries initiated various kinds of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along us lines .
the view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer ten@@ able .
in its 2009 employment outlook , the o@@ ec@@ d took a hard look at its favo@@ red policy reforms and found them defici@@ ent in helping countries adjust to a finan@@ ce-@@ driven recession .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d , “ there does not appear to be any strong reason to expect that recent structural reforms mean that o@@ ec@@ d labor markets are now substantially less sensitive to severe economic down@@ turns . ”
so the lesson from the recession is clear .
the weak re@@ ed in capitalism is not the labor market , but the financial market .
at worst , lab@@ or-@@ market failures impose modest in@@ efficiency costs on society , whereas capital@@ -@@ market failures harm society greatly , with workers , rather than the perpet@@ r@@ ators of financial disaster , suffering the most .
moreover , globalization means that the us capital market ’ s failure spre@@ ads mis@@ ery around the world .
we o@@ we it to workers vic@@ tim@@ ized by this recession to re@@ inv@@ ent finance so that it works to en@@ rich the real economy , instead of enrich@@ ing only the finan@@ ci@@ ers .
this means changing the incentives and rules that go@@ vern the financial sector .
since other countries ’ economies and jobs are also at stake , they o@@ we it to their citizens to press the us to deliver meaningful financial reforms .
par@@ is – bas@@ til@@ le day , the f@@ ren@@ ch national holiday , was gl@@ orious this year .
the military par@@ ade , dominated by the celebration of “ victory ” in mal@@ i and the joint participation of afri@@ can and united nations troops , had the perfec@@ tion of a gra@@ cious , albeit mus@@ cular , b@@ allet .
the classical concert that prece@@ ded the mag@@ ister@@ ial fire@@ works that ended the day was the closest thing to a f@@ ren@@ ch version of the pro@@ ms in lon@@ don , mix@@ ing light classical and popular songs .
the ei@@ ff@@ el tower im@@ bu@@ ed the evening with its magic .
par@@ is , in case anyone had any ling@@ ering doubts , remains the capital of the world – or so it seemed for a night .
the mel@@ an@@ cho@@ lia that began to sei@@ ze fran@@ ce many years ago was all but forgotten .
the celebration of the gl@@ ory of the past , mixed with popular english songs of the present , seemed to indicate renewed national confidence .
was it purely the product of a collective del@@ u@@ sion , an emotional po@@ tem@@ kin village of sorts , encouraged , if not conceived , by the authorities to restore some level of self-@@ assurance among fran@@ ce ’ s de@@ pressed citizens ?
even if the positive emo@@ tions remain only fle@@ eting ( as seems most likely ) , they were real and pal@@ p@@ able .
of course , it could simply have been the weather ; a gor@@ ge@@ ous summer has finally settled in after a mis@@ er@@ able spring .
but it might also have been one of those natural turning points , a collective and spon@@ tane@@ ous decision to say : “ enough of de@@ pression , let ’ s move on . ” we f@@ ren@@ ch may not be what we used to be , the celeb@@ rants seemed to be saying , but we are still much more than people think we are .
we have a great revolutionary past that still conve@@ ys universal values – liberty , equality , fr@@ at@@ ernity – and an army that , as in mal@@ i , continues to make a difference in the world .
one can draw two lessons from this collective form of escap@@ ism .
the first is that , beyond the many layers of de@@ pression and dist@@ r@@ ust in fran@@ ce , there is potential for a new and collective departure .
this would require , of course , less cy@@ ni@@ cal political el@@ ites who can trans@@ c@@ end their pet@@ ty ambitions and divisions for the sake of the country .
the second lesson , even more obvious , is that reality cannot be changed with a simple public spectac@@ le .
fran@@ ce is not imperi@@ al ro@@ me , where pan@@ em et cir@@ c@@ enses made a fundamental difference .
it is a weak@@ ened democracy mi@@ red in an economic and social crisis so deep that it ver@@ ges on becoming an identity crisis .
the proof was provided by a third traditional event on bas@@ til@@ le day , between the morning ’ s military par@@ ade and the evening ’ s music and fire@@ works : president fran@@ ç@@ ois hol@@ lan@@ de ’ s speech to the nation , which took the form of an interview with two prominent journalists .
he , too , was in a re@@ ass@@ uring mood .
according to hol@@ lan@@ de , the economic up@@ turn – la re@@ prise – had just started , and hope was around the corner .
his tone and message had changed .
he was no longer the “ normal man ” of his election campaign and ten@@ ure until now ; instead , he tried to present himself , like his predec@@ essor , ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy , as a super@@ her@@ o .
of course , given his personality and low public-@@ approval rat@@ ings , his address was the least convincing event of the day .
who could have said with certainty that the economic up@@ turn announced by hol@@ lan@@ de was real rather than aspir@@ ational ?
beyond his message ’ s w@@ ish@@ ful thinking , the public ’ s reaction to the m@@ essenger was a mixture of dis@@ belief and in@@ difference .
seeing the behavior of friends , all f@@ ren@@ ch , listening with me to hol@@ lan@@ de , i was reminded of another moment .
it was dec@@ ember 31 , 1989 , and i was in the so@@ vi@@ et union . i had found myself in a restaurant in the old city of su@@ z@@ dal , listening to president mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il gor@@ b@@ ach@@ e@@ v ’ s “ new year wishes . ”
i was moved : the man who symbo@@ li@@ zed glas@@ no@@ st and per@@ est@@ ro@@ ika , who had allowed the peaceful eman@@ cip@@ ation of most of eastern and central europ@@ e , was speaking .
but i was alone in paying attention to him .
the restaurant ’ s customers , like my f@@ ren@@ ch friends now , could not have c@@ ared less .
their president had become background noise .
has hol@@ lan@@ de become , in this sense , a f@@ ren@@ ch gor@@ b@@ ach@@ e@@ v ?
for the left and the gre@@ ens , he is close to being a tra@@ it@@ or .
these voters chose him a year ago not only because he was not s@@ arko@@ zy , but because he inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ated the values of the true left , even if his centr@@ ist moder@@ ation seemed a bad omen .
voters of the center or even the c@@ enter@@ -@@ right are disappointed , too , by their president ’ s lack of char@@ is@@ ma , if not she@@ er in@@ competence .
after a year of hol@@ lan@@ de , fran@@ ce is witness@@ ing a fundamental political revolution .
during the half-@@ century of the fifth re@@ public , a bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an system of left and right has traditionally prev@@ ailed .
but now fran@@ ce is becoming a country dominated by a “ tri@@ parti@@ te system ” of more or less equal strength : the left , the right , and the extreme right .
if fran@@ ce wants to cap@@ itali@@ ze on the positive emo@@ tions of bas@@ til@@ le day , it needs much more responsible el@@ ites , ready to unite in the fight against unemployment and its causes ( lack of competitiveness and lab@@ or-@@ market rigi@@ dity ) and consequences ( the rise of popul@@ ist , non-@@ re@@ publi@@ can forces ) .
what bas@@ til@@ le day revealed , even briefly and super@@ fici@@ ally , is that the potential to unite fran@@ ce exists .
but doing so requires more than shal@@ low promises .
a ki@@ ck-@@ off for peace ?
y@@ er@@ ev@@ an – ar@@ men@@ ian president ser@@ z@@ h sar@@ g@@ sy@@ an ’ s recent invitation to tur@@ k@@ ish president ab@@ dul@@ lah gu@@ l to visit y@@ er@@ ev@@ an to watch a football match together was historic .
given the two countries ’ long-@@ stra@@ ined relations , this visit would have been remarkable at any time .
but coming as it does only one month after the alarming rus@@ si@@ an-@@ ge@@ or@@ gian confron@@ tation , it may offer real hope that tensions in the vol@@ atile cau@@ casus region can be e@@ ased .
of course , ancient and difficult issues divide ar@@ men@@ ia and tur@@ key .
but now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns .
in the new context set by the war in ge@@ or@@ gia , the urgency of tur@@ key becoming a real bridge between the nations of the cau@@ casus is not lost on anyone .
this expec@@ tation is an inevitable consequence of tur@@ key ’ s geograph@@ y and history .
situated figur@@ atively between modern@@ ity and tradition , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism and is@@ lam , and democracy and ty@@ ran@@ ny , tur@@ key also is an actual physical bridge between east and west .
for the peoples of the cau@@ casus , tur@@ key marks our path to europ@@ e .
it is a nat@@ o member , bor@@ dering the three cau@@ casus re@@ public@@ s that have nat@@ o individual partnership action programs .
it as@@ pi@@ res to join the europ@@ ean union , and would bring the eu to our three borders , even as we , too , asp@@ ire to join one day .
indeed , tur@@ key has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional bro@@ ker .
immediately after the collapse of the so@@ vi@@ et union , tur@@ key proposed the black sea economic cooperation .
this year , as the ameri@@ can@@ -@@ led effort to medi@@ ate a middle east peace settlement began to fal@@ ter , tur@@ key took up the job of medi@@ ator in both the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ pal@@ est@@ inian conflict and the conflict between sy@@ ria and isra@@ el .
now , in the immediate wake of the rus@@ si@@ a-@@ ge@@ or@@ gia crisis , tur@@ key ’ s leaders have step@@ ped forward once again to take a leadership role in the cau@@ casus .
the world must fer@@ v@@ ently hope that the tur@@ k@@ ish proposal for a cau@@ casus stability and cooperation platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts .
but , in order to succeed , tur@@ key must firmly pursue a ple@@ dge from all the region ’ s players to re@@ pu@@ di@@ ate the use of force in sett@@ ling their disputes .
if this ple@@ dge is adopted and respected , conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different , more toler@@ ant context , marking a historic break@@ through to peace .
in fact , why not take the idea of such a pact one step further ?
we in this region can , and i believe should , call for a non-@@ align@@ ed cau@@ casus , free of security b@@ loc@@ s and ad@@ vers@@ ari@@ al al@@ liances .
after all , security al@@ liances and guarantees only create divi@@ ding lines , with their atten@@ dant security challenges .
our countries and peoples have , throughout history , lived under a common umbrel@@ la for far longer than we have been divided .
today , we share a common vision of europ@@ ean integration , and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved .
f@@ ren@@ ch president ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy ’ s and german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a merk@@ el ’ s visits to ge@@ or@@ gia and rus@@ sia proved that there is no substitute for europ@@ e in@@ sofar as the cau@@ casus is concerned .
only europ@@ e can play the role of honest bro@@ ker in the region ’ s atmosphere of suspici@@ on and in@@ tolerance .
but , at the end of the day , we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation .
the cau@@ casus is too small a space for closed borders and explo@@ sive conflicts .
although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral , the ge@@ or@@ gi@@ an-@@ rus@@ sian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this glob@@ alized world , and certainly not in this inter@@ connected region .
in fact , real peace in the cau@@ casus requires two key strategic transform@@ ations .
one is a lesson from history : rus@@ sia ’ s strategic interests here cannot be ignored .
the other lesson is that tur@@ key and ar@@ men@@ ia cannot remain ad@@ vers@@ aries forever .
there must be norm@@ alization in our relations in order for the cau@@ casus to co@@ al@@ es@@ ce into a functional region .
ir@@ on@@ ically , both rus@@ sia and the united states recognize that this is in their interest .
the rus@@ si@@ ans view normal relations between tur@@ key and ar@@ men@@ ia as a way to minim@@ ize ge@@ or@@ gia ’ s strategic role in the region .
the us views an opening to tur@@ key as a way to decrease ar@@ men@@ ia ’ s real and imagin@@ ed reli@@ ance on rus@@ sia .
beyond the emotional impact of president gu@@ l ’ s visit to y@@ er@@ ev@@ an , real improvement in tur@@ k@@ ish-@@ ar@@ men@@ ian relations requires opening the two countries ’ closed border – the last in europ@@ e .
or , for a start , the existing rail@@ road link between the two countries could be made operational .
if this does not happen within the coming weeks and months , then tur@@ key will have demonstrated that all this was just a show .
president gu@@ l ’ s visit does mark a water@@ shed – either as a failure to make history , or as the beginning of a new era .
al@@ an gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an on trial
the release of al@@ an gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an ’ s g@@ host@@ written mem@@ o@@ irs the age of tur@@ bul@@ ence has e@@ lic@@ ited charges that he was not such a great central ban@@ ker after all .
stan coll@@ ender of national journ@@ al sees the finger@@ prints of the white house on these attacks : gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an is har@@ sh@@ ly critical of ge@@ or@@ ge w. b@@ ush ’ s administration , after all , and to attack the credibility of re@@ publi@@ can ex-@@ policymakers who are critical of b@@ ush is standard counter@@ pun@@ ching for it .
but what is one to make of the critic@@ isms of gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an ’ s ten@@ ure at the federal reserve ?
the indic@@ tment contains four counts : that gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an wron@@ g@@ ly che@@ ered the growth of non-@@ standard adju@@ stab@@ le-@@ rate mort@@ g@@ ages , which fu@@ eled the housing bub@@ ble ; that he wron@@ g@@ ly endorsed b@@ ush ’ s tax cuts ; that he should have re@@ ined in the stock market bub@@ ble of the 1990 ’ s ; and that he should have done the same with the real estate bub@@ ble of the 2000 ’ s .
to the first two counts , gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an now ple@@ ads guilty .
he says that he did not understand how the growth of non-@@ standard mort@@ g@@ ages had lu@@ red borro@@ wers and investors into bearing dangerous risks .
he was , he now says , focusing on how fix@@ ed-@@ rate mort@@ g@@ ages are relatively bad deals for borro@@ wers in times of low inflation , which was a mistake .
gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an also ple@@ ads guilty to a mistake in early 2001 .
he thought that he was giving balanced testi@@ mon@@ y to congress on government budget issues .
he testi@@ fied that it is important to run sur@@ pl@@ uses to pay down the debt , but that sur@@ pl@@ uses must not be so large that the government win@@ ds up own@@ ing ameri@@ can industry .
he also testi@@ fied that tax cuts are better than spending increases to keep sur@@ pl@@ uses from growing too large , but that uncertainty is enormous , so that any tax cuts should be can@@ cel@@ ed if they threatened to bring us back to an age of deficits .
ro@@ bert ru@@ bin and k@@ ent con@@ rad warned him that the press would not interpre@@ t his testi@@ mon@@ y as being balanced , and that congress would interpre@@ t it as an excuse to abandon fiscal discipline .
they were right .
gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an also ple@@ ads guilty to mis@@ understanding the character of the b@@ ush administration .
he thought that his old real@@ ity-@@ based friends from the ford administration were back in power . he thought that he – and treas@@ ury secret@@ ary pau@@ l o ’ nei@@ ll – could win the quiet “ inside game ” for sensible policy without res@@ or@@ ting to an “ outside game ” that would make his re@@ appointment in 2004 unlikely .
he was wrong .
but how serious are these polic@@ y-@@ political crimes to which gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an now ple@@ ads guilty ?
in my view , they are mis@@ de@@ mean@@ ors .
against them you have to set what former treas@@ ury secret@@ ary lar@@ ry summ@@ ers calls gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an ’ s “ golden g@@ love ” performance at avoiding and minim@@ izing rec@@ essions during his years at the fed .
the “ fel@@ on@@ ies ” of which gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an stands accused are the other two charges : that he should have done more to stop the stock market bub@@ ble of the late 1990 ’ s , and that he should have done more to stop the housing bub@@ ble of the early 2000 ’ s .
here , gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an holds his ground , and ple@@ ads not guilty .
the only way , he says , for the fed to have kept stock prices in reasonable equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um ranges in the late 1990 ’ s would have been to raise interest rates so high that they hit the real economy on the head with a bri@@ ck .
interest rates high enough to cur@@ b stock market speculation would also have cur@@ bed construction and other forms of investment , raised unemployment , and sent the economy into recession .
to cause a significant current evil in order to avoid a possible future danger when our knowledge is limited and our judgments uncertain is , gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an believes , un@@ wise .
in this , he is following a tradition of cau@@ tion that extends from ed@@ mund bur@@ ke to j@@ oh@@ n ma@@ yn@@ ard ke@@ yn@@ es .
gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an moun@@ ts a similar defense concerning the housing bub@@ ble .
high construction employment has been good for ameri@@ can workers in the past half-@@ decade – a period that has not produced much good for them .
higher interest rates to reduce the housing boom seem , even in retro@@ spec@@ t , ill advised if the cost is mass unemployment .
and gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an es@@ che@@ ws pat@@ ern@@ alism : he would not assume the role of a regul@@ ator telling people that they cannot buy a house even though a l@@ ender is willing to finance it .
but gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an would have served the country and the world better if he had been somewhat more pat@@ ern@@ alist in s@@ lowing the growth of non-@@ standard adju@@ stab@@ le-@@ rate mort@@ g@@ ages .
he would have served the country and the world better had he been less of a lo@@ yal re@@ publi@@ can working the inside game of trying to convince b@@ ush ’ s political advis@@ ors that good policy was important , and more of a non@@ parti@@ s@@ an ste@@ ward of ameri@@ ca ’ s long-term fiscal stability .
of course , such a gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an would never have been re-@@ appointed .
all in all , gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an served the united states and the world well through his ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship of monetary policy , especially by what he did not do : trying to stop stock and housing speculation by hal@@ ting the economy in its tracks .
a lasting po@@ ison
new y@@ or@@ k – next year will mark the twen@@ tieth anniversary of the collapse of commun@@ ism in europ@@ e .
liber@@ ated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cru@@ el past , the young people of eastern europ@@ e ’ s post-@@ communist generation seem un@@ interested in what their parents and grand@@ parents endu@@ red .
yet the recent re@@ vel@@ ation of the cz@@ ech writer mil@@ an k@@ under@@ a ’ s presu@@ med complic@@ ity in the face of stal@@ in@@ ism is but the latest of the long half-@@ life of a toxic past .
other examples come to mind : the accus@@ ations of collaboration with the secret police raised against le@@ ch wal@@ esa , roman@@ ia ’ s public controversi@@ es surrounding mir@@ ce@@ a e@@ lia@@ de ’ s fasc@@ ist past , and the attacks on the alleged “ je@@ wish monopoly of suffering ” which equ@@ ate the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st with the so@@ vi@@ et gu@@ lag .
fried@@ rich ni@@ etz@@ sche said that if you look in the eye of the de@@ vil for too long , you risk becoming a de@@ vil yourself .
a bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k anti@@ commun@@ ism , similar in its dog@@ mati@@ s@@ m to commun@@ ism itself , has from time to time run ri@@ ot in parts of eastern europ@@ e .
in country after country , that mani@@ ch@@ ean min@@ d@@ set , with its over@@ simpli@@ fications and manipul@@ ations , was merely re-@@ fashi@@ oned to serve the new people in power .
opport@@ un@@ ism has had its share in this , of course .
in 1945 , when the red army occupied roman@@ ia , the communist party had no more than 1,000 members ; in 1989 , it had almost four million .
one day after ni@@ col@@ ae ce@@ aus@@ esc@@ u ’ s execution , most of these people suddenly became fi@@ erce anti@@ commun@@ ists and victims of the system they had served for decades .
resi@@ dual tra@@ ces of total@@ itarian thinking can also be found in the ho@@ stil@@ ity to former dis@@ siden@@ ts like ad@@ am mi@@ chni@@ k or vá@@ cla@@ v ha@@ vel , both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit res@@ ent@@ ments or seek re@@ ven@@ ge , as the total@@ itarian state did , but instead build a new national consensus to structure and em@@ power a genuine civil society .
former gener@@ als of the secret police and members of the communist nom@@ en@@ kl@@ at@@ ura , un@@ tou@@ ch@@ able in their comfortable villas and reti@@ re@@ ments , must deri@@ ve great pleasure from watching today ’ s wit@@ ch hun@@ ts and manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes .
but the case of k@@ under@@ a appears different – though no less distur@@ bing .
in 1950 , k@@ under@@ a , then a 20-@@ year-old communist , re@@ porte@@ dly den@@ ounced to the criminal police as a western sp@@ y a man he had never met – a friend of his friend ’ s gir@@ l@@ friend .
the man was later brut@@ ally inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated in a former gest@@ ap@@ o torture facility and spent 14 years in prison .
k@@ under@@ a ’ s name was contained in the investig@@ ating officer ’ s report , which was authenti@@ c@@ ated after a respected hist@@ orian discovered it in a du@@ sty pra@@ gue archive .
the rec@@ lu@@ sive k@@ under@@ a , who im@@ mig@@ rated to par@@ is in 1975 , has declared that “ it never happened . ” moreover , cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia ’ s f@@ ear@@ some secret police , who had every interest in si@@ len@@ cing or com@@ promising the famous dis@@ sident writer , never used the incident to black@@ mail or ex@@ pose him .
until more information is forthcoming , both from k@@ under@@ a and from the authorities , the case will not be solved “ beyond reasonable doubt . ”
but if it happened , the case calls for a deeper reflection .
as far as we know , k@@ under@@ a never was an inform@@ er before or after this incident , and we cannot ignore that he later fre@@ ed himself from the compulsory total@@ itarian happ@@ iness that commun@@ ism prop@@ ag@@ ated .
indeed , his case also serves as a remin@@ der that the early 1950 ’ s was the most brutal period of “ pro@@ let@@ arian dictatorship ” in eastern europ@@ e – a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that po@@ is@@ oned the minds and sou@@ ls of devoted belie@@ vers , fi@@ erce opponents , and ap@@ ath@@ etic b@@ yst@@ anders alike .
moreover , k@@ under@@ a ’ s case is hardly unique .
in 2006 , the no@@ bel pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winning german author g@@ ün@@ ter grass ’ s disclos@@ ed that , 60 years earlier , he was , as a te@@ en@@ ager , a member of the waff@@ en-@@ ss .
simil@@ arly , a few years ago , the world was sho@@ cked to learn that famous itali@@ an writer ign@@ a@@ zio sil@@ one had , in his youth , collabor@@ ated with the fasc@@ ist police .
daily life under total@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , be it communist or fasc@@ ist , was rout@@ inely based on a deep dup@@ licity whose effects are long@@ standing .
i don ’ t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episo@@ des in the life of a great writer .
why not ?
we should be interested not for prosec@@ ut@@ orial purposes , but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloo@@ dy , de@@ ma@@ go@@ gical , and ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal ut@@ op@@ ia – and of human weakness and vulnerability . we may even consider it a rewar@@ ding te@@ sta@@ ment to an artist ’ s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce pri@@ cel@@ ess work .
but can we justi@@ fi@@ ably defend mor@@ ally com@@ promised artists and intellec@@ tu@@ als on the basis of their work ’ s mer@@ it , yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave off@@ enses ?
an eg@@ regi@@ ous example of this was the way fol@@ lo@@ wers of roman@@ ian phil@@ osop@@ her const@@ anti@@ n no@@ ica def@@ ended his support for the fasc@@ ist iron guard and his later collaboration with the commun@@ ists , while at the same time condem@@ ning even a generic cleaning woman for m@@ opping the floors in the offices of the secret police .
sh@@ ouldn ’ t that clean@@ er ’ s dru@@ d@@ gery to support her family , children , and her own survival be taken equally into account ?
life under total@@ it@@ ari@@ anism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special , nu@@ anced rules to all the cap@@ tives of that or@@ deal .
in order to understand that e@@ po@@ ch , we have to know and carefully judge often ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances , never simplifying a multi@@ lay@@ ered daily reality for the sake of current political goals .
if nothing else , in order to for@@ give , we have to know what we are for@@ giving .
in eastern europ@@ e today , old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson .
mo@@ ses wander@@ ed with his people in the desert for 40 years , until they had rid themselves of the po@@ ison@@ ous sla@@ ve ment@@ ality .
toward a more reflec@@ tive planet
cam@@ bridge – the last time the atmosphere held as much carbon dioxide as it does today was about three million years ago – a time when sea levels were 10-@@ 30 meters higher than they are now .
climate models have long strug@@ gl@@ ed to dup@@ licate those large fluctu@@ ations in sea levels – until now .
indeed , for the first time , a high-quality model of ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic ice and climate has been able to simul@@ ate these large sw@@ ings .
that is smart science , but it brings devastating news .
the new model shows that mel@@ ting in ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tica alone could increase global sea levels by as much as one meter ( 3.2 feet ) by the end of this century – well above prior estimates .
worse , it suggests that even extraordinary success at cutting emissions would not save the west ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic ice sheet , lo@@ cking in event@@ ual se@@ a-@@ level increases of more than five meters .
as little as one meter could put at risk entire cities , from mi@@ ami to m@@ um@@ bai , and cause enormous economic dis@@ ruption .
we need to turn down the heat – and fast .
to this end , al@@ be@@ do modification – a kind of geo@@ engineering intended to cool the planet by increasing the reflec@@ tivity of the earth ’ s atmosphere – holds tremendous promise .
in@@ jecting synthetic a@@ ero@@ sol@@ s that reflect sun@@ light into the str@@ ato@@ sphere , for example , could help counter the warming caused by greenhouse gases .
the mechanism is similar to wearing a white shir@@ t in the summer : white reflects sun@@ light and co@@ ols what is under@@ ne@@ ath , whereas dark@@ er colors absor@@ b sun@@ light and heat .
to be sure , even in the best-@@ case scenario , solar geo@@ engineering alone could not stabili@@ ze the world ’ s climate .
for that , we must both stop pum@@ ping carbon pollution into the atmosphere and learn how to remove what is already there .
that is why emissions cuts should receive the lion ’ s share of resources devoted to combating climate change .
but , as the recent study shows , emissions cuts alone cannot save the west ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic ice sheet and prevent a dr@@ astic se@@ a-@@ level rise .
if they are pursued in conjunction with moderate al@@ be@@ do modification , however , there is a chance of hal@@ ting rising temperatures , helping to keep the world under 1.5 ° cel@@ si@@ us above pre-@@ industrial levels , the more ambitious target agreed at the par@@ is climate talks last dec@@ ember .
( it should be noted that , given car@@ b@@ on-@@ cycle fe@@ ed@@ backs , such as the th@@ a@@ wing of per@@ ma@@ fro@@ st , there is a chance that the world would face a 1.5 ° c rise , even if emissions were eliminated today . )
most of the world ’ s state-of-the-art climate models have explo@@ red al@@ be@@ do modification , and each of them has found that the process does have the potential to mitig@@ ate climate change .
beyond limiting total warming , it can help to check the rise in peak temperatures , decre@@ asing the risk of destruc@@ tive heat waves .
and it seems to be particularly effective at reducing extreme rain@@ fall , which holds profound implications for minim@@ izing flood damage .
al@@ be@@ do modification remains uncertain and ris@@ ky , owing partly to a de@@ ar@@ th of organized research into the subject .
but there is not a single climate model run that shows that a moderate intervention would make any region worse off overall .
moreover , the large potential up@@ side , measured in tril@@ li@@ ons of dollars , contra@@ sts with low direct costs – in the single-@@ dig@@ it billions for full-@@ scale deployment .
in fact , al@@ be@@ do modification is so cheap that direct costs will not be the deciding issue .
instead , it is a ris@@ k-@@ risk tra@@ de-@@ off – one that will require more research to assess .
given the lack of knowledge , no sensible person would push for deplo@@ ying al@@ be@@ do modification today .
but it would make no sense to ignore its potential .
after all , no one would argue that we should abandon research on a promising cancer drug because it is un@@ proven .
the us national ac@@ ade@@ my of sciences first called attention to what it then described as “ climate modification ” in a 1983 report .
it recommended careful research in 1992 and again in 2015 .
major environmental groups such as the environmental defense fund and the natural resources defense council support careful , small-@@ scale research .
yet no such program exists .
one reason for this is concern about the di@@ version of resources from other approaches .
but the us , for example , has an annual climate science budget of around $ 3 billion .
an expl@@ or@@ atory solar geo@@ engineering program , co@@ sting only a few tens of millions of dollars per year , is entirely feasible .
a larger obstacle to progress is fear that more attention to geo@@ engineering solutions would sa@@ p motivation to cut emissions .
maybe so , but it would be bark@@ ing mad to take up smoking simply because an experimental cancer treatment showed some promise on a la@@ b rat .
and , in fact , it is conc@@ ei@@ vable that a concer@@ ted effort to advance research on al@@ be@@ do modification could sp@@ ur action to cut emissions , much like a graphic look at the side effects of chem@@ o@@ therapy promp@@ ts some to stop smoking .
wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever reaction prev@@ ails , the moral imperative to explore a technology that can protect the poorest and most vulnerable this century would seem to tru@@ mp am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous concerns that doing so could weak@@ en the incentive to pursue solutions that would largely benefit future generations .
ch@@ ina has initiated a limited research program on al@@ be@@ do modification .
the us has not .
given that al@@ be@@ do modification is the kind of technology that nec@@ es@@ sit@@ ates an open , transparent , and international research effort – precisely the kind of effort in which the us exc@@ els – this is a serious failing .
the us government should take the lead now in resear@@ ching al@@ be@@ do modification .
even if the result was that al@@ be@@ do modification does not work , the divi@@ den@@ ds of such research would be enormous , owing to the added pressure to cut emissions .
and if it turned out to be successful , the social , environmental , and economic returns would be tremendous .
a le@@ ague of democracies ?
lon@@ don – sen@@ ator j@@ oh@@ n m@@ cc@@ ain , the re@@ publi@@ can presidential candidate , has been calling for the creation of a “ le@@ ague of democracies . ”
this new international group would possess a form@@ id@@ able military capacity , based partly on nat@@ o and partly on a “ new qu@@ ad@@ ri@@ lateral security partnership ” in the p@@ aci@@ fic between au@@ str@@ alia , indi@@ a , jap@@ an , and the us .
neither rus@@ sia nor ch@@ ina , of course , would be invited to join : indeed , m@@ cc@@ ain wants to exclude rus@@ sia from the g@@ 8 .
the le@@ ague is necessary , argu@@ es m@@ cc@@ ain , because in matters vital to the us , such as fighting islam@@ ic terrorism , humanitarian intervention , and spreading liberty , democracy , and free markets , the us and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the united nations ( i.e. , from rus@@ sia and ch@@ ina ) .
in other words , the le@@ ague ’ s main purpose is to margin@@ alize rus@@ sia and ch@@ ina in world affairs .
the most dam@@ ning criticism of m@@ cc@@ ain ’ s plan is that it would launch a new cold war between states lab@@ eled democracies and auto@@ cra@@ cies .
this is not only dangerous , but in@@ coherent .
rus@@ sia and ch@@ ina do not “ threaten ” the “ free world ” with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces , as they did during the cold war .
moreover , the world ’ s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with islam@@ ic terrorism or genocide in dar@@ fur : it was fran@@ ce , after all , which led the opposition in the un security council to the us invasion of i@@ ra@@ q .
moreover , on issues like terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and climate change , the us needs rus@@ sian and chin@@ ese help .
sti@@ g@@ mati@@ zing rus@@ sia and ch@@ ina as par@@ i@@ ah@@ s will not get them on board .
( ch@@ ina must learn to be@@ have “ respon@@ sibly , ” m@@ cc@@ ain decla@@ res with breath@@ -@@ taking con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion . ) in fact , rus@@ sia has mostly co@@ operated with the us in the “ war against terrorism . ”
finally , the idea is im@@ practic@@ able .
one cannot imagine indi@@ a or bra@@ zi@@ l wanting to be part of any such a combination .
so we would all spare ourselves an aw@@ ful lot of trouble if m@@ cc@@ ain ’ s bra@@ in@@ child were bur@@ ied as quickly as possible .
yet underlying this idea is a serious pro@@ position , to which b@@ rit@@ ain ’ s former prime minister , ton@@ y bla@@ ir , often gave el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent expression : democracies don ’ t fight each other , so if the whole world were democratic , wars would stop .
pre@@ sum@@ ably , m@@ cc@@ ain ’ s le@@ ague of democracies is designed to bring im@@ manu@@ el kan@@ t ’ s dream of perpet@@ ual peace closer to re@@ alization by putting pressure on non-@@ democracies to change their ways , by force if necessary .
leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy blo@@ om have become bloo@@ di@@ ly un@@ stu@@ ck in i@@ ra@@ q and afgh@@ an@@ istan . is it true that democracies never fight each other ?
the affir@@ m@@ ative answer seems to depend on two separate claims .
the first is that democracies have , as a matter of historical record , never fought each other .
this is true of a rather small group of rich countries ( indi@@ a is a partial exception ) , mainly in western europ@@ e and its overseas off@@ shoo@@ ts , since world war ii .
mor@@ o@@ ever , they are “ our kind ” of democracy – constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern western systems , not “ islam@@ ic democracies ” like ir@@ an .
a reasonable gener@@ alization from this rather small sample would be that “ prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other . ”
the second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies .
but is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity , or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy ?
is it democracy that has kept europ@@ e peaceful since 1945 , or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the europ@@ ean nor@@ m ?
the world already has a peac@@ e-@@ maintaining institution .
the un was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together .
members accept the obligation not to use force except in self-@@ defense or unless it is authorized by the security council .
the us is frustr@@ ated by not being able to get its way at the un .
but the un exists to protect all states from law@@ less behavior , including by the us .
by imp@@ lic@@ itly b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing the un , and divi@@ ding the world into two armed camps , the le@@ ague of democracies would increase the danger of war .
the world also already has a pro@@ sper@@ ity-@@ spreading mechanism .
it is called trade .
in 1994 , the world trade organization was created to liber@@ alize trade under agreed rules .
it is full of f@@ aults , which need to be corrected . but we don ’ t need a le@@ ague of democracies to do this .
by sub@@ jecting trade relations to embar@@ goes , sanctions , and tests of democracy , environmental standards , and human rights , the le@@ ague is likely to ret@@ ard the growth of trade , and thus the chance for poor non-@@ democracies to catch up .
the only purpose of the le@@ ague of democracies seems to be to legitim@@ ize war@@ -@@ making by democracies – in order to spread democracy !
this is the thr@@ ust of m@@ cc@@ ain ’ s message .
as he put it , the us was built for a purpose – to serve “ e@@ ternal and universal principles . ”
its go@@ d-@@ given task is to build an “ en@@ during global peace on the foundations of freedom , security , prosperity , and hope . ”
noble rhetoric !
but if that is the le@@ ague ’ s purpose – and i see no other – then it is a danger to peace .
this is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-@@ existence with non-@@ democracies is possible .
it is up to the ch@@ ast@@ ened nations of western europ@@ e , which broadly share ameri@@ can values but have learned something about political pati@@ ence , to rein in the ameri@@ can fant@@ asy of re-@@ making the world in its own image .
i am all for spreading west@@ ern@@ -@@ style democracy , but not at the cost of making the world more war@@ like .
peaceful co@@ existence between different political systems is an at@@ tain@@ able objective , and one to which all the world ’ s major powers can sign up .
assured mutual dependence
lon@@ don – during the cold war , the certainty of “ mutually assured destruction ” ste@@ ered the nuclear arms race away from catastro@@ phe : a w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be att@@ acker would face immediate re@@ tali@@ ation , inevitably ending in both sides ’ anni@@ hil@@ ation .
today , a very different race is taking place – a race for the earth ’ s vital resources , and it threat@@ ens to undermine stability in key regions of the world .
the growing dependence of countries on one another ’ s food , water , and energy requires that the global response to sustainability is taken to the highest political level .
unlike the nuclear arms race of the twen@@ tieth century , the re@@ sourc@@ e-@@ security agenda is not linear .
mutually assured destruction was explicitly acknowledged during the cold war in statements from both sides .
in the race for resources that defines the twenty-@@ first century , no actor is directly or indirectly threatening other players to cur@@ tail food or energy exports , but all bear the system@@ ic risks .
countries have become un@@ avoid@@ ably inter@@ dependent , and climate change , water stress , and the loss of ecological re@@ sili@@ ence all increase the vol@@ atility of this mutual dependence .
in a world of limited and scar@@ ce resources , countries and companies will be forced to make decisions that affect one another ’ s security .
in order to navig@@ ate this inter@@ dependence , the earth security index 2014 , produced by the earth security initiative , shows countries ’ combined vulner@@ abilities that might increase the risk exposure of governments and companies , unless more strategic approaches and sustainable investments are put in place .
the es@@ i identifies four areas of mutual dependence that will likely shape global security in the coming decades :
· cho@@ ke points .
countries ’ growing demand for energy , water , food , and land cannot be satisfied without inc@@ urr@@ ing trade@@ off@@ s among limited available resources .
cho@@ ke points are reached when the available resources are insufficient to satisfy demand .
in ch@@ ina and indi@@ a , for example , this means that in certain regions there may not be enough water in the short term to run co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red thermal power stations and ir@@ rig@@ ate large fields to grow crops .
in ch@@ ina , 60 % of planned co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red power plants will be built in water@@ -@@ stressed regions .
· food .
the growing dependence of many countries on food , water , and energy imports creates new opportunities for trade and investment , but it also ex@@ poses countries to critical vulner@@ abilities .
au@@ str@@ alia , for example , is a large coal expor@@ ter but imports most of its refined fuels and holds just three days of fuel stock@@ pil@@ es . the challenges of mutual dependence are particularly acute with respect to food .
as the es@@ i shows , some countries – including eg@@ yp@@ t , per@@ u , and the united ar@@ ab em@@ ir@@ ates – are heavily dependent on cere@@ al imports from a small number of suppliers .
moreover , grain suppliers ’ exposure to extreme weather may compromise their ability to sustain supplies , with kno@@ ck-@@ on effects for import@@ -@@ dependent countries . in 2010 , for example , rus@@ sia imposed an export ban on whe@@ at , following a severe d@@ rought .
the resulting foo@@ d-@@ price increases are believed to have played a role in eg@@ yp@@ t ’ s revolution .
· telec@@ on@@ nec@@ tions .
anticip@@ ating system@@ ic ecological risks will be increasingly important for sectors such as re@@ insurance and infrastructure investments .
“ telec@@ on@@ nec@@ tions ” refer to weather events that are related to one another over large geographic distances .
they are well known to science but not properly discussed by the industries , investors , and governments whose security depends on environmental stability .
for example , tropical rain@@ forests play a crucial function in maintaining stable weather and rain@@ fall , acting as a “ p@@ ump ” that helps mo@@ ist@@ ure travel between different regions .
de@@ fore@@ station can thus have a dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing effect on weather patterns , amp@@ li@@ fying the frequency and sever@@ ity of extreme events such as floods and d@@ rou@@ ghts .
the resulting li@@ abilities to key industries and the financial sector are clear .
in bra@@ zi@@ l , for example , de@@ fore@@ station in amaz@@ onia has s@@ lowed significantly over the last five years , but bra@@ zi@@ l has already lost more than 11 million hectares of rain@@ forest ; its exposure to extreme weather has also steadily risen , with floods causing $ 4.@@ 7 billion in losses in 2011 alone .
· land productivity bott@@ len@@ ecks : agriculture systems are reaching resource limits , and persistent governance gaps compromise their ability to ensure food security , dig@@ ni@@ fied live@@ li@@ hoods , and ecological ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship .
companies , investors , governments , and communities confront a series of critical barriers to increasing the food availability that the world needs : local populations ’ in@@ secure land ownership ; rec@@ eding water tables , owing to un@@ sustainable extra@@ ction rates ; in@@ efficient use of pollu@@ tion-@@ causing in@@ puts like fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers and pesticides ; the loss of vital eco@@ systems , affecting the re@@ sili@@ ence of food production ; and certain areas ’ in@@ ability to cope with extreme weather .
in some regions of indi@@ a , for example , these issues are playing out in tan@@ dem . in@@ secure land ten@@ ure acts as a dis@@ incentive for small@@ holder farmers to commit to produc@@ tiv@@ ity-@@ enhancing investments ; water extra@@ ction rates are deple@@ ting a@@ qui@@ fers as a result of per@@ mis@@ sive policies ; and food security remains out of reach for millions of people , despite rapid economic growth in urban areas .
countries and companies will increasingly need to invest in sustainable land in order to he@@ dge their resource risks .
in 2015 , global frameworks are due to be agreed to address climate change , coordinate responses to natural disasters , and guide the world ’ s development agenda .
some of these multilateral processes – in particular , those seeking an ambitious global climate agreement – appear to be moving in slow motion and against the grain of geo@@ political interests .
in the past , the case for high-level nuclear governance was urgent and clear , but required processes for creating a common understanding of risks and opportunities across national borders .
successful multilateral responses , like the nuclear non-@@ proliferation treaty , continue to be supported by more flexible global platforms , such as the nuclear threat initiative , based on relationships and trust established outside the box of formal multilater@@ alism .
this year , as world leaders discuss the next generation of sustainability , development , and climate frameworks , they will need to put their security and mutual dependence at the heart of the responses .
here , too , the world will need to create informal platforms that supplement traditional multilater@@ alism .
in particular , the out@@ dated divisions between rich and poor countries and their responsibilities must be revised .
as new powers like ch@@ ina , bra@@ zi@@ l , indi@@ a , and other g-@@ 20 economies bid to reform global governance systems , their vulnerability to resource security must in@@ vigor@@ ate these processes .
only then will the world be on track to improve the security of all .
a less@@ -@@ is-@@ more growth strategy for afri@@ ca
re@@ y@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k – if afri@@ can countries were to adopt only one policy to boost economic growth and improve macroeconomic stability , they should reduce the number of currencies in circulation across the continent as quickly as possible .
doing so would most likely encourage trade , as happened in europ@@ e with the arrival of the euro , and could help contain inflation – which is always good for growth – by imposing international discipline on monetary policy .
the afri@@ can union is now aiming at po@@ oling all the continent ’ s currencies into a single currency by 20@@ 28 .
in the meantime , several regional monetary unions are on the drawing board , in addition to the two monetary unions that already exist , one de j@@ ure and the other de facto .
the second of these unions is composed of les@@ oth@@ o , nam@@ i@@ bia , s@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and , and now zim@@ babwe , all of which use the south afri@@ can r@@ and .
dis@@ regarding zim@@ babwe , a recent and incomplete convert , the 18 countries of the two existing monetary unions have , as intended , benefited from lower inflation than much of the rest of afri@@ ca .
to see why , consider ni@@ geri@@ a .
before independence , ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s legal tender was the bri@@ tish po@@ und .
with the establishment of the central bank of ni@@ geri@@ a in 195@@ 9 , the ni@@ geri@@ an po@@ und was introduced .
back then , one ni@@ geri@@ an po@@ und was equivalent to one bri@@ tish po@@ und .
this arrangement remained int@@ act until 1973 , when ni@@ geri@@ a adopted a new currency , the n@@ air@@ a .
the exchange rate remained unchanged : one n@@ air@@ a was equivalent to one bri@@ tish po@@ und .
the n@@ air@@ a was intended to bol@@ ster the country ‘ s independence by making it possible for the central bank to pursue its own monetary policy .
it was also a matter of national pride .
the thinking behind the new arrangement was that an independent and flexible monetary policy would serve the nation ‘ s interest better than a fixed exchange rate that tied the n@@ air@@ a to the po@@ und .
but the n@@ air@@ a ’ s introduction quickly put an end to par@@ ity with the bri@@ tish po@@ und .
government expenditure exceeded federal revenue , despite rapidly rising foreign@@ -@@ exchange earnings from oil exports after 1970 .
the federal government ’ s budget deficits were financed through foreign and domestic borro@@ wing , and by printing money , which led to inflation and de@@ preci@@ ation of the new currency .
today , it costs 220 n@@ air@@ a to buy one bri@@ tish po@@ und , which implies 15 % annual average de@@ preci@@ ation since 1973 .
this de@@ preci@@ ation would perhaps be justi@@ fiable had ni@@ geri@@ a managed to use easy money to narrow the gap between ordinary ni@@ geri@@ ans ’ standard of living and that of people living in b@@ rit@@ ain .
but that did not happen .
the purchasing power of national income per person in ni@@ geri@@ a is now 50 % lower relative to b@@ rit@@ ain than in 1980 .
in view of this experience , ni@@ geri@@ a now plans to abolish the n@@ air@@ a in favor of joining a monetary union with four or five other west afri@@ can countries ( the g@@ ambi@@ a , gh@@ ana , gu@@ ine@@ a , si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , and perhaps liber@@ ia ) .
but that planned monetary union , until recently envisaged to be launched in 2009 , has now been put on ice .
why ?
the smallest countries show no signs of fear of being sw@@ amp@@ ed by ni@@ geri@@ a , by far the most popul@@ ous country in the group ( accounting for 15@@ 5 million of the six countries ’ 200 million people ) , especially as the new west afri@@ can central bank is to be located in acc@@ ra , the capital of gh@@ ana ( 24 million ) .
others , though , may fear the di@@ lu@@ tion of their sovereignty when the new central bank of the west afri@@ can monetary zone takes over some of the policy@@ making responsibilities of national central banks .
when the west afri@@ can monetary zone finally is established , the number of currencies in afri@@ ca will equal about half the number of countries .
and when the east afri@@ can community with its five members ( bur@@ undi , ken@@ ya , r@@ wand@@ a , tan@@ z@@ ania , and ug@@ anda ) re-@@ emerg@@ es as scheduled , the number of currencies will be reduced by another four .
the belief that sovereign national currencies , by enabling independent and flexible monetary policies , are the best way to foster economic and social development – the vision of ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s post-@@ colonial leaders – is gradually falling by the wa@@ y@@ side .
efficiency dict@@ ates the use of fewer and larger currencies ( and foreign investors , understand@@ ably war@@ y of weak and vol@@ atile currencies , demand it ) .
indeed , the success of the europ@@ ean union and of the euro since its launch in 1999 has made a strong impression in afri@@ ca .
currencies , to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase win@@ ston chur@@ chill , are like democracies : the best way to preserve their integrity is to share them .
al@@ ex@@ ander ham@@ il@@ ton ’ s eurozone tour
pr@@ inc@@ et@@ on – europ@@ e ’ s debt crisis has pi@@ qu@@ ed europ@@ e@@ ans ’ interest in ameri@@ can prece@@ dents for federal finance .
for many , al@@ ex@@ ander ham@@ il@@ ton has become a contemporary her@@ o .
perhaps one day his face should appear on the € 10 ban@@ kno@@ te .
specifically , for europ@@ ean states gro@@ an@@ ing under unbe@@ ar@@ able debt burdens , ham@@ il@@ ton ’ s negotiation in 17@@ 90 of the new federal government ’ s assumption of the states ’ large debts looks like a temp@@ ting model .
indeed , after th@@ om@@ as sar@@ gent won the no@@ bel prize in economics last year , he c@@ ited it as a prece@@ dent in his acceptance speech .
ham@@ il@@ ton argued – against j@@ ames ma@@ dis@@ on and th@@ om@@ as je@@ ffer@@ son – that the debts accumul@@ ated by the states during the war of independence should be assumed by the federation .
there were two sides to his case , one practical , the other philosoph@@ ical .
initially , the most appe@@ aling argument for his plan was that it would provide greater security to credi@@ tors , and thus reduce interest rates , from the 6 % at which the states financed their debt to 4 % .
ham@@ il@@ ton empha@@ sized the importance of a commitment to sound finance as a prerequisite to public economy . “ when the credit of a country is in any degree question@@ able , ” he argued , “ it never fails to give an ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant premium upon all the loans it has occasion to make . ”
while that logic certainly appe@@ als to europ@@ e@@ ans today , ham@@ il@@ ton insisted on a stronger reason for pursuing sound finance than merely the pursuit of expe@@ di@@ ency .
there is , he maintained , “ an intimate connection between public virtu@@ e and public happ@@ iness . ”
that virtu@@ e consist@@ ed in hon@@ oring commitments , and it would build solidarity in the new political community of the united states .
indeed , public virtu@@ e made federal finance what he called “ the powerful cement of our union . ”
the condition for success in the ameri@@ can case was that the us raised its own revenue , with feder@@ ally administer@@ ed customs houses initially providing the bulk of its recei@@ pts .
the logic of a need for specific revenue applies also in modern europ@@ e , where a reformed fiscal system might include common administration of valu@@ e-@@ added tax ( with the additional benefit of eliminating a considerable amount of cross-border fraud ) .
in the ameri@@ can case , however , unity carried a price : a ceiling was imposed on vir@@ g@@ inia ’ s exposure to the common debt .
only this in@@ duc@@ ement to the most powerful state in the union persu@@ aded ma@@ dis@@ on to drop his opposition to the proposal .
that compromise ( which also led to the us capital ’ s re@@ location to the district of colum@@ bia , on the border of vir@@ g@@ inia and mar@@ y@@ land ) may serve as a prece@@ dent for limiting ger@@ many ’ s li@@ abilities if euro@@ bonds , or some other deb@@ t-@@ mut@@ u@@ alization scheme , are introduced .
the us experiment in feder@@ alized finance was not immediately successful .
two important components of ham@@ il@@ ton ’ s financial architecture were not realized , or were realized im@@ perfectly .
he proposed a model of join@@ t-@@ stock banking on a national scale , which ran into immediate opposition ( c@@ uri@@ ously , his proposal was much more influ@@ ential in can@@ ada ) .
second , opponents eventually blocked his proposal for a national central bank .
the charter of the first bank of the united states was allowed to lap@@ se in 18@@ 11 ; a generation later , in 18@@ 36 , president and@@ re@@ w jack@@ son successfully opposed the charter of the second bank of the united states .
nor did the ham@@ il@@ ton@@ ian scheme of federal finance guarantee a peaceful comm@@ on@@ wealth .
in fact , the fiscal union proved to be explo@@ sive rather than ad@@ hesi@@ ve .
as international capital markets developed in the early nine@@ teenth century , state governments borro@@ wed on a large scale , quickly turning them from credi@@ tors into deb@@ tors .
a wave of state def@@ aults followed in the late 18@@ 30 ’ s .
a generation later , in the 18@@ 60 ’ s , the civil war between northern and southern states resulted in large part from a dispute about the character of financial burdens – amp at least from the south ’ s perspective .
ab@@ ra@@ ham lin@@ col@@ n ’ s original proposal to end the im@@ moral practice of sla@@ very by compens@@ ating sla@@ ve owners for man@@ um@@ is@@ sion was un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably expensive , so the union , according to the sla@@ ve-@@ holding con@@ feder@@ acy , was determined to ex@@ propri@@ ate the south .
the federal assumption of states ’ debts by itself could not guarantee political order .
the civil war revealed the centr@@ ality of a common foundation of mor@@ ality to ham@@ il@@ ton ’ s approach to debt and public finance .
europ@@ e@@ ans today have lat@@ ched onto the practical side of ham@@ il@@ ton ’ s argument – that is , the idea that debt mut@@ u@@ alization might be a means to cheaper credit ; but they have worked out neither the political institutions , nor the shared public virtu@@ e , that ham@@ il@@ ton deemed crucial .
the extended and politi@@ ci@@ zed debate about debt restructuring has made a ham@@ il@@ ton@@ ian solution more difficult , because the credit of the countries that would be party to it has become question@@ able .
an obvious starting point for a ham@@ il@@ ton@@ ian europ@@ e would be to set some standard limit for feder@@ alized national debt – perhaps the tar@@ n@@ ished threshold of 60 % of g@@ d@@ p that was mand@@ ated ( without adequate enforcement ) by the ma@@ astri@@ cht convergence criteria , or perhaps a lower limit .
debt exceeding that amount would be left to the responsibility of the member states .
collective bur@@ den-@@ sharing is in the long run the only non-@@ catastro@@ p@@ hic way out of europ@@ e ’ s current crisis , but that requires a substantially greater degree of political accountability and control on a europ@@ ean level .
the lesson to be learned from ham@@ il@@ ton and the us is that the necessary institutions will not function without a greater degree of moral consensus as well .
gen@@ eva – the ukra@@ ine crisis has evol@@ ved from acute to chronic .
the main question – will rus@@ sia d@@ are to inv@@ ade main@@ land ukra@@ ine ? – has been answered : not now .
so , now what ?
obviously , the kre@@ m@@ lin did not expect the west ’ s firm and united reaction to its anne@@ x@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a .
president v@@ ladimir pu@@ tin ’ s phone call to us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama on mar@@ ch 28 clearly demonstrated rus@@ sia ’ s e@@ ag@@ ern@@ ess to discuss “ de-@@ escal@@ ation . ”
pu@@ tin ’ s main objectives now are the removal of ukra@@ ine ’ s block@@ ade of mol@@ do@@ va ’ s pro-@@ rus@@ sian break@@ away region of trans@@ n@@ istri@@ a and ukra@@ inian “ feder@@ alization ” ( a eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism for the kre@@ m@@ lin ’ s back@@ -@@ door strategy to gain control over the country ’ s eastern and southern regions ) .
but there can be no return to business as usual any@@ time soon .
rus@@ sia ’ s invasion and anne@@ x@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a has triggered un@@ intended tec@@ ton@@ ic shi@@ fts in international politics .
while the long-term implications are still ha@@ zy , the immediate consequences are clear .
first , the rus@@ sian people will pay de@@ arly in terms of their own freedom for their leaders ’ reck@@ less decisions .
after the so@@ vi@@ et invasion of cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia in 1968 , the rus@@ sian po@@ et al@@ ex@@ ander gal@@ ich wrote : “ comp@@ atri@@ ots , our hom@@ eland is in danger !
our tanks are in a foreign land ! ” confron@@ tation with the west , seem@@ ingly un@@ avoid@@ able after the cri@@ me@@ a anschluss , will give rise to a “ mobili@@ zation ” regime .
rus@@ sia ’ s new draft budget , with its sky@@ ro@@ ck@@ eting military out@@ lays , along with par@@ ano@@ id talk of “ fifth colum@@ ns ” and “ national tra@@ it@@ ors , ” at@@ tests to this trend .
in such circumstances , sanctions that hit ordinary people will only help the regime consolidate its power .
second , the crisis has several geo@@ political rami@@ fications .
the kre@@ m@@ lin ’ s actions have under@@ mined europ@@ ean security ; delivered a body b@@ low to international law ; weak@@ ened the nuclear non-@@ proliferation regime by fat@@ ally undermining the role of security guarantees for non-@@ nuclear states ; and raised doubts about the pre@@ dict@@ ability of rus@@ sia under its current leaders .
all of this will have far-reaching effects in the years and decades ahead , ranging from the real@@ ign@@ ment of formal and informal al@@ liances and the milit@@ ari@@ zation of security arrangements to possible – and long-@@ discussed – adjustments in the international governance system .
rus@@ sia ’ s exp@@ ul@@ sion from the g-@@ 8 and renewed military buil@@ d-@@ ups are only the first of many such changes .
third , the ukra@@ ine crisis will completely transform rus@@ sia ’ s relations with the west .
during the first two decades after the cold war , a combination of suspici@@ on and pragmati@@ s@@ m prev@@ ailed on both sides , with competition in some respects and cooperation in others playing a crucial role in cop@@ ing with important international challenges .
the relationship ’ s transformation into an ad@@ vers@@ ari@@ al one will “ contamin@@ ate ” the international system , undermining potential solu@@ tion@@ sto many problems , from nu@@ clear@@ -@@ arms reduction and climate change to stabili@@ zing regional hot spots like sy@@ ria .
in response to western sanctions , the kre@@ m@@ lin will bring pressure to bear on the united states and its allies by creating problems elsewhere .
for example , rus@@ sia has already offered to build two new , non-@@ military nuclear re@@ actors in ir@@ an .
technological support for ir@@ an ’ s nuclear programs could impede the ongoing international negotiations aimed at preventing ir@@ an from developing nuclear weapons , especially as the ir@@ ani@@ ans are looking for leverage in the talks .
rus@@ sia could escal@@ ate the crisis by putting pressure on the us closer to home as well .
consider vene@@ zu@@ ela , where – as with ir@@ an ’ s nuclear program – rus@@ sia has demonstrated its willingness to take risks that it would not have taken before .
on f@@ ebru@@ ary 26 , rus@@ sian defense minister ser@@ ge@@ i sho@@ ig@@ u formally announced his government ’ s plan to expand its overseas military presence .
vene@@ zu@@ ela is high on its list , having already purchased more than three-@@ quarters of the $ 14.@@ 5 billion in arms sold by rus@@ sia in the region from 2001 to 2013 .
fourth , having anne@@ xed cri@@ me@@ a , rus@@ sia has lost ukra@@ ine , turning it from friend to fo@@ e .
ukra@@ ine ’ s industrial and manufacturing infrastructure evol@@ ved under the so@@ vi@@ et union as a compli@@ ment to rus@@ sia ’ s resource base .
after the so@@ vi@@ et union ’ s dis@@ solution , the rus@@ sian resource economy ’ s traditional links with ukra@@ ine , including extensive pipeline infrastructure , ensured access to europ@@ ean markets .
now , having lost ukra@@ ine ’ s industrial and manufacturing base , and with europ@@ e more determined than ever to reduce its dependence on rus@@ sian energy supplies , the kre@@ m@@ lin will need to turn e@@ ast@@ ward toward ch@@ ina , which will be happy to see rus@@ sia remain a resource economy in thr@@ all to it .
given all of these potential di@@ re consequences , it is vital to prevent cold war ii .
during the coming transition period , the world will need new mechanisms for international dialogue .
isolation of rus@@ sia would be counter@@ productive , merely ag@@ grav@@ ating its highly developed sense of vic@@ tim@@ ization and possibly turning it into a “ ro@@ gue ” state – truly a night@@ mare scenario , given that rus@@ sia has the world ’ s largest nuclear ar@@ senal .
instead , targeted economic sanctions and cali@@ br@@ ated military measures should be coupled with intensive and open political dialogue .
a personal meeting between us , rus@@ sian , and german leaders could be helpful in chann@@ eling relations toward a non-@@ destruc@@ tive course .
to be truly productive , such contact should not be limited to resolving the ukra@@ ine crisis – or to senior officials .
the ukra@@ ine crisis should not be allowed to ob@@ sc@@ ure the full range of challenges that the world faces .
in fact , the stand@@ off is more likely to be resolved construc@@ tively within a framework that seeks consensus on a broader agenda .
after all , any crisis creates new opportunities ( for example , the sy@@ ri@@ an civil war has promp@@ ted important action on chemical weapons ) .
the opportunity for rus@@ sia and the west is to generate the political will needed to address issues – above all , reform of an out@@ mo@@ ded system of international relations – that have been ignored for too long .
can nav@@ al@@ ny save rus@@ sia ?
mo@@ sco@@ w – in 18@@ 11 , assessing the possibility – or , rather , the im@@ possibility – of rus@@ sia ever under@@ going a west@@ ern@@ -@@ style transformation , the diplom@@ at and counter-@@ en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment phil@@ osop@@ her jo@@ se@@ ph de ma@@ ist@@ re fam@@ ously wrote , “ every nation has the government it deserves . ”
four@@ teen years later , the dec@@ em@@ br@@ ist revol@@ t – a movement of po@@ ets and army officers to t@@ opp@@ le cz@@ ar ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ as i and establish a constitutional mon@@ arch@@ y – seemed to refu@@ te de ma@@ ist@@ re ’ s claim .
yet the revol@@ t was sup@@ pressed , and the dec@@ em@@ br@@ ists were executed or ex@@ iled .
one do@@ om@@ ed officer fam@@ ously declared , “ you can ’ t hang us all . ”
rus@@ sia ’ s brutal twen@@ tieth century , with its total@@ it@@ ari@@ anism and gu@@ lags , nearly proved that officer – and de ma@@ ist@@ re – wrong .
no one “ deserves ” to be ruled so mon@@ stro@@ us@@ ly .
an estimated 20 million rus@@ si@@ ans per@@ ished under stal@@ in ’ s rule , and the rest were par@@ aly@@ zed with terror .
the twenty-@@ first century has been kin@@ der to rus@@ si@@ ans , at least so far .
but , while terror and fam@@ ine have been ab@@ sent , many of the op@@ pres@@ sive tac@@ tics of the past have been revi@@ ved under v@@ ladimir pu@@ tin ’ s mis@@ rule , now in its 14th year .
since 2003 , when the billi@@ on@@ aire oil oli@@ gar@@ ch mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was arrested for alleged em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement and fraud – after he da@@ red to support pu@@ tin ’ s political opponents – rus@@ sia ’ s elite has been largely brought to he@@ el .
none of them envisaged rot@@ ting in a labor camp like k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky .
under pu@@ tin , it seems , de ma@@ ist@@ re ’ s ma@@ x@@ im has received a new lease on life .
then in 2011 , massive protests against pu@@ tin and his party of “ cro@@ o@@ ks and th@@ ie@@ ves ” erup@@ ted , and al@@ ex@@ ei nav@@ al@@ ny , who co@@ ined that ep@@ i@@ th@@ et , became the face of rus@@ sia ’ s opposition .
nav@@ al@@ ny , a 3@@ 7-@@ year-old anti-@@ corruption lawyer , has been a thor@@ n in pu@@ tin ’ s side ever since .
recently , he announced that he has presidential ambitions ; in the meantime , he is seeking to become the may@@ or of mo@@ sco@@ w ( argu@@ ably the second most important political post in rus@@ sia ) .
the may@@ oral campaign is now in full s@@ wing , with the election on se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 8 the first in mo@@ sco@@ w in ten years , as pu@@ tin had simply been appointing loy@@ alists as may@@ ors and govern@@ ors throughout the country .
the inc@@ umb@@ ent may@@ or , ser@@ ge@@ y so@@ by@@ an@@ in , who has the full support of the kre@@ m@@ lin politi@@ cal@@ -@@ media machine , has been receiving person@@ al-@@ approval rat@@ ings above 90 % in recent opinion p@@ olls .
but nav@@ al@@ ny ’ s approval rat@@ ings are not far behind , at 80 % , and he has achieved them entirely on his own .
nav@@ al@@ ny ’ s candi@@ d@@ acy received a recent boost when he became a convic@@ ted criminal , following a trial that resem@@ bled k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky ’ s in terms of b@@ lat@@ ant political manipulation .
accused of fraud , nav@@ al@@ ny received a five-@@ year prison sentence for alle@@ ge@@ dly em@@ be@@ zz@@ ling from ki@@ ro@@ v@@ les , a provin@@ cial timber company .
but , in an unusual tw@@ ist , nav@@ al@@ ny was released from cu@@ sto@@ dy pending appeal of his conviction only a day after it was handed down .
that , some say , was because his supporters immediately took to the streets .
the li@@ ke@@ lier motivation is that pu@@ tin decided to let the election play out , rel@@ ying on nav@@ al@@ ny to lose .
in that case , so@@ by@@ an@@ in , who was appointed in 2010 , would gain the legitimacy that he has l@@ acked until now , and the opposition movement would be dis@@ credi@@ ted in the capital , whose residents form the core of nav@@ al@@ ny ’ s political base .
but what if nav@@ al@@ ny is elected ?
would his sentence be comm@@ uted , postponed , or annul@@ led ?
would he go to prison , mus@@ co@@ v@@ ites ’ choice not@@ with@@ standing ?
in a new challenge to de ma@@ ist@@ re ’ s ma@@ x@@ im , almost 200 young business@@ men over@@ came the fear inspired by k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky ’ s fate and don@@ ated funds to nav@@ al@@ ny ’ s campaign .
thir@@ ty-@@ seven of them signed what they called a new “ social contract . ”
according to their manifest@@ o , they “ expect nav@@ al@@ ny to defend the rule of law , support independent courts , and ensure that officials are really accountable before society . ”
they are investing “ rep@@ ut@@ ational , financial , organiz@@ ational , and other resources ” in a man who promises to hire competent advis@@ ers and free the city – and eventually the country – from en@@ demic corruption and abuse of power .
most of these young entrepreneurs have risen within the “ knowledge economy . ”
they include the invent@@ or of a cl@@ ou@@ d-@@ comp@@ uting service , the founder of an online lux@@ ur@@ y-@@ goods business , a developer of new banking technologies , and the cre@@ ator of a soci@@ al-@@ networking platform for doctors .
all of them have good educ@@ ations , and many hold ameri@@ can business degrees .
many of these business leaders would have preferred to stay out of politics ; but rus@@ sia ’ s poor education system , economic feu@@ d@@ alism , official hom@@ opho@@ bia , and other fest@@ ering problems have left them no choice .
and pu@@ tin himself has become an in@@ suff@@ er@@ ably vul@@ gar embar@@ rass@@ ment .
to be sure , nav@@ al@@ ny ’ s back@@ ers could em@@ ig@@ rate comfortably ; but , in@@ vigor@@ ated by their candidate ’ s campaign , they are willing to see whether he can make a difference .
indeed , nav@@ al@@ ny has become the only hope for competitive politics in rus@@ sia .
and , while rus@@ sian leaders may start out as reform@@ ers , they do not often remain so .
bor@@ is yel@@ ts@@ in began the 1990 ’ s as a cour@@ age@@ ous democ@@ rat , only to end up a cor@@ rupt , bi@@ bul@@ ous buff@@ o@@ on , while pu@@ tin initially vo@@ wed to bring law and order to the post-@@ yel@@ ts@@ in cha@@ os .
so mo@@ sco@@ w ’ s may@@ oral election is a moment of truth for nav@@ al@@ ny , the business leaders investing in his campaign , all mus@@ co@@ v@@ ites , and perhaps rus@@ sia as a whole .
as in the time of the dec@@ em@@ br@@ ists , anyone in rus@@ sia can suffer from over@@ we@@ ening government power , regardless of political belief .
fear and ap@@ ath@@ y have become ris@@ k@@ ier than taking a stand .
but the question remains : come se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 8 , can nav@@ al@@ ny and his supporters change rus@@ sia ’ s political culture of fear , or was de ma@@ ist@@ re right after all ?
al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch ’ s achievement
new y@@ or@@ k – it was 1985 , and change was in the air in the so@@ vi@@ et union .
aging general secret@@ aries were dro@@ pping like f@@ lies .
el@@ em kli@@ mo@@ v ’ s cin@@ em@@ atic mag@@ n@@ um op@@ us “ come and see ” depic@@ ted world war ii without the her@@ o@@ ics on which we were re@@ ared , highlighting the tremendous human suffering instead .
kli@@ mo@@ v ’ s approach ech@@ o@@ ed that of s@@ vet@@ lan@@ a al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch – this year ’ s no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate in literature – in her first book , war ’ s un@@ wom@@ an@@ ly face , published the year before .
but , whereas many r@@ ush@@ ed to see kli@@ mo@@ v ’ s film , al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch ’ s book did not seem to exc@@ ite readers .
the so@@ vi@@ et union , sup@@ pose@@ dly progressive , remained roo@@ ted in patri@@ arch@@ y .
women had jobs , but rarely care@@ ers .
women writers wrote exquisite po@@ et@@ ry and pro@@ se , and they were officially recognized as the equ@@ als ( well , almost ) of their male pe@@ ers ; but they ten@@ ded to avoid certain topics – and war was a man ’ s business .
and thus al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch begins war ’ s un@@ wom@@ an@@ ly face , “ there had been more than 3@@ ,000 wars in the world , and even more books .
but all we know about war is what men told us . ”
and men told us a lot . “ we always remember@@ ed the war , ” al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch recalled , “ at school , at home , at we@@ d@@ dings and christ@@ en@@ ings , during holidays and fun@@ er@@ als .
war and post-@@ war lived in the home of our soul . ” indeed , i had heard so much about the war by the time war ’ s un@@ wom@@ an@@ ly face came out , i had little interest in hearing more about it – whether the suffering and sacrifi@@ ce or the her@@ o@@ ism and tri@@ ump@@ h – from any perspective .
fast-@@ forward almost a decade .
ameri@@ ca was big on gender politics , and , as a gradu@@ ate student there , i was embar@@ rass@@ ed to be behind .
so i finally read war ’ s un@@ wom@@ an@@ ly face .
to my surprise , it was not w@@ wi@@ i that i learned about ; rather , i got my first gli@@ mp@@ se into the emo@@ tions that my own rel@@ atives experienced , as they fought and survi@@ ved the war .
people like my grand@@ mother had re@@ counted only the o@@ ft-@@ repeated male story , completely den@@ ying her own experience .
but her experience mat@@ tered , and al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch recognized that .
i was so inspired by war ’ s un@@ wom@@ an@@ ly face that a few years ago i wrote my own book deta@@ iling the en@@ dur@@ ance of women in my family in the war@@ -@@ ra@@ v@@ aged so@@ vi@@ et union .
other books by al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch were simil@@ arly inspir@@ ing .
zin@@ ky boys : so@@ vi@@ et voices from the afgh@@ an@@ istan war ( 1991 ) spoke of a distant fight – the n@@ in@@ e-@@ year so@@ vi@@ et war in afgh@@ an@@ istan – that ero@@ ded rus@@ sian culture and humanity , while voices from cher@@ nobyl : the oral history of a nuclear disaster ( 1997 ) medi@@ t@@ ated on the global significance of the nuclear disaster .
public reaction to both was mixed .
neither the state nor the people quite knew how they felt about afgh@@ an@@ istan or cher@@ nobyl – one a lost war , the other an in@@ comprehensible catastro@@ phe .
al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch has described herself as “ an ear , not a pen . ”
she list@@ ens and builds a story , before writing it down .
her talent is to make the private public , to ex@@ pose the thoughts that people are afraid to think .
al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch does not sh@@ y away from the hor@@ ri@@ fic aspects of her subject matter , exemp@@ li@@ fied in a passage from war ’ s un@@ wom@@ an@@ ly face : “ we didn ’ t just shoo@@ t &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; prisoners &@@ #@@ 93@@ ; … we p@@ inn@@ ed them up , like pig@@ s , with ra@@ m@@ ro@@ ds , cut into pieces .
honest , dar@@ ing , and sad , al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch ’ s books – containing stories in which life , broken and st@@ olen , is worse than death – show how a woman ’ s perspective can hum@@ ani@@ ze world problems and make them understandable to all .
in some ways , al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch ’ s liter@@ ary contribution , which the no@@ bel committee called “ a monu@@ ment to suffering and courage in our time , ” is equal to that of the au@@ stri@@ an no@@ vel@@ ist and play@@ w@@ right el@@ frie@@ de j@@ el@@ in@@ ek , whom the committee recognized in 2004 for her work ’ s femin@@ ist critique of au@@ stri@@ a ’ s n@@ az@@ i past and patri@@ arch@@ al present .
now , like j@@ el@@ in@@ ek , whose work was largely unknown to non-@@ german readers until she won the no@@ bel , al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch is finally being recognized for her profound impact .
her award sends a powerful message – not only about her talent , but also about the importance of the female perspective in the public sphere .
to be sure , al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch was far from inv@@ isi@@ ble before .
her books have been translated into 20 languages , with millions in circulation .
and , like many other no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates , including j@@ el@@ in@@ ek , she has played an active role in civil society , most recently taking a stand against rus@@ sia ’ s anne@@ x@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a .
interest@@ ingly , the frequency with which no@@ bel prizes have been awarded to women has been increasing .
in 1991 , n@@ ad@@ ine gor@@ di@@ mer was the first woman in more than a quar@@ ter-@@ century to receive the literature prize ; now , women receive it every 2-@@ 3 years .
moreover , this summer , the writer and liter@@ ary cri@@ tic sar@@ ah dan@@ i@@ us became the first woman in 200 years to serve as the permanent secret@@ ary of the swe@@ dish ac@@ ade@@ my , which choo@@ ses the no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate in literature .
but the patri@@ arch@@ al culture from which al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch emerged is far from dead .
recogni@@ zing the ways in which she has enrich@@ ed people ’ s thinking about difficult – and histor@@ ically mas@@ cul@@ ine – subjects can only be good , not only for the women she inspi@@ res , but also for the men she influences .
i have just finished al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch ’ s latest d@@ read@@ ful master@@ piece , secon@@ d@@ hand time , a brutal account of the cha@@ o@@ tic rus@@ sian capitalism of the 1990s .
in recent inter@@ views , al@@ ex@@ ie@@ vi@@ ch has said she is working on two more books – one about love , the other about aging .
i don ’ t want to read either of them , but i will .
living big data
cam@@ bridge – big data is made from the digital trail that we leave behind when we use credit cards , mobile phones , or the web .
used carefully and accurately , these data give us unprecedented scope to understand our society , and improve the way we live and work .
but what works in theory may not translate well in the real world , where complex human inter@@ actions cannot always be captured , even by the most sophisticated models .
big data requires us to experiment on a big scale .
my own laboratory , for example , is building a web site which , based on goo@@ gle maps , uses society ’ s digital trail to map poverty , inf@@ ant mortality , crime rates , changes in g@@ d@@ p , and other social indicators , neighbor@@ hood by neighbor@@ hood – all of which will be updated daily .
this new capability allows vie@@ wers to see , for example , where government initiatives are working or failing .
but , while such impressive visu@@ alization tools can dramatically enhance transparency and public knowledge , they are sur@@ pris@@ ingly limited when applied to solving society ’ s problems .
one reason is that such rich stre@@ ams of data encourage sp@@ urious cor@@ relations .
even the use of the normal scientific method no longer works ; given so many measurements , and so many more potential connections among what ’ s being measured , our standard statistical tools generate non@@ sen@@ sical results .
without knowing all possible alternatives , we cannot form a limited , te@@ stable set of clear hypo@@ thes@@ es .
and if we can no longer rely on laboratory experiments to test caus@@ ality , we must test it in the real world , using massive volumes of real-time data .
this involves moving beyond the closed , question@@ -@@ and-@@ answer process typical of the la@@ b , and applying our ideas in society , earlier and more frequently than ever before .
to see how things work in reality , we must construct living labor@@ atories – that is , communities willing to try new ways of doing things ( to be bl@@ unt , to act as gu@@ ine@@ a pig@@ s ) .
an example of such a living la@@ b is the “ open data city , ” which i launched with the city of tr@@ ento in ital@@ y , along with telec@@ om itali@@ a , telef@@ ó@@ nica , the research university fon@@ da@@ zione brun@@ o k@@ ess@@ ler , the institute for data driven design , and local companies .
importantly , this living la@@ b has the approval and informed consent of all involved ; they understand that they are participating in a gigan@@ tic experiment whose goal is to create a better way of living .
one major challenge for a living la@@ b is to protect individual privacy without dimin@@ ishing the potential for better government .
the tr@@ ento la@@ b , for example , will pilot my proposed “ new deal on data , ” which gives users greater control over their personal data through tru@@ st-@@ network software such as our open p@@ ds ( personal data store ) system .
we hope that the ability to share data safely , while protecting privacy , will encourage individuals , companies , and governments to communicate their ideas widely , and so increase productivity and creativity across the entire city .
but the biggest difficulty in using big data to build a better society is being able to develop a hum@@ an-@@ scale , intuitive understanding of social physi@@ cs .
although den@@ se , continuous data and modern comp@@ utation allow us to map many details about society , and to explain how communities might work , such raw mathemati@@ cal models contain too many variables and complex relationships for most people to understand .
what is needed is some kind of dialogue between human intu@@ ition and the comp@@ elling reality of big data – a dialogue that is currently ab@@ sent from management and government systems .
if big data is to be deployed effectively , people must be able to understand and interpre@@ t the relevant statistics .
this calls for a new understanding of human behavior and social dynam@@ ics that goes beyond traditional economic and political models .
only by developing the science and language of social physi@@ cs will we be able to make a world of big data a world in which we want to live .
bag@@ h@@ dad – i@@ ra@@ q ’ s recent parliamentary election , the first since united states troops left the country in 2011 , was held am@@ id a rising ti@@ de of violence that is fast appro@@ aching the levels experienced during the 200@@ 5-@@ 2007 ins@@ urgency .
can the new government restore order and address the many immense challenges that i@@ ra@@ q faces ?
the challenges are indeed da@@ un@@ ting .
the authorities must resolve fundamental constitutional questions ( such as whether i@@ ra@@ q should be a federal state or a con@@ federation ) , re@@ build civil society , reform state institutions , re@@ construct the economy , and end the waste and corruption in the oil sector .
but perhaps the most in@@ trac@@ table challenge of all is bri@@ dging the sec@@ t@@ arian ri@@ ft between the country ’ s shi@@ a and sun@@ ni citizens .
these f@@ issu@@ res are mir@@ ro@@ red in other ar@@ ab countries ( such as sy@@ ria , le@@ ban@@ on , the g@@ ulf countries , and y@@ emen ) and , increasingly , in the wider mus@@ li@@ m world ( including pak@@ istan , mal@@ ay@@ sia , and in@@ don@@ esia ) .
is this a historical aber@@ ration , or are is@@ lam ’ s two largest sec@@ ts condemned to perpet@@ ual mutual ho@@ stil@@ ity ?
certainly , there have been periods when the two communities have co@@ existed peac@@ efully .
but what matters today is that shi@@ a and sun@@ ni relate to their past differently , and that this historical memory can be distor@@ ted – and even inv@@ ented – to create m@@ istr@@ ust and h@@ ate .
the over@@ throw of the first mus@@ li@@ m d@@ yn@@ asty , the staun@@ ch@@ ly anti-@@ shi@@ a u@@ may@@ y@@ ads , in the year 750 , by the ab@@ basi@@ ds , who trac@@ ed their lin@@ e@@ age to the pro@@ ph@@ et mu@@ ham@@ mad ’ s un@@ cle , raised hopes , albeit short-@@ lived , of a sun@@ ni@@ -@@ shi@@ a rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement .
the 500 years of ab@@ basi@@ d re@@ ign that followed provide many valuable illustr@@ ations of how these two communities subsequently related to each other .
in particular , there is much to be learned from the different leg@@ acies of the cali@@ ph al-@@ na@@ si@@ r ( 1@@ 18@@ 0-@@ 12@@ 25 ) and the last ab@@ basi@@ d cali@@ ph , al-@@ mu@@ sta ’ si@@ m ( 12@@ 4@@ 2-@@ 12@@ 58 ) .
the rule of al-@@ na@@ si@@ r – who viewed the shi@@ a as an in@@ trin@@ sic part of the islam@@ ic community and sought to treat all of his subjects equally – was characterized by a marked decrease in sec@@ t@@ arian tensions .
by contrast , sun@@ ni@@ -@@ shi@@ a clas@@ hes – including k@@ ill@@ ings , ar@@ son , and other violence – were common during al-@@ mu@@ sta ’ si@@ m ’ s rule .
these examples demonstrate the importance of good leadership when communities that uphold different claims to the truth are subject to the same political authority – especially when these communities seek assurance that their survival is not threatened .
i@@ ra@@ q ’ s current political leaders need to learn from this past and ensure that none of the country ’ s communities face margin@@ alization or discrimination – lessons that apply throughout the mus@@ li@@ m world .
in pak@@ istan , for example , there are sec@@ t@@ arian k@@ ill@@ ings almost daily ; in mal@@ ay@@ sia , the tiny shi@@ a population is viewed as an exist@@ ential threat ; and inc@@ endi@@ ary language domin@@ ates dis@@ course about rival sec@@ ts in wah@@ hab@@ i cir@@ cles in sau@@ di arab@@ ia and far beyond .
politics and power stru@@ gg@@ les explain much of the violence and m@@ istr@@ ust .
fear of ir@@ ani@@ an-@@ led he@@ gem@@ ony , for example , has focused g@@ ulf leaders ’ minds on their shi@@ a population ’ s loy@@ alty .
mal@@ ay@@ sia ’ s political parties use anti-@@ shi@@ a anim@@ us to spread fear , helping to attract votes and consolidate power .
sy@@ ria and its regional allies are determined to protect a new regional balance of power that shi@@ fted in their favor following the us-@@ led invasion of i@@ ra@@ q .
but political calculation cannot explain everything .
the fall of sad@@ dam hus@@ sein in 2003 provides a good example of how a political event , viewed through a sec@@ t@@ arian lens , can be interpreted differently .
the us destruction of the i@@ ra@@ q@@ i state brought about a prec@@ arious new order that sought to red@@ ress years of sun@@ ni domin@@ ance by favor@@ ing the shi@@ a .
however , the shock of sudden sun@@ ni dis@@ em@@ power@@ ment generated a dis@@ course , widely shared in the mus@@ li@@ m world , in which the shi@@ a are guilty of col@@ lu@@ sion in the us occupation of the country – a view reinforced by events in sy@@ ria .
according to this thesis , the shi@@ a simply rever@@ ted to their “ historic ” role as w@@ reck@@ ers and fifth colum@@ nis@@ ts .
was it not the case , it is claimed , that the shi@@ a also col@@ lu@@ ded with the mon@@ g@@ ols in the fall of bag@@ h@@ dad in 12@@ 58 , cul@@ min@@ ating in the death of the last ab@@ basi@@ d cali@@ ph and the destruction of the ab@@ basi@@ d emp@@ ire , the “ universal state ” of mus@@ li@@ ms ?
several medieval mus@@ li@@ m hist@@ ori@@ ans pointed to the role of the shi@@ a vi@@ zi@@ er i@@ bn al@@ - ‘ al@@ q@@ ami , argu@@ ing that he plo@@ t@@ ted with the mon@@ g@@ ols to bring down the cali@@ ph@@ ate .
once the preserve of a hand@@ ful of schol@@ ars , the i@@ bn al@@ - ‘ al@@ q@@ ami story now plays a prominent part in today ’ s sun@@ ni@@ - shi@@ a disputes .
indeed , “ ‘ al@@ a@@ q@@ ima , ” the pl@@ ural form of the arab@@ ic name “ ‘ al@@ q@@ ami , ” is now applied to the shi@@ a as short-@@ hand for tre@@ ach@@ ery .
social media forums are re@@ ple@@ te with pole@@ m@@ ics about the shi@@ a role in assisting both mon@@ go@@ l and us inv@@ aders .
many even claim that i@@ ra@@ q ’ s shi@@ a are al@@ - ‘ al@@ q@@ ami ’ s des@@ cen@@ dants , and that no@@ ur@@ i al-@@ mali@@ ki , i@@ ra@@ q ’ s prime minister , is his modern inc@@ ar@@ nation .
these di@@ atri@@ bes reflect i@@ ra@@ q@@ i ’ s pol@@ ari@@ zed historical memory .
despite ample historical evidence of peaceful inter-@@ commun@@ al relations , many people – whether through simple ignor@@ ance of history or the need to asser@@ t the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of one version of the truth – prefer to consec@@ rate nar@@ rati@@ ves of tre@@ ach@@ ery and betra@@ yal that perpet@@ u@@ ate hat@@ red .
more important , the current situation reflects a lack of wisdom , responsibility , and basic dec@@ ency on the part of political and religious leaders , who prefer to fuel , rather than dam@@ pen , inter-@@ commun@@ al stri@@ fe .
sad@@ ly , in@@ tolerance has now become a gener@@ alized condition .
there is too little knowledge about other communities ’ belie@@ fs and history , and what little exists has been overwhel@@ med by sec@@ t@@ arian anger and its po@@ ison@@ ous rhetoric .
as long as sun@@ nis and shi@@ a refuse to think about their past together , it is difficult to fore@@ see a tranquil future together .
and if political and religious leaders are unable or un@@ willing to seek accommodation , it will be up to lik@@ e-@@ minded individuals , groups , and civil@@ -@@ society institutions to re@@ build mutual respect and find ways to cooperate .
doing so will require knowledge , pati@@ ence , and , above all , open minds and hearts .
a liquid europ@@ e
br@@ ussel@@ s – is the eurozone step@@ ping back from the br@@ ink ?
this might just be possible , because the emerging out@@ lines of a new framework to resolve the ongoing sovereign@@ -@@ debt crisis contain a key component that was missing so far .
indeed , that component ’ s absence was behind this summer ’ s spreading financial crisis , which moved beyond small , peripheral countries like gre@@ ece , i@@ reland , and portu@@ gal to strike system@@ ically important countries like ital@@ y and sp@@ ain .
the starting point of the con@@ ta@@ gion was investors ’ re@@ alization that europ@@ e ’ s rescue fund , the europ@@ ean financial stability facility , was designed to provide emergency financial support only to the peripheral countries .
it simply does not and will never have enough funds to undertake the massive bond purchases required to stabili@@ ze the debt markets of large economies such as sp@@ ain and ital@@ y .
the ef@@ s@@ f will have at most € 4@@ 40 billion at its disposal ( any increase would en@@ danger fran@@ ce ’ s a@@ a@@ a rating ) , while the combined public debt of ital@@ y and sp@@ ain is more than € 2 tril@@ lion .
in early aug@@ ust , the dom@@ ino effect of the eurozone peripher@@ y ’ s sovereign@@ -@@ debt crisis started to k@@ ick in , because financial markets do not wait for country after country to be down@@ gra@@ ded .
instead , they tend to anticip@@ ate the end@@ game , or at least one potential scenario , namely the un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing of the entire cris@@ is-@@ con@@ tainment structure .
markets noticed that the euro seemed caught between a rock ( the ef@@ s@@ f ’ s limited borro@@ wing capacity ) and a hard place ( the europ@@ ean central bank ’ s great reluc@@ tance to engage in large-scale purchases of financially troub@@ led governments ’ bonds ) .
it later turned out that the ec@@ b was not that hard after all , though it empha@@ sized that it would stop interven@@ ing as soon as the new ef@@ s@@ f became operational .
and , given the ef@@ s@@ f ’ s limited fire@@ power , the market would have been left without support .
to state the problem more generally , the eurozone requires a liquidity back@@ stop for its fiscal authority .
in a “ normal ” economy with its own currency , the fiscal authorities can never face a liquidity shortage , because the government can always rely , at least potentially , on support from the central bank .
a eurozone government , by contrast , is always in a prec@@ arious situation : it has only very long-term assets ( its tax@@ ing power ) and shor@@ ter-@@ term li@@ abilities , namely government debt , much of which has to be rolled over annually .
if investors refuse to buy the debt on any terms , even a fis@@ cally pru@@ dent government could find itself in a liquidity squ@@ ee@@ ze and become in@@ sol@@ vent .
simil@@ arly , banks have short-term li@@ abilities ( deposits ) and long-term assets , which they cannot liqui@@ date quickly without inc@@ urr@@ ing great losses .
this is why all countries provide emergency liquidity support when a bank run materi@@ ali@@ zes , as was done on a global scale when confidence in the banking sector collap@@ sed alongside leh@@ man bro@@ thers in 2008 .
likewise , the eurozone needs a mechanism to confront runs on its member countries ’ government debt .
this requires that fiscal authorities have access to a large pool of liquidity in an emergency .
only the ec@@ b can provide this insurance .
the good news is that a solution is now slowly taking shape that promises to create a mechanism by which the ec@@ b could back@@ stop the ef@@ s@@ f .
this could be achieved simply by register@@ ing the ef@@ s@@ f as a bank , which would give it access to normal ec@@ b re@@ financing on the same terms as other normal banks .
the ef@@ s@@ f could then conduct very large purchases of government debt by le@@ ver@@ ing up its limited capital through ec@@ b re@@ financing , using the government bonds it is buying as col@@ lateral .
the ef@@ s@@ f would be responsible for dealing with fiscal crises in member states .
for countries with solvency problems , an adjustment program like those for gre@@ ece , i@@ reland , or portu@@ gal would be appropriate .
but , for large countries facing a liquidity shortage , the ef@@ s@@ f could rely on support from the ec@@ b .
if investors know that a liquidity squ@@ ee@@ ze is no longer possible , they will refrain from specul@@ ative attacks on sol@@ vent countries .
the near@@ -@@ pan@@ ic conditions in financial markets e@@ ased as soon as rum@@ ors spread that this solution had at least been discussed behind closed doors .
it now needs to be implemented .
as always in europ@@ e , there are legal and political obstacles to change .
but even the most reluc@@ tant policymakers recognize that the cost of in@@ action is too great .
the legal obstacles to potential “ monetary financing ” of the public sector in the europ@@ ean union ’ s governing treaties can be overcome .
the more important obstacle is ger@@ many ’ s reluc@@ tance to admit publicly that ec@@ b liquidity support for government debt markets can be crucial in maintaining financial stability .
only the german government and the ec@@ b can open the door to this sub@@ tle but profound reform of the euro ’ s fundamental underp@@ inn@@ ings .
it is a choice that they cannot put off much longer .
all for one tax and one tax for all ?
cam@@ bridge – when the next full-@@ scale global financial crisis h@@ its , let it not be said that the international monetary fund never took a stab at fore@@ st@@ alling it .
recently , the im@@ f proposed a new global tax on financial institutions loo@@ sely in proportion to their size , as well as a tax on banks ’ profits and bon@@ uses .
the fund ’ s proposal has been gre@@ eted with predictable dis@@ da@@ in and der@@ ision by the financial industry .
more interesting and significant are the mixed reviews from g-@@ 20 presiden@@ ts and finance ministers .
governments at the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the recent financial crisis , especially the united states and the united king@@ dom , are down@@ right enthusi@@ astic , particularly about the tax on size .
after all , they want to do that anyway .
countries that did not experience recent bank mel@@ t@@ down@@ s , such as can@@ ada , au@@ str@@ alia , ch@@ ina , bra@@ zi@@ l , and indi@@ a , are un@@ enthusi@@ astic .
why should they change systems that proved so re@@ sili@@ ent ?
it is all too easy to cri@@ tici@@ ze the specific@@ s of the im@@ f plan .
but the im@@ f ’ s big@@ -@@ picture diagnosis of the problem gets a lot right .
financial systems are blo@@ ated by imp@@ licit taxpa@@ yer guarantees , which allow banks , particularly large ones , to bor@@ row money at interest rates that do not fully reflect the risks they take in search of out@@ sized profits .
since that risk is then passed on to taxpayers , imposing taxes on financial firms in proportion to their borro@@ wing is a simple way to ensure fairness .
“ what risks ? ” the financial firms demand to know .
the average cost of the ba@@ il@@ outs was “ only ” a few percentage points of gn@@ p .
the im@@ f rightly points out that these claims are non@@ sense .
during the crisis , taxpayers were on the ho@@ ok for almost a quarter of national income .
perhaps the next crisis will not turn out so “ well , ” and the losses borne by the public will be stag@@ gering .
even with the “ success ” of the ba@@ il@@ outs , countries suffered massive output losses due to rec@@ essions and sustained sub@@ par growth .
but , while regulation must address the over@@ sized bank balance sheets that were at the root of the crisis , the im@@ f is right not to focus exc@@ essively on fixing the “ too big to fail ” problem .
a surprising number of pun@@ di@@ ts seem to think that if one could only break up the big banks , governments would be far more re@@ sili@@ ent to ba@@ il@@ outs , and the whole “ moral haz@@ ard ” problem would be mut@@ ed .
that logic is du@@ bi@@ ous , given how many similar crises have hit widely differ@@ ing systems over the centuries .
a system@@ ic crisis that simultaneously h@@ its a large number of medium-sized banks would put just as much pressure on governments to ba@@ il out the system as would a crisis that h@@ its a couple of large banks .
there are altogether too many complex ideas flo@@ ating around that look good on paper , but might well prove deeply fla@@ wed in a big@@ -@@ time crisis .
any robust solution must be reasonably simple to understand and implement .
the im@@ f proposal seems to pass these tests .
by contrast , some finance specialists favor forcing banks to rely much more on “ contin@@ gent ” debt that can be for@@ ci@@ bly converted to ( possibly worth@@ less ) stock in the event of a system@@ -@@ wide mel@@ t@@ down .
but how this form of “ pre-@@ pack@@ aged bankrupt@@ cy ” could be implemented in a world of widely different legal , political , and banking systems is un@@ clear .
financial history is lit@@ tered with un@@ tested saf@@ et@@ y-@@ net devices that failed in a crisis .
better to rein in the growth of the system .
the im@@ f is on much weaker ground , however , in thinking that its one-@@ si@@ z@@ e-@@ fit@@ s-@@ all global tax system will som@@ ehow level the playing field internationally .
it won ’ t .
countries that now have solid financial regulatory systems in place are already effectively “ tax@@ ing ” their financial firms more than , say , the us and the uk , where financial regulation is more minimal .
the us and the uk don ’ t want to weak@@ en their competitive advantage by tax@@ ing banks while some other countries do not .
but it is their systems that are in the greatest and most urgent need of stronger checks and balances .
let ’ s not go too far in defending the “ hol@@ d@@ out ” countries that are resist@@ ing the im@@ f proposal .
these countries need to recognize that if the us and the uk do implement even modest reforms , a lot of capital will flow elsewhere , potentially overwhelming regulatory systems that seemed to work well until now .
and what about the second tax proposed by the im@@ f , on banks ’ profits and bon@@ uses ?
such a tax is politically appe@@ aling , but ultimately it makes little sense – except , perhaps , in a crisis year when bank subsidies are g@@ lar@@ ingly transparent .
it would be better to improve finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ market regulation directly and let national tax systems handle banks ’ income like that of any other industry .
the im@@ f ’ s first effort at prescri@@ bing a cure may be fla@@ wed , but its diagnosis of a financial sector blo@@ ated by moral haz@@ ard is manifest@@ ly correct .
let ’ s hope that when the g-@@ 20 leaders meet later this year , they decide to take the problem seriously instead of t@@ abling discussion for a decade or two until the next crisis is upon us .
all in the family
m@@ un@@ ich – big economic crises often cause i@@ con@@ ic companies to fal@@ ter .
ru@@ per@@ t mur@@ doch ’ s media emp@@ ire is a model of the modern global enterprise .
a particularly dynamic and innovative business model came from outside and took over central aspects of bri@@ tish and then ameri@@ can public life .
that model is now threatened by the fall@@ out from the sc@@ andal that started with phone h@@ acking in mur@@ doch ’ s bri@@ tish press operations .
the mur@@ doch experience is a micro@@ cos@@ m of how modern globalization works .
mur@@ doch always looked like a foreign in@@ tru@@ sion into bri@@ tish life .
it was not just that he was au@@ str@@ ali@@ an ; he also brought new ideas .
in particular , the application of digital technology , introduced after a fer@@ o@@ cious struggle with the powerful print unions , brought substantial cost savings and allowed a new era of journ@@ alism .
even more importantly , mur@@ doch represented a concept of family business that is common in many parts of the world , but relatively rare in b@@ rit@@ ain and the united states .
family capitalism in the continental europ@@ ean model uses relatively little capital to achieve maximum control .
this sort of firm is also very common in the most dynamic emerg@@ ing-@@ market economies in a@@ sia and l@@ atin ameri@@ ca .
the mur@@ doch family holds only 12 % of the shares of news cor@@ poration , the top-@@ level holding company , but it wi@@ el@@ ds about two-@@ fif@@ ths of the voting rights ; other votes are held by a lo@@ yal sau@@ di prin@@ ce .
their defen@@ ders point out that such companies often have a much lon@@ ger-@@ term vision than is true of man@@ ag@@ erial capitalism , which enables them to establish strong and en@@ during relationships with their customers and suppliers .
at least in the case of the mur@@ doch emp@@ ire , it now appears that they pursue long and binding relationships with politicians and the police as well .
indeed , political ent@@ ang@@ lements are one of two sources of weakness in europ@@ e@@ an-@@ style family capitalism , as owners seek political advantages and preferred access as much as they strive for technical innovation .
mur@@ doch ’ s emp@@ ire depen@@ ded on its clo@@ sen@@ ess to politicians .
in retro@@ spec@@ t , three successive bri@@ tish prime ministers – ton@@ y bla@@ ir , g@@ ord@@ on bro@@ wn , and da@@ vi@@ d cam@@ eron – were on over@@ ly familiar terms with a manipul@@ ative business leader .
cam@@ eron now talks about the need for “ a health@@ ier relationship between politicians and media owners . ”
and mur@@ doch apparently is now saying that he wishes that all these prime ministers would “ leave me alone . ”
the second not@@ orious weakness of family businesses is the problem of succ@@ ession .
when he appeared before the bri@@ tish parliament in ju@@ ly , ru@@ per@@ t mur@@ doch looked like an old man , remote and out of control .
in ol@@ d-@@ style family firms , there is a clear rule of succ@@ ession that the oldest son takes over .
but that rule is rightly recognized as being potentially d@@ ys@@ functional .
there is obviously no guarantee that the oldest son is the best business@@ man , and the result could be bit@@ ter and fer@@ o@@ cious si@@ bling ri@@ val@@ ry .
such succ@@ ession disputes become even more acute when there are multiple marri@@ ages and multiple sets of competing children .
until the erup@@ tion of the current sc@@ andal , the yo@@ ung@@ est of mur@@ doch ’ s three children from his second marriage , j@@ ames , was generally believed to stand the greatest chance of succ@@ ee@@ ding his father .
the comple@@ xi@@ ties of modern marriage patterns make family life much more frau@@ ght , especially when phenom@@ en@@ al power and huge sums of money are involved .
all three of mur@@ doch ’ s marri@@ ages have produced children , though those from his current relationship are too young to be considered potential corporate success@@ ors .
re@@ bek@@ ah bro@@ o@@ ks , the editor of the news of the world at the beginning of the ph@@ one-@@ h@@ acking sc@@ andal , and subsequently the chief executive of news international , mur@@ doch ’ s bri@@ tish subsidiary , played precisely such a role .
indeed , the crisis of the mur@@ doch family ’ s business emp@@ ire is neither unique nor unprecedented .
in the first half of the 1990 ’ s , many observers of the alleged asi@@ an economic mi@@ racle empha@@ sized trust and families ’ capacity to cooperate with political authorities in order to realize long-term growth plans .
after the 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 a@@ sia crisis , and as author@@ itarian regimes in south korea and in@@ don@@ esia dis@@ integrated , these relationships were suddenly interpreted as cor@@ rupt , and the counter-@@ view – that “ c@@ ron@@ y capitalism ” had become entr@@ en@@ ched in these countries – soon prev@@ ailed .
the ar@@ ab spring has been in large part a movement against cor@@ rupt family capitalism , embo@@ died not only in ruling families like the ben al@@ is , the mu@@ bar@@ aks , and the ass@@ ads , but also in the large family business emp@@ ires that depen@@ ded on and supported them .
as a result of globalization , large family firms could increase their size and their geographic range .
but globalization also increases the chances of bac@@ kl@@ ash@@ es that focus on the vulner@@ abilities , weaknesses , and mistakes of big family firms .
they are vulnerable to an ar@@ ab spring ( and a bri@@ tish summer ) – and maybe to a us autumn that will focus not just on the mur@@ do@@ chs ’ business , but also on its inter@@ play with politics .
new del@@ hi – ern@@ est hem@@ ing@@ way ’ s collection of stories , men without women , exam@@ ines ten@@ se gender relationships .
in a particularly po@@ ign@@ ant story , a young man convin@@ ces his partner to have an abor@@ tion , viewing their un@@ born child as a hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ce to the status quo .
frustr@@ ated , the woman gives in .
that story , published more than 80 years ago , remains relevant today in indi@@ a , where female fet@@ uses face severe risks .
according to the 2011 cen@@ sus , the sex ratio of the country ’ s children has di@@ pped from 9@@ 27 fem@@ ales per 1000 m@@ ales to 9@@ 14 , a 6@@ 0-@@ year low .
rati@@ os in the northern states are particularly alarming : only hi@@ mach@@ al pra@@ des@@ h now has a ratio of girls to boys above 900 .
despite being illegal , ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und sex@@ -@@ determination tests are being used across indi@@ a to identify for abor@@ tion extraordinary numbers of healthy female fet@@ uses .
but there are serious concerns about legal operations , too .
gen@@ it@@ op@@ la@@ sty – a sex@@ -@@ change operation on new@@ born girls – is a mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oming , and deeply distur@@ bing , business in indi@@ a .
there ’ s only one word for it : gen@@ der@@ cide .
left un@@ checked , it will leave indi@@ a ’ s next generation of men with a severe shortage of women .
indi@@ an couples have a strong cultural preference , bor@@ dering on ob@@ session , for sons over dau@@ gh@@ ters – despite the stri@@ des in education and employment that women have made over the last few decades .
education and wealth have nothing to do with it – in fact , some of the wor@@ st-@@ affected areas are in indi@@ a ’ s weal@@ thi@@ est cities .
however dis@@ com@@ f@@ iting a possibility , the real cul@@ pri@@ t might be indi@@ an culture and tradition itself .
the expenses and pressure of the dow@@ ry system , and the fact that , in most joint families , only sons inher@@ it property and wealth , contribute to this favor@@ i@@ tism .
perhaps just as important is that sons typically live with their parents even after they are married , and assume responsibility for parents in their old age .
dau@@ gh@@ ters , who live with their in-@@ laws after they mar@@ ry , are viewed as am@@ an@@ at – someone else ’ s property .
in short , sons represent income and dau@@ gh@@ ters an expense .
in the old days , when families typically had 5-@@ 10 children , this didn ’ t matter so much .
the number of sons and dau@@ gh@@ ters often even@@ ed out .
but , for today ’ s smaller families , whether the children are two boys or two girls influences everything from financial planning to preparations for old age .
many have argued that indi@@ an women should stand up to their families and refuse to ab@@ ort their dau@@ gh@@ ters .
but indi@@ an women want male children just as much .
unlike hem@@ ing@@ way ’ s character , they are often more than willing to ab@@ ort a girl and try for a boy .
the no@@ vel@@ ist sal@@ man r@@ ush@@ die once put the question to supporters of abor@@ tion rights : “ what should be done when a woman uses her power over her own body to discrimin@@ ate against female fet@@ uses ? ”
this raises other questions concerning the consequences of a large shortage of girls .
will women be valued and treas@@ ured ?
or will the over@@ supply of men result in more bri@@ de trafficking , sexual violence , and female suici@@ des ?
ni@@ all fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the bri@@ tish hist@@ orian , c@@ ites schol@@ ars who attri@@ bute jap@@ an ’ s imperi@@ al expansion after 19@@ 14 to a male youth bul@@ ge , and who link the rise of islam@@ ist extremis@@ m to an islam@@ ic youth bul@@ ge .
“ maybe the coming generation of asi@@ an men without women will find harm@@ less out@@ lets for their inevitable frustr@@ ations , like team sports or video games .
but i doubt it , ” he writ@@ es .
he war@@ ns us not to be surprised if , in the coming generation , “ sh@@ ri@@ ll nation@@ alism is replaced by mach@@ o militar@@ ism or even imperi@@ alism . ”
unfortunately , there is no instant solution .
saving our girls will require radi@@ cally alter@@ ing some of indi@@ an society ’ s family arrangements , traditions , and attitudes .
and there is no easy way to accompl@@ ish this .
legislation alone won ’ t help , for tradition is a law unto itself .
hin@@ du religious law , for example , allows a woman to claim an equal share in her parents ’ wealth , but few exercise this right .
nonetheless , indi@@ a does need new laws – direct and enfor@@ ce@@ able – that cl@@ amp down on the cultural practices that underp@@ in destruc@@ tive traditions .
for example , indi@@ a could enforce a ceiling on wedding expenditure – typically a father ’ s biggest expense associated with his daughter .
constra@@ ined from spending on the wedding , he would compensate her differently – perhaps with a larger inher@@ it@@ ance .
gradually , this would become the nor@@ m , and tradition would adjust accordingly .
( interest@@ ingly , the state of ker@@ ala , whose people adhere to mat@@ ri@@ lin@@ e@@ al inher@@ it@@ ance , has among the most equal sex rati@@ os and liter@@ acy rates in indi@@ a . )
a more radical measure , which some have advoc@@ ated , would be direction intervene , with the state providing benefits for families with more girls .
perhaps the authorities could also pen@@ alize families with boys , at least temporarily .
indi@@ a ima@@ g@@ ines herself as a woman – b@@ har@@ at mat@@ a , or mother indi@@ a .
the ir@@ ony is that , unless far-reaching changes are made soon , mother indi@@ a could eventually be the only woman left in the country .
all quiet on the bur@@ undi front ?
like its neigh@@ b@@ ors , con@@ go and r@@ wand@@ a , bur@@ undi is a war@@ -@@ tor@@ n land .
its troub@@ les have not ri@@ v@@ eted world attention in recent years , probably because bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s re@@ bels failed to pl@@ umb the dep@@ ths of sav@@ ag@@ ery seen in r@@ wand@@ a and con@@ go .
but , unlike its neigh@@ b@@ ors , this year can mark a turning point for bur@@ undi .
thanks to agreements between the re@@ bels and the government that n@@ elson mand@@ ela and south afri@@ can vice president jac@@ ob zu@@ ma helped bro@@ ker , bur@@ undi can now either turn decisi@@ vely away from civil stri@@ fe , or risk a return to the mach@@ ete politics that have mau@@ led afri@@ ca &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s great lakes region for a decade .
since its independence from bel@@ gi@@ um in 1962 , bur@@ undi has suffered five episo@@ des of what amounts to the same civil war .
about 600@@ ,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands made into refugees .
many portra@@ y this war as the result of hat@@ red between the majority hut@@ u and the minority tut@@ si .
but this does not explain why these groups sup@@ pose@@ dly h@@ ate each other so much .
bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s cultural and linguistic homo@@ gen@@ eit@@ y , rare in afri@@ ca , be@@ lies the simpl@@ istic view that the hut@@ u and tut@@ si fight because they are so different .
indeed , most countries are far more hetero@@ gen@@ eous than bur@@ undi but have never fallen into ethnic war .
to understand the dynam@@ ics of conflict in bur@@ undi , we need to examine three root causes .
the first such cause is the legacy of colon@@ ization .
in the 19@@ 20 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s and 1930 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s , the bel@@ gian authorities en@@ acted policies that defined the population along ethnic lines and favo@@ red the tut@@ si in a deliber@@ ate - and successful - effort to divide society and fan res@@ ent@@ ment among hut@@ u leaders .
second , the bloo@@ dy 195@@ 9 revolution in r@@ wand@@ a , a country mir@@ ror@@ ing bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s ethnic and social structure , in@@ duc@@ ed bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s tut@@ si to cling even more tigh@@ tly to power .
at the same time , bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s hut@@ u saw r@@ wand@@ a as a role model and believed their ethnic majority should guarantee them de facto control of the country .
third , successive governments wi@@ dened the ethnic divide through catastro@@ ph@@ ically pre@@ dat@@ ory governance .
a tiny elite of tut@@ si from the southern province of bur@@ ur@@ i controlled all institutions , explo@@ iting them to the ful@@ l@@ est .
the army brut@@ ally sup@@ pressed any opposition to bur@@ ur@@ i rule .
no surprise , then , that millions of bur@@ un@@ di@@ ans felt alien@@ ated , and that many res@@ or@@ ted to violence .
in oc@@ tober 1993 , the killing by members of the army of mel@@ chi@@ or n@@ d@@ ad@@ ay@@ e , the first civilian , hut@@ u , non-@@ bur@@ ur@@ i , and democratically elected president provo@@ ked a bloo@@ dy reaction by the hut@@ u .
presidential ass@@ assin@@ ations do not necessarily lead to civil wars , but in bur@@ undi , a large-scale mass@@ ac@@ re of tut@@ si civilians by hut@@ u immediately followed the coup attempt .
f@@ ear@@ ing retri@@ bution by the tut@@ si@@ -@@ dominated army , large numbers of hut@@ u fl@@ ed the country while armed re@@ bels engaged the army .
for the first time , the army failed to cr@@ ush the re@@ bel@@ lion .
as a result , the tut@@ si@@ -@@ dominated government entered into negotiations with hut@@ u leaders , which led to the signing of a political acc@@ ord in aug@@ ust 2000 .
but the acc@@ ord had a major f@@ law : the absence of a ceas@@ e-@@ fire .
violence only rec@@ eded in 2003 , when the main re@@ bel group , the forces pour la dé@@ f@@ ense de la dé@@ mo@@ c@@ rati@@ e ( f@@ dd ) , concluded a political and military acc@@ ord with the government .
currently , in@@ security is confined to the area surrounding bu@@ jum@@ bur@@ a , the capital , where the forces nationales de li@@ b@@ é@@ ration , a small radical group , continue to fight .
there are strong indications that even this group is seeking compromise .
these break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s came about thanks to the dedicated mediation of mand@@ ela and zu@@ ma .
the presiden@@ ts of ug@@ anda and tan@@ z@@ ania , and the international community in general , also ex@@ er@@ ted leverage .
( bur@@ undi is an ai@@ d-@@ dependent country , so donors have considerable s@@ way in influ@@ encing its rul@@ ers &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; behavior . )
the question now is whether each party will honor its commitments .
what guarantees exist that the re@@ bel groups will fully demo@@ bi@@ li@@ ze ?
why should the re@@ bels believe that the government will honor its commitments once they no longer represent a threat ?
neither party , it seems , can commit credi@@ bly to peace .
bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s donors need to join hands with afri@@ can leaders to make certain that the agreements are implemented .
everyone agrees that recent ple@@ dges of a $ 1 billion in aid are a sign that donors are ready to show bur@@ un@@ di@@ ans that peace has a divi@@ dend .
but aid will help build peace only if it is carefully used .
it must be distributed to the ne@@ edy rather than favor@@ ing the elite - a tendency established in the past .
yet it would be dangerous to red@@ ress past imbalances solely at the expense of traditional beneficiaries , especially because they remain powerful enough to der@@ ail the peace process .
it is encouraging to note that bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s leaders have so far managed to integrate leaders from the opposition and re@@ bel groups into the country &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s political and military institutions without dis@@ missing inc@@ um@@ ben@@ ts .
the danger is that applying this approach rigor@@ ously will inv@@ ari@@ ably result in a blo@@ ated civil service and army .
but while down@@ si@@ zing government may be fashi@@ onable in the west , now is not the time for sli@@ mming down bur@@ undi &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s state sector .
for once , over employment is politically justified .
the international community must understand that the political benefits of not alien@@ ating the old elite while offering new opportunities to traditionally excluded groups ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the financial cost .
bur@@ undi will need even deeper po@@ ckets from its donors to transform today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s political over@@ tures into sustainable peace .
all stimulus roads lead to ch@@ ina
bei@@ jing – now that the “ green shoo@@ ts ” of recovery have with@@ ered , the debate over fiscal stimulus is back with a ven@@ ge@@ ance .
in the united states , those who argue for another stimulus package observe that it was always w@@ ish@@ ful thinking to believe that a $ 7@@ 87 billion package could offset a $ 3 tril@@ lion fall in private spending .
combine this with the continued fall in housing prices , and it is understandable that consumer spending remains de@@ pressed .
the banks , having been rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ zed only to the extent necessary to keep them af@@ lo@@ at , still have weak balance sheets .
mean@@ while , state governments , seeing revenues fall as a result of lower tax@@ able incomes last year , are cutting back like mad .
if there was a case for additional stimulus back in f@@ ebru@@ ary , that case is even stronger now .
but the case against additional stimulus is also strong .
the us federal deficit is an alarming 12 % of g@@ d@@ p , and public debt as a share of national income is already projected to double , to 80 % of g@@ d@@ p .
the idea that the us can grow out of its debt burden , as did fin@@ land and s@@ weden following their financial crises in the 1990 ’ s , seems un@@ realistic .
given all this , more deficit spending will only sto@@ ke fears of higher future taxes and inflation .
it will encourage the re@@ emergence of global imbalances .
and it will not re@@ assure consumers or investors .
it is possible to argue the economics both ways , but the politics all point in one direction .
the us congress lacks the st@@ om@@ ach for another stimulus package .
it has already faced intense criticism for its failure to get the country ’ s fiscal house in order .
the slow@@ ness with which the first stimulus has been rolled out , and the fact that it will take even more time for its full effects to be felt , provides more fo@@ d@@ der for the ch@@ at@@ tering classes .
dis@@ appointment over the effects of the tar@@ p has already destroyed popular – and con@@ gres@@ sional – support for more public money to rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ ze the banks .
so , even those who find the economic logic of arguments for fiscal activis@@ m comp@@ elling must acknowledge that the politics are not suppor@@ tive .
a second stimulus simply is not in the cards .
if there is going to be more aggreg@@ ate demand , it can come from only one place .
that place is not europ@@ e or jap@@ an , where debts are even higher than in the us – and the demographic pre@@ conditions for servi@@ cing them less favor@@ able .
rather , it is emerging markets like ch@@ ina .
the problem is that ch@@ ina has already done a lot to stimulate domestic demand , both through government spending and by direc@@ ting its banks to lend .
as a result , its stock market is fro@@ thy , and it is experiencing an alarming property boom .
through may , property prices were up 18 % year on year .
the obvious way to square this circle is to spend more on imports .
ch@@ ina can purchase more industrial machinery , transport equipment , and ste@@ el@@ making material , which are among its leading imports from the us .
direc@@ ting spending toward imports of capital equipment would avoid over@@ heating ch@@ ina ’ s own markets , boost the economy ’ s productive capacity ( and thus its ability to grow in the future ) , and support demand for us , europ@@ ean , and jap@@ anese products just when such support is needed most .
this strategy is not without risks .
allowing the ren@@ min@@ bi to appreciate as a way of encouraging imports may also dis@@ courage exports , the traditional motor of chin@@ ese growth .
and lower@@ ing administrative barriers to imports might re@@ direct more spending toward foreign goods than the authorities intend .
the question is what ch@@ ina will get in return .
and the answer brings us back , full circle , to where we started , namely to us fiscal policy .
ch@@ ina is worried that its more than $ 1 tril@@ lion investment in us treas@@ ury securities will not hold its value .
it wants re@@ assurance that the us will stand behind its debts .
it therefore wants to see a credible program for balancing the us budget once the recession ends .
and , tough talk not@@ with@@ standing , the ob@@ ama administration has yet to offer a credible road@@ map for fiscal consolidation .
doing so would re@@ assure ameri@@ can taxpayers worried about current deficits .
just as importantly , it would re@@ assure chin@@ ese policymakers .
we live in a multi@@ pol@@ ar world where neither the us nor ch@@ ina is large enough to exercise global economic leadership on its own .
but for this to be toler@@ able , the us needs to relie@@ ve ch@@ ina of existing risks .
only by working together can the two countries lead the world economy out of its current dol@@ dru@@ ms .
all the qu@@ een ’ s children
new y@@ or@@ k – does mon@@ arch@@ y – constitutional mon@@ arch@@ y , that is , not the des@@ po@@ tic kind – have any re@@ de@@ em@@ ing features left ?
the arguments against maintaining k@@ ings and que@@ ens are mostly quite rational .
it is un@@ reasonable in this democratic age to pay special de@@ ference to people solely on the basis of their birth .
are we really supposed to admire and love modern mon@@ arch@@ ies , such as the bri@@ tish house of win@@ ds@@ or , even more so today , just because some new pr@@ inc@@ ess has been p@@ lu@@ cked from the middle class ?
mon@@ arch@@ y has an inf@@ anti@@ liz@@ ing effect .
witness how otherwise sensible adults are reduced to ner@@ v@@ ously gr@@ inning sy@@ cop@@ han@@ ts when they are granted the privi@@ lege of tou@@ ching an extended ro@@ yal hand .
at great mon@@ arch@@ ical displays , such as the ro@@ yal wedding in lon@@ don , millions become enth@@ r@@ alled by chil@@ d-@@ like dreams of a “ fair@@ y-@@ t@@ ale ” marriage .
the my@@ sti@@ que of immense wealth , noble birth , and great exclu@@ siv@@ ity is further sustained by the global mass media that promote these rit@@ u@@ als .
now , one might argue that the dig@@ ni@@ fied p@@ om@@ p of qu@@ een eli@@ z@@ abeth ii is prefer@@ able to the ta@@ w@@ dry gran@@ di@@ osity of sil@@ vio ber@@ lus@@ coni , ma@@ d@@ onna , or cris@@ ti@@ ano ron@@ al@@ do .
in fact , the bri@@ tish mon@@ arch@@ y , especially , has been re@@ inv@@ enting itself by adopting many of the most vul@@ gar features of modern show@@ bi@@ z or sports celeb@@ r@@ ity .
and the worlds of ro@@ y@@ alty and popular f@@ ame often overla@@ p .
for example , da@@ vi@@ d be@@ ck@@ ham and his ex-@@ pop@@ -@@ star wife vic@@ t@@ oria , live out their own dream of ro@@ y@@ alty , ap@@ ing some of its gau@@ dies@@ t aspects .
they also happened to be among the favo@@ red guests at the latest ro@@ yal wedding .
simil@@ arly , while b@@ rit@@ ain has many outstanding musicians , the favorite of the ro@@ yal court is el@@ ton j@@ oh@@ n .
inf@@ anti@@ le or not , there is a common human cra@@ ving for taking vic@@ arious pleasure in the lives of k@@ ings , que@@ ens , and other sh@@ ining stars .
to call these people ’ s ost@@ ent@@ ati@@ ous displays of ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ance wa@@ ste@@ ful is to miss the point : a world of gl@@ it@@ tering dreams that must remain entirely beyond our gras@@ p is precisely what many people want to see .
but there is another , dark@@ er side to this cra@@ ving , which is the wish to see id@@ ols dra@@ gged through the mu@@ d in vi@@ cious go@@ ssi@@ p magazines , di@@ vor@@ ce courts , and so on .
this is the ven@@ ge@@ ful side of our fa@@ wn@@ ing , as though the hum@@ ili@@ ation of wor@@ shipping id@@ ols must be balanced by our deli@@ ght in their down@@ fall .
indeed , to subject people who are born into ro@@ yal families , or people who mar@@ ry into them , to lives in a f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l , where they are on constant display , like actors and act@@ res@@ ses in a continuous so@@ ap opera , where human relations are distor@@ ted and stun@@ ted by absurd rules of protocol , is a terrible form of cru@@ el@@ ty .
the current jap@@ anese em@@ press and her dau@@ gh@@ ter@@ -in-@@ law , both from non-@@ ar@@ isto@@ c@@ ratic families , have had ner@@ vous break@@ down@@ s as a result .
likewise , movie stars often fall victim to alcohol , drugs , and break@@ down@@ s , but at least they have chosen the lives they live .
k@@ ings and que@@ ens , on the whole , have not .
prin@@ ce char@@ les might have been far happ@@ ier as a gar@@ dener , but this was never an option .
one thing to be said for mon@@ ar@@ chs is that they provide people with a sense of continuity , which can be useful in times of crisis or radical change .
the king of sp@@ ain provided stability and continuity after the end of fran@@ co ’ s dictatorship .
during world war ii , europ@@ ean mon@@ ar@@ chs kept a sense of hope and unity alive among their subjects under n@@ az@@ i occupation .
but there is something else , too .
mon@@ arch@@ ies are often popular with minorities .
je@@ ws were among the most lo@@ yal subjects of the au@@ stro@@ -@@ hung@@ arian em@@ peror .
fran@@ z jo@@ se@@ ph i stood up for his je@@ wish subjects when they were threatened by german anti-@@ sem@@ ites .
to him , je@@ ws , ger@@ mans , cz@@ ech@@ s , or hung@@ ari@@ ans were all his subjects , wherever they lived , from the smallest g@@ ali@@ cian sh@@ te@@ t@@ l to the grand capit@@ als of bu@@ dap@@ est or vi@@ enn@@ a .
this offered some protection to minorities at a time of rising ethnic nation@@ alism .
in this sense , mon@@ arch@@ y is a little like is@@ lam , or the ca@@ tho@@ lic church : all belie@@ vers are supposed to be equal in the eyes of go@@ d , or the pop@@ e , or the em@@ peror – hence the appeal to the poor and the margin@@ alized .
this might explain some right-@@ wing popul@@ ists ’ anim@@ us against mon@@ arch@@ y .
the dut@@ ch popul@@ ist leader ge@@ ert wil@@ ders , for example , has den@@ ounced qu@@ een be@@ at@@ rix on several occasions as a le@@ f@@ ti@@ st , e@@ liti@@ st , and multi@@ cultur@@ alist .
like the new wave of popul@@ ists worldwide , wil@@ ders promises to take his country back for his fol@@ lo@@ wers , to stop immigration ( especially of mus@@ li@@ ms ) , and to make the ne@@ ther@@ lands dut@@ ch again , whatever that means .
be@@ at@@ rix , like fran@@ z jo@@ se@@ ph , ref@@ uses to make ethnic or religious distinc@@ tions between her subjects .
that is what she means when she pre@@ aches tolerance and mutual understanding .
to wil@@ ders and his supporters , this is a sign of her m@@ oll@@ y-@@ co@@ dd@@ ling of ali@@ ens , of appe@@ asing mus@@ li@@ ms .
to them , the qu@@ een seems almost anti-@@ dut@@ ch .
to be sure , like all europ@@ ean ro@@ yal families , the origins of the dut@@ ch ro@@ yal family are deci@@ de@@ dly mixed .
the emergence of k@@ ings and que@@ ens as specifically national fig@@ ure@@ heads is a relatively recent historical development .
emp@@ ires contained many nations , after all .
qu@@ een vic@@ t@@ oria , mostly of german blood , did not regard herself as a mon@@ arch of b@@ rit@@ ons alone , but of indi@@ ans , mal@@ ays , and many other peoples , too .
this ar@@ isto@@ c@@ ratic tradition of standing above the narrow stra@@ ins of ethnic nation@@ alism may be the best argument to hang on to ro@@ y@@ alty a little longer .
now that many europ@@ ean nations have become increasingly mixed in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city and culture , the only way forward is to learn to live together .
if mon@@ ar@@ chs can teach their subjects to do so , then let us give at least one che@@ er for the remaining k@@ ings and que@@ ens .
new y@@ or@@ k – the countries known collecti@@ vely as the pi@@ ig@@ s – portu@@ gal , i@@ reland , ital@@ y , gre@@ ece , and sp@@ ain – are bur@@ dened with increasingly un@@ sustainable levels of public and private debt . several of the wor@@ st-@@ hit – portu@@ gal , i@@ reland , and gre@@ ece – have seen their borro@@ wing costs so@@ ar to record high@@ s in recent weeks , even after their loss of market access led to ba@@ il@@ outs financed by the europ@@ ean union and the international monetary fund .
span@@ ish borro@@ wing costs are also rising .
gre@@ ece is clearly in@@ sol@@ vent .
even with a dra@@ con@@ ian austerity package , total@@ ing 10 % of g@@ d@@ p , its public debt would rise to 160 % of g@@ d@@ p .
portu@@ gal – where growth has been stag@@ n@@ ant for a decade – is experiencing a s@@ low-@@ motion fiscal train w@@ rec@@ k that will lead to public-@@ sector in@@ solvency .
in i@@ reland and sp@@ ain , transfer@@ ring the banking system ’ s huge losses to the government ’ s balance sheet – on top of al@@ read@@ y-@@ escal@@ ating public debt – will eventually lead to sovereign in@@ solvency .
the official approach , plan a , has been to pre@@ tend that these economies suffer a liquidity c@@ run@@ ch , not a solvency problem , and that the provision of ba@@ il@@ out loans – together with fiscal austerity and structural reforms – can restore debt sustainability and market access .
this “ extend and pre@@ tend ” or “ lend and pra@@ y ” approach is bound to fail , because , unfortunately , most of the options that in@@ deb@@ ted countries have used in the past to ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ate themselves from excessive debt are not feasible .
for example , the time-@@ hon@@ ored solution of printing money and escap@@ ing debt via inflation is un@@ available to the pi@@ ig@@ s , because they are tra@@ pped in the eurozone stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et .
the only institution that can c@@ rank up the printing press – the europ@@ ean central bank – will never resort to mon@@ eti@@ zation of fiscal deficits .
nor can we expect rapid g@@ d@@ p growth to save these countries .
the pi@@ ig@@ s ’ debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is next to impossible .
moreover , whatever economic growth some of these countries might eventually register is contin@@ gent on en@@ acting politically un@@ popular reforms that will work only in the long run – and at the cost of even more short-term pain .
to restore growth , these countries must also reg@@ ain competitiveness by achieving a real de@@ preci@@ ation of their currency , thus turning trade deficits into sur@@ pl@@ uses .
but a rising euro – pushed higher by exc@@ essively early monetary tigh@@ tening by the ec@@ b – implies more real appreciation , further undermining competitiveness .
the german solution to this con@@ und@@ rum – keeping wage growth below that of productivity , thereby reducing unit labor costs – took more than a decade to yield results .
if the pi@@ ig@@ s started that process today , the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth .
the last option – de@@ flation of wages and prices – to reduce costs , achieve a real de@@ preci@@ ation , and restore competitiveness is associated with ever-@@ deepening recession .
the real de@@ preci@@ ation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher , making them even more un@@ sustainable .
lower@@ ing private and public consumption in order to boost private savings , and implementing fiscal austerity to reduce private and public debts , aren ’ t options , either .
the private sector can spend less and save more , but this would entail an immediate cost known as ke@@ yn@@ es ’ parado@@ x of thri@@ ft : declining economic output and rising debt as a share of g@@ d@@ p .
recent studies by the im@@ f and others suggest that raising taxes , cutting subsidies , and reducing government spending – even in@@ efficient spending – would sti@@ f@@ le growth in the short term , exacerb@@ ating the underlying debt problem .
if the pi@@ ig@@ s can ’ t infl@@ ate , grow , de@@ value , or save their way out of their problems , plan a is either failing or is bound to fail .
the only alternative is to shift quickly to plan b – an order@@ ly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries ’ governments , households , and banks .
this can happen in a number of ways .
one can carry out an order@@ ly re@@ schedul@@ ing of the pi@@ ig@@ s ’ public debts without actually reducing the principal amount o@@ wed .
this means extending the mat@@ urity dates of debts and reducing the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently un@@ sustainable market rates .
this solution limits the risk of con@@ ta@@ gion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of debt principal were reduced .
policymakers should also consider innovations used to help deb@@ t-@@ bur@@ dened developing countries in the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s .
for example , bon@@ d@@ holders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for g@@ d@@ p-@@ linked bonds , which offer pay@@ outs pe@@ gged to future economic growth .
in effect , these instruments turn credi@@ tors into shareholders in a country ’ s economy , entit@@ ling them to a portion of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden .
reducing the face value of mort@@ g@@ ages and providing the up@@ side – in case home prices were to rise in the long run – to the credi@@ tor banks is another way to convert mort@@ gage debt partly into share@@ holder equity .
bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity , which would both aver@@ t a government take@@ over of banks and prevent soci@@ alization of bank losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis .
europ@@ e cannot afford to continue thro@@ wing money at the problem and pra@@ ying that growth and time will bring sal@@ v@@ ation .
no one will des@@ c@@ end from the heav@@ ens , de@@ us ex mach@@ ina , to ba@@ il out the im@@ f or the eu .
the credi@@ tors and bon@@ d@@ holders who l@@ ent the money in the first place must carry their share of the burden , for the sake of the pi@@ ig@@ s , the eu , and their own bottom lines .
a long mar@@ ch with ch@@ ina
he assured chin@@ ese leaders that the united states is committed to hon@@ oring all its debts , despite its recent credit down@@ grade ; he talked enthusias@@ tically about us-@@ ch@@ ina inter@@ dependence ; and he show@@ c@@ ased his grand@@ daughter , who has studied chin@@ ese for several years , as a future bridge between the two countries .
but , behind all the sm@@ iles and ban@@ quet to@@ asts , serious issues and perception gaps continue to divide the world ’ s two great powers .
for star@@ ters , there is always an attitude problem .
to those who view ch@@ ina ’ s rise in a negative light , the country is simply becoming ever more arro@@ gan@@ t .
it is getting tough in its territorial disputes with jap@@ an in the east ch@@ ina sea ; it is becoming asser@@ tive in the south ch@@ ina sea with its neigh@@ b@@ ors , also over disp@@ uted islands ; it put its own ste@@ alth figh@@ ter on display during the us defense secret@@ ary ’ s visit to ch@@ ina ; it is sending its first aircraft carrier out to sea for trials , indicating the possibility of establishing nav@@ al bases in the indi@@ an ocean .
even a bra@@ w@@ l between the chin@@ ese and a visiting ameri@@ can bas@@ ket@@ ball team is viewed as evidence of ch@@ ina ’ s aggressive behavior .
many chin@@ ese , on the other hand , tend to think that the us is suffering from severe case of conc@@ eit@@ ed super@@ power syn@@ dro@@ me .
as these chin@@ ese see it , the us has a rather d@@ ys@@ functional government , but nevertheless ins@@ ists that its political and economic system is the best in the world , and that everyone should em@@ ul@@ ate it .
it is heavily in debt , but cannot stop spending and borro@@ wing .
it is no longer competitive in manufacturing , but bl@@ ames others for its huge trade deficit .
and the world ’ s only military super@@ power is often seen within ch@@ ina as trig@@ ger-@@ happy when interven@@ ing in other countries ’ internal affairs .
then , there is the issue of trust .
ch@@ ina ’ s critics argue that its claims to a peaceful rise are not credible , given the country ’ s non-@@ democratic , one-@@ party system .
any chin@@ ese military move is portra@@ yed as an expan@@ sion@@ ary and aggressive act that must be contained .
any attempts at engagement by western politicians , such as bi@@ den ’ s recent trip , are automatically met with doubt and criticism for co@@ z@@ ying up to dict@@ ators .
likewise , for those chin@@ ese who are suspici@@ ous of us intentions , con@@ spi@@ racy is always in play .
they see a declining super@@ power using economic , military , and diplomatic means in an un@@ rel@@ enting effort to prevent ch@@ ina ’ s rise .
talk of human rights and democracy is nothing but a smoke screen for demon@@ izing ch@@ ina .
arms sales to ta@@ i@@ wan , ti@@ bet@@ an activis@@ m , and “ color revolu@@ tions ” of various kinds are all spon@@ sored by the us and other western powers , and are aimed at weak@@ ening ch@@ ina .
despite decades of close interaction , with millions of ameri@@ cans , europ@@ e@@ ans , and jap@@ anese visiting ch@@ ina every year and similar numbers of chin@@ ese now visiting the us and other advanced countries , both sides see each other through a glass dark@@ ly .
increased inter@@ dependence has not led to better understand@@ ings on even some of the most basic issues .
ch@@ ina ’ s vice minister of foreign affairs fu ying expressed her country ’ s anxi@@ ety about this state of affairs in a recent interview . “ the most important thing is the question of whether ch@@ ina and the us are enemies .
are we preparing for a war against each other ? ” bi@@ den , while reaffir@@ ming that the us does not view ch@@ ina as an enemy , imp@@ lied that fu ’ s wor@@ ries are not fan@@ ci@@ ful , saying that the worst scenario is a mis@@ understanding that leads to an un@@ intended conflict .
so the key issue for ch@@ ina , its neigh@@ b@@ ors , the us , and rest of the world is not how many aircraft carriers , missi@@ les , sub@@ mar@@ ines , and ne@@ x@@ t-@@ generation figh@@ ters ch@@ ina may produce and deplo@@ y in the coming years and decades .
rather , it is how ch@@ ina intends to use its newly acquired economic and military strength in pursuing its domestic and foreign@@ -@@ policy goals – and how the world ’ s leading powers can ensure that they do not end up har@@ ming each other by accident or mis@@ understanding .
to meet these challenges successfully , there is no viable alternative to a positive , continuous , and fran@@ k engagement between ch@@ ina and the rest of the world .
the chin@@ ese economy will continue to grow ; the chin@@ ese military will continue to moderni@@ ze ; and the chin@@ ese people will remain united in their great power aspirations .
a cold war@@ -@@ style confron@@ tation and con@@ tainment policy from the west will be met with strong resistance from the chin@@ ese , whose global leverage , particularly in finance , cannot be ignored .
only a patient , creative , and consistent engagement strategy will mitig@@ ate fears on both sides .
ch@@ ina ’ s rise is a fact ; the en@@ during peac@@ e@@ fulness of that rise must be a priority for ch@@ ina , its neigh@@ b@@ ors , the west , and , most importantly , the us .
a lo@@ oming anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants crisis
the widespread pres@@ cription of drugs for troub@@ led minds has always ended badly , right back to the days of op@@ i@@ ates and co@@ ca@@ ine , up through bro@@ mi@@ des , bar@@ bit@@ ur@@ ates , and tranqui@@ liz@@ ers : all proved to be highly addi@@ c@@ tive drugs , but only after years of den@@ ial did doctors admit that this was so .
the past decade has seen a three-@@ fold increase in pres@@ crip@@ tions .
it is now clear that today &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants are not the wonder drugs they were tou@@ ted as being .
the sometimes in@@ toler@@ able withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants also ex@@ pose many users to severe and de@@ pressing side effects : substantial weight gain , loss of li@@ bi@@ do , and mood changes , to name just the most common complaints .
suspici@@ ons about such proble@@ ms@@ --@@ especially about dru@@ g-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed suici@@ dal behavior and sensi@@ tiz@@ ation to de@@ pres@@ sion@@ --@@ have been rum@@ bling for years , but searching scientific investigations have only just begun .
an important inquiry set up by the united king@@ dom &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s drug regulators in mid-@@ 2003 will soon report its findings .
they will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-@@ print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s use .
this may help , it but won &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ t address the real issue : how could regulators have allowed this problem to rec@@ ur after so much bit@@ ter experience , and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves ?
on the rich@@ ter scale of drug disasters , the lo@@ oming anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11 , where th@@ ali@@ dom@@ i@@ de rates a 10 .
time will tell , but the key point is this : the th@@ ali@@ dom@@ i@@ de disaster of the 1950 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s and 1960 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s happened because there was no independent control of drug safety , whereas the anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant crisis has grown under the a@@ eg@@ is of an elabor@@ ate , expensive , and global regulatory system .
the nu@@ b of the anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm , but that they were allowed to do so when the prece@@ dents were so plain .
if and when this crisis is ever properly investigated , it will not so much open a can of pharmac@@ ological wor@@ ms , as ex@@ pose questions about what medicine is and should be .
these underlying issues seem all the more important because the internet has for several years been gro@@ an@@ ing with evidence of the crisis to come .
the explo@@ sive growth of the internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering , presenting , and communic@@ ating evidence .
it bro@@ a@@ dened and deep@@ ened understanding of the problems associated with anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants , giving patients a collective voice , as never before .
previously , drug safety monitoring re@@ lied on occa@@ sional adverse reports from health professionals about patients &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; reaction to medicines .
but this crisis revealed these reports &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; fundamental in@@ adequ@@ acies , such that users &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; experiences with drugs can never credi@@ bly be ignored again .
united by the internet , many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that b@@ ore little resem@@ bl@@ ance to the labels &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; warnings .
the impact of this user intelligence has been profound : in 2003 , one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the inci@@ dence of withdrawal reactions from 0.@@ 2 % to 25 % ( even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; not hab@@ it forming &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; at all ) .
the anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant crisis provides , for the first time , dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk .
to be sure , user reports are not &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; scientific &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and most , individually , might seem na@@ ï@@ ve , conf@@ used , exag@@ ger@@ ated , mis@@ taken , and / or just plain self-@@ absor@@ bed .
yet in this case they provided , collecti@@ vely , more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials .
so , now the question is not so much the value of patients &@@ a@@ pos@@ ; reports , but the integrity of medical research and the state of science .
&@@ quo@@ t@@ ; just how tain@@ ted has clinical medicine become , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; asked an edi@@ torial in the bri@@ tish medical journ@@ al the lan@@ c@@ et in 2002 ; the answer was &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; heavily and dam@@ ag@@ ingly so . &@@ quo@@ t@@ ;
the dup@@ licity surrounding the marketing of anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant drugs under@@ sco@@ res just how cor@@ rupt the profession has become .
the crisis now un@@ fol@@ ding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science , the relationship between risk and benefit , and the conflict between imper@@ atives of trade and health .
but one feature above all others cap@@ tures the underlying problem : the y@@ a@@ wn@@ ing gap between the words of patients who speak their minds and the termin@@ ology of producers , experts , and authorities who min@@ ce words .
the 1990 &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ s saw &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; de@@ pression &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; formally re@@ defined as a ser@@ o@@ ton@@ in-@@ defici@@ ency disease and the s@@ cour@@ ge of milli@@ ons@@ --@@ a convenient and se@@ duc@@ tive view , but deeply simpl@@ istic .
the term &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; drug dependence &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; was also re@@ defined , to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting .
the u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous term &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dis@@ continuation symptoms &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; --@@ or@@ wel@@ lian new@@ speak for with@@ dra@@ wal@@ --@@ imp@@ lied that anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants carried no risk of dependence .
on the contrary , w@@ ish@@ ful thinking led experts to ad@@ duce &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; dis@@ continuation symptoms &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies .
later , suici@@ des became rout@@ inely described as &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; non-@@ acci@@ dental over@@ do@@ ses , &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; and the broad@@ -@@ spectrum term &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; emotional l@@ ability &@@ quo@@ t@@ ; came into vo@@ gue , despite its in@@ ability to distinguish between a dru@@ g-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed suici@@ de attempt and an out@@ bur@@ st of te@@ ars .
by contrast , user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality , rather than promote images that suit the vest@@ ed interests involved .
in the long run , the anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ant crisis thus may prove to be a bl@@ essing in dis@@ gu@@ ise , but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honest@@ y needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve .
alpine sch@@ a@@ den@@ freu@@ de
not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , the atmosphere at this year ’ s world economic forum was gri@@ m .
those who think that globalization , technology , and the market economy will solve the world ’ s problems seemed sub@@ du@@ ed .
most ch@@ ast@@ ened of all were the ban@@ kers .
against the backdrop of the sub-@@ prime crisis , the disasters at many financial institutions , and the weak@@ ening of the stock market , these “ masters of the universe ” seemed less om@@ nis@@ ci@@ ent than they did a short while ago .
and it was not just the ban@@ kers who were in the da@@ vos do@@ gh@@ ouse this year , but also their regulators – the central ban@@ kers .
anyone who goes to international conferences is used to hearing ameri@@ cans lec@@ ture everyone else about transparency .
there was still some of that at da@@ vos .
i heard the usual suspec@@ ts – including a former treas@@ ury secret@@ ary who had been particularly vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous in such ad@@ mon@@ ish@@ ments during the east a@@ sia crisis – b@@ ang on about the need for transparency at sovereign wealth funds ( though not at ameri@@ can or europ@@ ean he@@ dge funds ) .
but this time , developing countries could not resist commen@@ ting on the hypo@@ cris@@ y of it all . there was even a touch of sch@@ a@@ den@@ freu@@ de in the air about the problems the united states is having right now – though it was moder@@ ated , of course , by wor@@ ries about the down@@ turn ’ s impact on their own economies .
had ameri@@ ca really told others to bring in ameri@@ can banks to teach them about how to run their business ?
had ameri@@ ca really bo@@ ast@@ ed about its superior risk management systems , going so far as to develop a new regulatory system ( called bas@@ le ii ) ?
bas@@ le ii is dead – at least until memories of the current disaster fa@@ de .
ban@@ kers – and the rating agencies – believed in financial al@@ chem@@ y .
they thought that financial innovations could som@@ ehow turn bad mort@@ g@@ ages into good securities , mer@@ iting a@@ a@@ a rat@@ ings .
but one lesson of modern finance theory is that , in well functioning financial markets , re@@ packaging risks should not make much difference .
if we know the price of cream and the price of sk@@ im milk , we can figure out the price of milk with 1 % cream , 2 % cream , or 4 % cream .
there might be some money in re@@ packaging , but not the billions that banks made by s@@ lic@@ ing and di@@ cing sub-@@ prime mort@@ g@@ ages into packages whose value was much greater than their contents .
it seemed too good to be true – and it was .
worse , banks failed to understand the first principle of risk management : diversification only works when risks are not cor@@ related , and macro-@@ sho@@ cks ( such as those that affect housing prices or borro@@ wers ’ ability to re@@ pay ) affect the prob@@ ability of default for all mort@@ g@@ ages .
i argued at da@@ vos that central ban@@ kers also got it wrong by mis@@ jud@@ ging the threat of a down@@ turn and failing to provide sufficient regulation .
they wa@@ ited too long to take action .
because it normally takes a year or more for the full effects of monetary policy to be felt , central banks need to act pre@@ emp@@ tively , not re@@ actively .
worse , the us federal reserve and its previous chairman , al@@ an gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an , may have helped create the problem , encouraging households to take on ris@@ ky vari@@ ab@@ le-@@ rate mort@@ g@@ ages by re@@ ass@@ uring those who worried about a housing bub@@ ble that there was at most a little “ fro@@ th ” in the market .
normally , a da@@ vos audience would r@@ ally to the support of the central ban@@ kers .
this time , a vote at the end of the session supported my view by a margin of three to one .
even the ple@@ a of one of central ban@@ ker that “ no one could have predic@@ ted the problems ” moved few in the audience – perhaps because several people sitting there had , like me , explicitly warned about the im@@ pending problem in previous years .
the only thing we got wrong was how bad banks ’ lending practices were , how non-@@ transparent banks really were , and how inadequate their risk management systems were .
it was interesting to see the different cultural attitudes to the crisis on display .
in jap@@ an , the ce@@ o of a major bank would have ap@@ ologi@@ zed to his employees and his country , and would have refused his pension and bonus so that those who suffered as a result of corporate failures could share the money .
he would have re@@ signed .
in ameri@@ ca , the only questions are whether a board will force a ce@@ o to leave and , if so , how big his sever@@ ance package will be .
when i asked one ce@@ o whether there was any discussion of returning their bon@@ uses , the response was not just no , but an aggressive defense of the bonus system .
this is the third us crisis in the past 20 years , after the savings &@@ amp@@ ; loan crisis of 1989 and the en@@ ron / wor@@ ld@@ com crisis in 2002 .
dereg@@ ulation has not worked .
un@@ fet@@ tered markets may produce big bon@@ uses for ce@@ o ’ s , but they do not lead , as if by an inv@@ isi@@ ble hand , to soci@@ etal well-being .
until we achieve a better balance between markets and government , the world will continue to pay a high price .
alternatives to alternative energy
vir@@ g@@ inia beach – the problem of long-term energy sources has been dri@@ fting towards crisis for decades .
indeed , the catastro@@ ph@@ es in jap@@ an might finally achieve what decades of conflict in the middle east have not : comp@@ el governments to invest in the research required to develop viable energy alternatives .
the immediate political response to the jap@@ anese disaster will be to make small re-@@ adjustments among known energy sources , including wind and solar .
but the current options that many governments wish to embra@@ ce will not do the job .
production of the materials used to capture and store solar electricity , for example , can cause just as much environmental damage as conventional fuels , and existing wind and solar technology cannot easily meet the needs of large populations .
of course , fossil fuels , mainly coal and natural gas , remain important , but their extra@@ ction and use is tied to ground@@ water pollution and car@@ b@@ on-@@ dioxide emissions , especially in north ameri@@ ca and ch@@ ina .
the tragedy in jap@@ an remin@@ ds us that , though nuclear energy em@@ its no co@@ 2 , it is toxic in other ways .
if there was ever a time for a massive investment in research into long-term energy sources , that time is now .
we need something on the scale of the man@@ hatt@@ an project ( which created the atom@@ ic bom@@ b ) , or the ap@@ oll@@ o program ( which put a man on the moon ) .
both initiatives succeeded in a short period of time and at a relatively low price .
in current dollars , each cost about $ 200 billion – a mere fra@@ ction of what the united states has paid for the i@@ ra@@ q war , and less than the cost imp@@ lied by the rise in oil prices over the past year .
both the ap@@ oll@@ o program and the man@@ hatt@@ an project had unique characteristics .
each mar@@ shal@@ ed the sharp@@ est minds from a range of countries to address one task .
tolerance for failure was sli@@ m in both initiatives , so they ten@@ ded to rely on the previous generation of scientific insight , because the resulting technology was more tru@@ st@@ worthy .
neither ent@@ ailed a great scientific challenge , but rather a vast engineering problem .
although in@@ vention was required , existing scientific methods were used .
unfortunately , governments now focus only on one aspect of this investment format , in which technology that is almost ready is funded .
but this results in endless efforts to make non-@@ ideal methods less troub@@ les@@ ome .
we need a game chan@@ ger , like the integrated circuit , radio , or electricity .
such a para@@ dig@@ m shift requires an ap@@ ol@@ lo@@ -@@ scale investment , but in basic science .
there are several examples of the kind of phenomena that , with the benefit of new insight , could lead to un@@ expected energy sources .
quite apart from daily sun@@ light , for instance , earth is bom@@ bar@@ ded by all sorts of other radiation from outside our solar system .
some of this we understand , but most of the material in the universe , and the forces associated with it , are not well explained .
there is most likely an explo@@ itable gal@@ ac@@ tic source of energy that is constant , unlimited , and in our sky right now .
without basic research to help us understand these forces , their potential will el@@ ude us .
an even more mysteri@@ ous effect occurs on earth with living cre@@ atures .
according to general laws of physi@@ cs , everything tends to dis@@ order – a process known as ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y . less well understood is why some agents do the opposite , ten@@ ding toward order and structure .
plants , for example , inter@@ act with their environment to produce locally ordered systems , resulting in the creation of wood ( and other biom@@ ass ) .
when we burn wood , we reverse the process , un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing that order and producing energy .
at this simple level , we understand how nature works .
but in more complex cases , in which living beings collabor@@ ate to build societies or create knowledge , our scientific models are inadequate .
this has promp@@ ted some scientists to begin investig@@ ating new models of energy from the perspective of “ intelligence and information , ” in which order is equivalent to information .
with such a fresh perspective on matter , new potenti@@ als could emerge .
for example , consider me@@ than@@ e cla@@ th@@ rate , an ic@@ e-@@ like stone that in most cases is built in an ordered way by a complex collaboration of micro@@ bes .
global deposits of me@@ than@@ e cla@@ th@@ rate contain more than twice the amount of energy of all known fossil fuels , and it can burn clean@@ ly .
if not bur@@ ned in a controlled way , the release of raw cla@@ th@@ rates into the atmosphere would represent a global climate threat , and past massive releases have been catastro@@ p@@ hic .
but a better understanding of biological “ information flow ” could help us use me@@ than@@ e cla@@ th@@ rate in ways that could actually counter global warming .
solutions such as these are not explo@@ red , however , because they are not within obviously immediate reach , as the atom@@ ic bom@@ b and the lun@@ ar landing were .
so , perhaps a radi@@ cally new approach to research is also needed .
given humanity ’ s common interest in new energy sources , it seems that the world ’ s bri@@ gh@@ test scientific minds should collabor@@ ate to identify them .
such a project would flour@@ ish in a scientific establishment that is mat@@ uring , rather than frozen in its methods .
whereas jap@@ an , the us , and europ@@ e are competent at research into what is almost known , the c@@ utt@@ ing-@@ edge science is more likely to emerge in an economy hung@@ ry for resources and infrastructure , such as ch@@ ina .
rather than a single laboratory , such a program could be a distributed virtual enterprise , taking advantage of the sort of innovative industrial collaboration in which ch@@ ina currently exc@@ els .
we need fundamental break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s in alternative energy sources , and soon .
getting them will probably require a large , collabor@@ ative effort focused on theoretical science . changing our approach to research in this way might seem more difficult than using what we already have .
but , as with our natural resources , we are running out of options .
alternatives to austerity
new y@@ or@@ k – in the after@@ math of the great recession , countries have been left with unprecedented peac@@ e@@ time deficits and increasing an@@ x@@ ieties about their growing national debts .
in many countries , this is leading to a new round of austerity – policies that will almost surely lead to weaker national and global economies and a marked slow@@ down in the pace of recovery .
those hoping for large deficit reductions will be so@@ rely disappointed , as the economic slow@@ down will push down tax revenues and increase demands for unemployment insurance and other social benefits .
the attempt to restra@@ in the growth of debt does serve to concentrate the mind – it forces countries to focus on priorities and assess values .
the united states is unlikely in the short term to embra@@ ce massive budget cuts , à la the united king@@ dom .
but the long-term progno@@ sis – made especially di@@ re by heal@@ th-@@ care reform ’ s in@@ ability to make much of a dent in rising medical costs – is sufficiently ble@@ ak that there is increasing bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an momentum to do something .
president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama has appointed a bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an defic@@ it-@@ reduction commission , whose chair@@ men recently provided a gli@@ mp@@ se of what their report might look like .
technically , reducing a deficit is a straight@@ forward matter : one must either cut expendi@@ tures or raise taxes .
it is already clear , however , that the defic@@ it-@@ reduction agenda , at least in the us , goes further : it is an attempt to weak@@ en social protec@@ tions , reduce the progres@@ siv@@ ity of the tax system , and shr@@ ink the role and size of government – all while leaving established interests , like the militar@@ y-@@ industrial complex , as little affected as possible .
in the us ( and some other advanced industrial countries ) , any defic@@ it-@@ reduction agenda has to be set in the context of what happened over the last decade :
· a massive increase in defense expendi@@ tures , fu@@ eled by two fruit@@ less wars , but going well beyond that ;
· growth in inequality , with the top 1 % gar@@ n@@ ering more than 20 % of the country ’ s income , accompanied by a weak@@ ening of the middle class – medi@@ an us household income has fallen by more than 5 % over the past decade , and was in decline even before the recession ;
· under@@ investment in the public sector , including in infrastructure , evi@@ den@@ ced so dramatically by the collapse of new or@@ le@@ ans ’ le@@ vies ; and
· growth in corporate welfare , from bank ba@@ il@@ outs to ethan@@ ol subsidies to a continuation of agricultural subsidies , even when those subsidies have been ruled illegal by the world trade organization .
as a result , it is relatively easy to formul@@ ate a defic@@ it-@@ reduction package that boo@@ sts efficiency , bol@@ sters growth , and reduces inequality .
five core ingredients are required .
first , spending on high-@@ return public investments should be increased .
even if this wi@@ dens the deficit in the short run , it will reduce the national debt in the long run .
what business w@@ ouldn ’ t j@@ ump at investment opportunities yiel@@ ding returns in excess of 10 % if it could bor@@ row capital – as the us government can – for less than 3 % interest ?
second , military expendi@@ tures must be cut – not just funding for the fruit@@ less wars , but also for the weapons that don ’ t work against enemies that don ’ t exist .
we ’ ve continued as if the cold war never came to an end , spending as much on defense as the rest of the world combined .
following this is the need to eliminate corporate welfare .
even as ameri@@ ca has stri@@ pped away its safety net for people , it has strengthened the safety net for firms , evi@@ den@@ ced so clearly in the great recession with the ba@@ il@@ outs of a@@ ig , gol@@ d@@ man sach@@ s , and other banks .
corporate welfare accounts for nearly one-@@ half of total income in some parts of us ag@@ ro-@@ business , with billions of dollars in cotton subsidies , for example , going to a few rich farmers – while lower@@ ing prices and increasing poverty among competitors in the developing world .
an especially eg@@ regi@@ ous form of corporate special treatment is that afford@@ ed to the drug companies .
even though the government is the largest buyer of their products , it is not allowed to negotiate prices , thereby fu@@ eling an estimated increase in corporate revenues – and costs to the government – appro@@ aching $ 1 tril@@ lion dollars over a decade .
another example is the sm@@ org@@ as@@ bor@@ d of special benefits provided to the energy sector , especially oil and gas , thereby simultaneously rob@@ bing the treas@@ ury , distor@@ ting resource allocation , and destroying the environment .
then there are the seem@@ ingly endless gi@@ ve@@ a@@ ways of national resources – from the free spectrum provided to broadcast@@ ers to the low ro@@ y@@ alties le@@ vi@@ ed on mining companies to the subsidies to l@@ um@@ ber companies .
creating a fairer and more efficient tax system , by eliminating the special treatment of capital gains and divi@@ den@@ ds , is also needed .
why should those who work for a living be subject to higher tax rates than those who re@@ ap their live@@ lihood from speculation ( often at the expense of others ) ?
finally , with more than 20 % of all income going to the top 1 % , a slight increase , say 5 % , in taxes actually paid would bring in more than $ 1 tril@@ lion over the course of a decade .
a defic@@ it-@@ reduction package cra@@ fted along these lines would more than meet even the most ar@@ dent deficit ha@@ w@@ k ’ s demands .
it would increase efficiency , promote growth , improve the environment , and benefit workers and the middle class .
there ’ s only one problem : it w@@ ouldn ’ t benefit those at the top , or the corporate and other special interests that have come to domin@@ ate ameri@@ ca ’ s policy@@ making .
its comp@@ elling logic is precisely why there is little chance that such a reasonable proposal would ever be adopted .
testing times for al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s
lon@@ don – al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s disease is by far the most common cause of de@@ men@@ tia and one of the world ’ s most fe@@ ared dis@@ orders .
by 2050 , there will be 135 million al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s suff@@ er@@ ers worldwide , a thre@@ e@@ fold increase from today , with three-@@ quarters of cases occurring in low@@ - and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income countries .
predic@@ ting the on@@ set of al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s , let alone preventing or c@@ uring it , remains an immense challenge .
al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s disease was identified more than a century ago from au@@ top@@ sy results that showed characteristic brain l@@ esi@@ ons called “ am@@ y@@ lo@@ id pla@@ ques . ”
the disease is more difficult to diagno@@ se in the living .
doctors rely on observation of memory loss and other thinking deficits ( such as reason@@ ing or language comprehen@@ sion ) – signs that pla@@ ques are already present in the brain .
but any cure would have to be administer@@ ed before the pla@@ ques form , and years before symptoms of de@@ men@@ tia appear .
al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s might be more predictable if scientists had the time and resources to conduct far-reaching long@@ itu@@ din@@ al studies over many years .
such studies ideally would involve blood , ima@@ ging , memory , and medical tests , as well as detailed lifestyle question@@ na@@ ires filled out by thousands of young and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ aged people .
study participants would be followed over decades to see who developed the disease , and which tests proved positive before al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s was diagno@@ sed .
in fact , two famous long@@ itu@@ din@@ al studies – the fra@@ m@@ ingham heart study in mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts and the k@@ ungsh@@ ol@@ men project in s@@ weden – have led to important progress in predic@@ ting the disease . these studies found that short-term memory may be im@@ pa@@ ired for up to ten years before an al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s diagnosis .
major advances have since been made in brain ima@@ ging , bio@@ chemical analysis , and , perhaps most important , genetic testing .
indeed , the risk of al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s doub@@ les if a parent or si@@ bling has it , probably due in large part to the presence of the a@@ po@@ e gene .
the risk tri@@ ples for europ@@ e@@ ans who inher@@ it a particular type of a@@ po@@ e , called ε@@ 4 ; inher@@ iting two copies of ε@@ 4 increases the risk roughly ten@@ fold .
but genetic testing alone is unlikely to be an accurate predic@@ tor , because around half of al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s suff@@ er@@ ers do not carry ε@@ 4 , and probably half of those with ε@@ 4 do not develop the disease .
moreover , though international studies of more than 70@@ ,000 people have found over 20 other genes linked to al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s , their impact is minimal .
that said , a ground@@ breaking 2012 study published in the new eng@@ land journ@@ al of medicine , analy@@ zed a rare genetic mut@@ ation found in just 500 families around the world , which would lead to al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s before the age of 50 .
the study showed which tests were able to pre@@ dict the outcome most accurately decades ahead of on@@ set .
the research found that am@@ y@@ lo@@ i@@ d-@@ bet@@ a – the substance that cl@@ um@@ ps together and forms am@@ y@@ lo@@ id pla@@ ques – becomes deple@@ ted in the cer@@ eb@@ ro@@ sp@@ in@@ al flu@@ id around the brain as long as 25 years before the on@@ set of de@@ men@@ tia .
fifteen years prior to on@@ set , a posit@@ ron emission tom@@ o@@ graphy ( pet ) scan showed am@@ y@@ lo@@ i@@ d-@@ bet@@ a being depos@@ ited in pla@@ ques in the brain itself .
and detailed short-term memory tests were ab@@ normal ten years before on@@ set , as suggested in the fra@@ m@@ ingham and k@@ ungsh@@ ol@@ men studies .
these tests are now becoming part of clinical practice , and are available commer@@ cially .
memory and other co@@ gni@@ tive tests can reveal whether one has minor problems with some aspects of thinking – a condition known as “ mild co@@ gni@@ tive im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment ” that prece@@ des al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s disease .
the problem is that the tests must be administer@@ ed by a trained ne@@ urop@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ist and take more than an hour to complete ; moreover , many people with mild co@@ gni@@ tive im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment do not progress to de@@ men@@ tia .
sam@@ pling cer@@ eb@@ ro@@ sp@@ in@@ al flu@@ id via a l@@ um@@ bar pun@@ c@@ ture ( or “ sp@@ in@@ al tap ” ) can pre@@ dict which people with mild co@@ gni@@ tive im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment will progress to de@@ men@@ tia with over 80 % accuracy , but this still means a mis@@ diagnosis for one in five patients .
pet sc@@ ans are slightly less accurate , while routine m@@ ri brain sc@@ ans can reveal with perhaps only 70 % accuracy sub@@ tle ab@@ norm@@ alities in people with mild co@@ gni@@ tive im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment .
scientists are therefore still searching for an accurate predic@@ tive test that is cheaper , quick@@ er , and less inv@@ a@@ sive than pet sc@@ ans or l@@ um@@ bar pun@@ c@@ tures .
this year , two small studies of blood tests seemed to pre@@ dict al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s 1-@@ 3 years before it occurred , but the tests are complicated and require the measurement of ten or more substances .
wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever predic@@ tive methods doctors use over the next few years will probably enable them to inform those patients with mild co@@ gni@@ tive im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment about their chances of developing al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s in the short term .
the tri@@ ck@@ ier question is whether we will be able to pre@@ dict al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s disease accurately in those with normal co@@ gni@@ tion and memory , or to pre@@ dict it more than five years in advance .
even if accurate early pre@@ diction of al@@ z@@ heimer ’ s eventually is achieved , there are currently no drugs available to prevent or cure it before the am@@ y@@ lo@@ id pla@@ ques start destroying the mind .
that will be our next great challenge .
a man against the machine
wash@@ ington , d@@ c ­ – ameri@@ ca ’ s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months – political strength , that is – by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table .
if we are still making any progress at all , it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of united states sen@@ ators .
most notable has been the work of sen@@ ator ted kauf@@ man , a democ@@ rat from del@@ aware ( yes , a pro-@@ business state ) , who has pressed ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to fix the most eg@@ regi@@ ous problems in the us financial sector .
kauf@@ man under@@ stands that successful reform requires three ingredients : arguments that persuade , the ability to bring colleagues along , and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time .
on two fron@@ ts , kauf@@ man has – against long od@@ ds – actually managed to make substantial steps .
long before it became fashi@@ onable , kauf@@ man persist@@ ed with the idea that the us real estate boom was fu@@ eled in part by per@@ va@@ sive fraud within the mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ sec@@ uri@@ tiz@@ ation-@@ derivatives complex , effectively at the heart of wall street .
this thesis is now gaining much broader tra@@ ction – major newspapers now report a bro@@ a@@ dening criminal probe by the federal government – and by new y@@ or@@ k ’ s state at@@ tor@@ ney general – into the us financial sector ’ s residential lending and related securities practices .
with sen@@ ators patri@@ ck le@@ ah@@ y and ch@@ u@@ ck grass@@ ley , kauf@@ man worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud .
more recently , kauf@@ man was devastating in his cross-@@ examination of gol@@ d@@ man sach@@ s exec@@ u@@ tives .
sen@@ ator car@@ l lev@@ in , chairman of the sub@@ committee that heard their testi@@ mon@@ y , evi@@ dently seeing eye to eye with kauf@@ man , was just as tough after a year-@@ long investigation of wash@@ ington mutual , gol@@ d@@ man , and the ab@@ ject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies .
kauf@@ man sco@@ red an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explo@@ sive growth of high-@@ frequency trading , which is little understood by ameri@@ ca ’ s main financial wat@@ ch@@ dog , the securities and exchange commission ( se@@ c ) , and poses system@@ ic market risk .
his concerns appear to have been v@@ indicated by the 20-@@ minute sh@@ ut@@ down of trading in new y@@ or@@ k on may 6 , when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function : price discovery between bu@@ yers and s@@ ellers .
we do not yet know what combination of black@@ -@@ box computer programs and electronic trading algorith@@ ms , inter@@ acting across more than 50 market centers , caused this catastro@@ phe .
but our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind “ financial innovation . ”
kauf@@ man ’ s approach – with speeches on the sen@@ ate floor as a central feature – seemed ir@@ relevant or even qu@@ a@@ int to critics even a few weeks ago .
no significant wall street voices acknowledged his concerns – prefer@@ ring instead to praise the equity markets as a sh@@ ining example of well-@@ functioning technology .
as sen@@ ator mark war@@ ner gra@@ ci@@ ously acknowledged , “ the sen@@ ator from del@@ aware so@@ unded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fra@@ c@@ tional mill@@ is@@ ec@@ ond advantage in the trading process might come back and ha@@ unt us all ... i ’ ve been proud to follow his lead . ”
the se@@ c was once a great and powerful independent agency .
it fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership .
yet it still does not rout@@ inely collect the data that it needs – tra@@ des by time and customer – to understand the actions and impact of large traders .
kauf@@ man has consistently pressed them to do more – and do it much faster ; to be sure , they and many others are now listening .
on a third issue , the results so far are mixed .
kauf@@ man champi@@ oned the case for making ameri@@ ca ’ s biggest banks smaller , as part of comprehensive finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ reform efforts .
his advoc@@ acy helped build support and forced a sen@@ ate floor vote on an amendment , co-@@ spon@@ sored with sen@@ ator sh@@ er@@ ro@@ d bro@@ wn , that would have imposed a hard cap on banks ’ size and leverage ( debt relative to assets ) .
the amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable , yet it went down to defeat , 3@@ 3-@@ 61 , also on may 6 .
it might have gained more support just a few days later – after sen@@ ators witnessed the ba@@ il@@ out of the giant eurozone banks .
still , it has strengthened backing for another amendment , spon@@ sored by sen@@ ators je@@ ff merk@@ ley and car@@ l lev@@ in , which would restrict propri@@ etary trading by me@@ gab@@ an@@ ks for their own account – coinci@@ dentally a practice that is presu@@ med to be a large and “ dark ” part of high-speed trading .
the deeper and over@@ riding point of kauf@@ man ’ s critique of our system is the need for tough laws .
we cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing .
in particular , regulators have no chance to look over the horiz@@ on and act pre@@ ven@@ tively when markets are op@@ a@@ que , and when powerful wall street interests ( and their capit@@ ol hill allies ) can circle the w@@ ag@@ ons and claim that there is no problem .
unfortunately , despite his new@@ found promin@@ ence on the national stage , kauf@@ man will be out of office at the end of this year – he was appointed to fill vice president jo@@ e bi@@ den ’ s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-@@ election .
when he goes , dangerous elements on wall street will no doubt brea@@ the a si@@ gh of relief .
let ’ s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues – preparing the ground for further con@@ gres@@ sional action aimed at a serious tigh@@ tening of safeguards over the financial sector .
kauf@@ man ’ s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-@@ evident : rel@@ ying on dereg@@ ulation and self-@@ interest in today ’ s complex , op@@ a@@ que markets will manifest@@ ly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth .
we must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets .
afri@@ ca ’ s necessary data revolution
wash@@ ington , d@@ c – since the term “ data revolution ” was introduced , there has been a fl@@ urr@@ y of activity to define , develop , and implement an agenda to transform the collection , use , and distribution of development statistics .
that makes sense .
assessing the international community ’ s next development agenda , regardless of its details , will be impossible without accurate data .
yet , in sub-@@ sah@@ aran afri@@ ca – the region with the most potential for progress under the forthcoming sustainable development goals – accurate data are severely lacking .
from 1990 to 2009 , only one sub-@@ sah@@ aran country had data on all 12 indicators established in 2000 by the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals .
indeed , of the 60 countries with complete vital statistics , not one is in afri@@ ca .
while most afri@@ can countries have likely experienced economic growth during the last decade , the accuracy of the data on which growth estimates are based – not to mention data on inflation , food production , education , and vaccination rates – remains far from adequate .
in@@ accurate data can have serious consequences .
consider ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s experience earlier this year , when g@@ d@@ p re@@ bas@@ ing showed that the economy was nearly 90 % larger than previously thought .
the distor@@ ted picture of ni@@ geri@@ a ’ s economy provided by the previous statistics likely led to mis@@ guided decisions regarding private investment , credit rat@@ ings , and taxation .
moreover , it meant that ni@@ geri@@ a was allocated more international aid than it mer@@ ited – aid that could have gone to nee@@ di@@ er countries .
contrary to popular belief , the constraints on the production and use of basic data stem not from a shortage of technical capacity and kno@@ wh@@ ow , but from underlying political and system@@ ic challenges .
for star@@ ters , national statistical offices often lack the institutional autonomy needed to protect the integrity of data , production of which thus tends to be influenced by political forces and special interest groups .
po@@ or@@ ly designed policies also undermine the accuracy of data .
for example , governments and donors sometimes tie funding to self-@@ reported measures , which creates incentives for recipi@@ ents to over-@@ report key data like vaccination or scho@@ ol-@@ en@@ roll@@ ment rates .
without effective over@@ sight , these well-@@ inten@@ tioned efforts to reward progress can go aw@@ ry .
despite these fail@@ ings , national governments and international donors continue to devote far too few resources to ensuring the collection of adequate data .
only 2 % of official development aid is earmarked for improving the quality of statistics – an amount wholly insufficient to assess accurately the impact of the other 98 % of aid .
and governments ’ dependen@@ cy on donors to fund and gather their core statistics is un@@ sustainable .
in fact , stronger national statistical systems are the first step toward improving the accuracy , tim@@ el@@ iness , and availability of the data that are essential to calcul@@ ating almost any major economic or soci@@ al-@@ welfare indicator .
these include statistics on bir@@ ths and deaths ; growth and poverty ; tax and trade ; health , education , and safety ; and land and the environment .
developing such systems is an ambitious but achie@@ vable goal .
all that is needed is a willingness to experiment with new approaches to collecting , using , and sharing data .
this is where the public comes in .
if private firms , media , and civil@@ -@@ society organizations identify specific problems and call publicly for change , their governments will feel pressure to take the steps needed to produce accurate , un@@ bi@@ ased data – for example , by enhancing the autonomy of national statistical offices or providing sufficient funds to hire more qualified personnel .
while it may be temp@@ ting to b@@ yp@@ ass government and hope for an easy techn@@ olog@@ y-@@ based solution , sustainable , credible progress will be difficult without public-@@ sector involvement .
the recognition by governments and external donors of the need for more – and more efficient – funding , particularly to national statistical systems , will be integral to such a shift .
establishing stronger incentives for agencies to produce good data – that is , data that are accurate , timely , relevant , and re@@ adily available – would also help , with clearly del@@ ine@@ ated met@@ rics defining what quali@@ fies as “ good . ”
in fact , t@@ ying progress on those met@@ rics to funding via pa@@ y-@@ for@@ -@@ performance agreements could improve development outcomes considerably .
one concrete strategy to achieve these goals would be to create a countr@@ y-@@ donor compact for better data .
such a compact would enable governments and donors to express their shared intention to build a national statistics system over a period of several years , with clear and veri@@ fiable mile@@ stones .
it would also provide a countr@@ y-@@ specific framework for innovation on funding mechanisms and the engagement of civil society and the private sector , while mobi@@ liz@@ ing new technologies for data collection and dissemination .
in short , a data compact would help to mobili@@ ze and focus domestic and donor funding to achieve national statistical priorities .
data are the currency of performance , accountability , and credibility in the global economy , and improvements in data have been linked to better governance and higher levels of private investment .
that is just what afri@@ ca needs to support a new decade of growth and development .
lon@@ don – nearly everyone who s@@ its on goo@@ gle ’ s board of directors has at least one computer science or engineering degree or doc@@ torate .
there are two university presiden@@ ts and emin@@ ent schol@@ ars – stan@@ ford university ’ s j@@ oh@@ n h@@ enn@@ ess@@ y and former pr@@ inc@@ et@@ on university president shir@@ ley til@@ gh@@ man – and several members of the national ac@@ ade@@ my of engineering and other illu@@ stri@@ ous organizations .
for goo@@ gle , it pays to have technical expertise at the top .
but goo@@ gle is an unusual corporate giant in promoting those with scientific pro@@ w@@ ess to the top of the management lad@@ der .
beyond si@@ lic@@ on valley , few senior corporate exec@@ u@@ tives bo@@ ast technical expertise in the products that their companies produce .
ameri@@ can bo@@ ard@@ rooms are filled with mb@@ as , especially from har@@ v@@ ard , while firms in the rest of the developed world ( with the possible exception of ger@@ many ) seem to prefer professional managers over technical or scientific talent .
nowadays , it seems as anom@@ al@@ ous to have knowledge workers serve as professional leaders as it once did to have scientists in the bo@@ ard@@ room .
it was previously thought that leadership is less necessary in knowledge-@@ intensive organizations , where experts were assumed to be superior because they were motivated by intellectual pleasure rather than such ex@@ trin@@ sic motiv@@ ations as profit growth and cost targets .
this difference in attitude is evident in many areas of society , not least in hospitals in the united states and the united king@@ dom , where knowledge-@@ intensive medical practi@@ tioners operate separately from managers .
hospitals used to be run by doctors ; today , only 5 % of us hospitals ’ ce@@ os are medical doctors , and even fewer doctors run uk hospitals . “ medicine should be left to the doctors , ” according to a common refrain , “ and organiz@@ ational leadership should be left to professional managers . ”
but this is a mistake .
research shows that hig@@ her@@ -@@ performing us hospitals are likely to be led by doctors with outstanding research rep@@ ut@@ ations , not by management professionals .
the evidence also suggests that hospitals perform better , and have lower death rates , when more of their managers up to board level are clin@@ ically trained .
we see similar findings in other fields .
my research shows that the world ’ s best universities , for example , are likely to be led by exceptional schol@@ ars whose performance continues to improve over time .
de@@ part@@ ment@@ al-@@ level analysis supports this .
a university economics department , for example , tends to perform better the more widely its head ’ s own research is c@@ ited .
with experts in charge , it may not always look like there is an effective reporting structure in place .
but , as the academic saying goes : just because you cannot her@@ d c@@ ats , does not mean there is not a fel@@ ine hierarch@@ y .
as with c@@ ats , academ@@ ics operate a “ relative hierarch@@ y ” in which the person in charge changes , depending on the setting .
even in the world of sports , where success is not an obvious preparation for management , we see interesting lin@@ k@@ ages between experience and organiz@@ ational performance .
the very best n@@ ba bas@@ ket@@ ball players often make top co@@ aches , while former formula 1 champi@@ on drivers are associated with great team performance .
of the 92 so@@ cc@@ er clubs in the english football le@@ ague , club managers played an average of 16 years in senior clubs .
al@@ ex fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , argu@@ ably b@@ rit@@ ain ’ s best manager , sco@@ red an average of one goal every two games in his professional career .
but where the pattern does occur , especially in the business world , we should take note .
the senior partner of any professional services firm is likely to have been a top perform@@ er during a long career with the firm .
this might be because experts and professionals in knowledge-@@ intensive organizations prefer a bo@@ ss who has excell@@ ed in their field .
the leader ’ s credibility is vital : if she sets high standards , it seems only right that she should have matched or exceeded them herself .
in short , she must lead by example .
this sort of leadership arrangement creates a virtu@@ ous circle .
a leader with prior experience knows how her sub@@ ordin@@ ates feel , how to motiv@@ ate them , and how to create the right working environment .
she probably makes better h@@ iring decisions , too – after all , the best scienti@@ st or physi@@ cian is more likely than a professional manager to know which researchers or doctors have the greatest potential .
the problem , however , is not simply that today ’ s leaders lack technical knowledge ; it is that experts are often reluc@@ tant to lead .
but that can change .
by communic@@ ating the importance of management and leadership early in a specialist ’ s career , and by offering tailored , di@@ ges@@ tible , and jar@@ g@@ on-@@ free training , we could bridge the gap .
many medical schools are already considering including management education as part of the cur@@ ricul@@ um .
the tri@@ ck is to get experts , who are trained to go ever deeper into their speci@@ alization , to step back and view the big picture .
with the right preparation , there is no reason why a leader cannot speci@@ alize and manage .
the results could be remarkable .
think of how governments run by scientists with management skills might respond to climate change .
top minds should be put to top use .
a man@@ ia for diagno@@ sing bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order
provi@@ dence , ri – during the past few years , many experts have suggested that bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order – a serious illness resulting in significant psycho@@ social mor@@ bi@@ dity and excess mortality – is under-@@ recognized , particularly in patients with major de@@ pression .
the clinical implications of the failure to recognize bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order in de@@ pressed patients include the under-@@ pres@@ cription of mo@@ o@@ d-@@ stabili@@ zing medic@@ ations , and an increased risk of rapid “ cycling ” – sw@@ ings between man@@ ic and de@@ pres@@ sive phases .
but , perhaps as a consequence of concer@@ ted efforts to improve the recognition of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , during the past few years we have observed the emergence of an opposite phenomenon – over-@@ diagnosis .
in my own practice , my colleagues and i have encountered patients who reported that they were previously diagno@@ sed with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , despite lacking a history of man@@ ic or h@@ yp@@ om@@ an@@ ic episo@@ des .
to be sure , we have also seen patients seeking treatment for de@@ pression who really did have bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
however , there seemed to be more over-@@ diagnosis than under-@@ diagnosis .
we therefore conducted a study to examine emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cally how often bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order might be over@@ - and under-@@ diagno@@ sed .
seven hundred psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric out@@ patients were inter@@ viewed with the structured clinical interview for d@@ sm@@ -@@ i@@ v ( sci@@ d ) and completed a self-@@ administer@@ ed question@@ n@@ aire that asked whether they had been previously diagno@@ sed by a heal@@ th-@@ care professional with bi@@ pol@@ ar or man@@ ic-@@ de@@ pres@@ sive dis@@ order .
family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate rel@@ atives .
slightly more than 20 % ( 14@@ 5 patients ) in our sample reported that they had been previously diagno@@ sed as having bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , significantly higher than the 12.@@ 9 % rate based on the sci@@ d .
less than half of those who reported that they had been previously diagno@@ sed with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order were diagno@@ sed with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order based on the sci@@ d .
patients with sci@@ d-@@ diagno@@ sed bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order had a significantly higher risk of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order in their immediate family members than patients who self-@@ reported a previous diagnosis of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order that was not confirmed by the sci@@ d .
patients who self-@@ reported a previous diagnosis of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order that was not confirmed by the sci@@ d did not have a significantly higher risk for bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order than the patients who were negative for bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order by self-@@ report and the sci@@ d .
our findings , vali@@ dated by family history , thus suggest that bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order was over-@@ diagno@@ sed .
such is the nature of the im@@ perfect reliability of psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric diagnosis .
the question , then , is not whether some patients previously given a diagnosis do not seem to have it upon re-@@ interview , but rather how many .
how high the percentage should be before claiming over-@@ diagnosis is a significant problem and a value judgment .
but we think that an over-@@ diagnosis rate of more than 50 % cross@@ es the clinical significance threshold .
over-@@ diagnosis of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order has costs .
mood stabili@@ z@@ ers are the treatment of choice , and , depending on the medic@@ ation , they can produce potentially significant health comp@@ lications affecting ren@@ al , endo@@ cr@@ ine , h@@ ep@@ atic , imm@@ un@@ ologi@@ c , or met@@ abo@@ lic function .
thus , over-@@ diagno@@ sing bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order can un@@ necessarily ex@@ pose patients to serious si@@ de-@@ effects of medic@@ ation .
the impact of marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies and public@@ ity probably plays a role in the emerging tendency to over-@@ diagno@@ se bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
direc@@ t-@@ to-@@ consumer adverti@@ sements that refer individuals to screening question@@ na@@ ires can result in patients sugge@@ sting to their doctors that they have bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
we have seen evidence of this in our practice .
this does not necessarily reflect a problem with the performance of a screening question@@ n@@ aire , but rather how these sc@@ ales are used .
screening question@@ na@@ ires maxim@@ ize sensitivity , at a cost of false positives , because it is presu@@ med that they are followed by expert clinical evaluation .
but insufficient diagno@@ stic rig@@ or can result in over-@@ diagnosis .
clin@@ ici@@ ans are inc@@ lined to diagno@@ se dis@@ orders that they feel more comfortable treating .
we believe that the increased availability of medic@@ ations that have been approved for the treatment of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order might be influ@@ encing clin@@ ici@@ ans who are un@@ sure whether or not a patient has bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order or bor@@ der@@ line personality dis@@ order to er@@ r on the side of diagno@@ sing the dis@@ order that is respon@@ sive to medic@@ ation .
this bi@@ as is reinforced by the marketing message of pharmaceutical companies to physi@@ cians , which has empha@@ sized research on delayed diagnosis and under-@@ recognition of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , possibly sensi@@ tiz@@ ing clin@@ ici@@ ans accordingly .
the campaign against under-@@ recognition has probably resulted in some anxi@@ ous , ag@@ it@@ ated , and / or ir@@ rit@@ able de@@ pressed patients who compla@@ in of in@@ som@@ nia and “ racing thoughts ” being mis@@ diagno@@ sed with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
the results of our study are consistent with prior studies sugge@@ sting possible problems with the diagnosis of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order . with the greater number of medic@@ ations approved for the treatment of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , along with multiple reports cau@@ tioning clin@@ ici@@ ans against under-@@ diagnosis , it appears that over-@@ diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-@@ diagnosis .
both can have negative consequences . while there is still some uncertainty as to the best assessment approach , we recommend that clin@@ ici@@ ans use a standardi@@ zed , vali@@ dated method .
a mar@@ shall plan for the ar@@ ab world
ro@@ me – us president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s major speech on the consequences of the ar@@ ab spring is also a challenge for europ@@ e .
only if the trans@@ -@@ at@@ lan@@ tic partnership proves effective , as it did to meet the demands of the cold war and the end of europ@@ e ’ s division , can the west contribute to re@@ alizing the hopes en@@ gen@@ dered by the ar@@ ab u@@ pris@@ ings .
the crisis in europ@@ e ’ s southern neighbor@@ hood reflects a deep@@ -@@ se@@ ated transformation process that will have long-@@ lasting consequences – for the region , for europ@@ e , and for the world .
the medi@@ terranean region is vital to europ@@ e ’ s peace , stability , and economic growth .
the continent ’ s medi@@ terranean neigh@@ b@@ ors look to europ@@ e as their natural partner .
and events there , including the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ pal@@ est@@ inian peace process , have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners – first and foremost the united states .
current events , not just in li@@ b@@ ya , but also in tun@@ isi@@ a , eg@@ yp@@ t , sy@@ ria , y@@ emen , and bah@@ rain , mirror the political complexity of these countries .
they also spring from different factors , such as frustr@@ ation with rising food prices and widespread corruption , coupled with demands for greater democrati@@ zation , reduction of economic and social inequalities , and job creation .
europ@@ e ’ s response to this process must em@@ body the goal of an order@@ ly and rapid transition .
proposals for some sort of “ partnership for transformation , ” based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , should bear in mind that the region ’ s political landscape looks certain to remain vol@@ atile and ten@@ se in the coming months .
no surprise , then , that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for europ@@ e@@ ans .
cha@@ os , a res@@ ur@@ gence of terrorism , the rise of radical islam@@ ism , and massive waves of immigration towards europ@@ e are just a few of the potential threats to the europ@@ ean union that are now being con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated .
given this , the eu should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region ’ s security .
just as the post-@@ 1945 mar@@ shall plan consist@@ ed of a finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ aid package aimed at re@@ construc@@ ting and re-@@ launching western europ@@ e ’ s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability , the countries of the ar@@ ab spring face similar challenges and needs .
we need to enable countries like eg@@ yp@@ t and tun@@ isi@@ a – and possibly a peaceful li@@ b@@ ya – to strengthen their political stability through democrati@@ zation .
the mar@@ shall plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the us and europ@@ ean recipient countries were on an equal footing .
the aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace .
the situation in the medi@@ terranean region is at a more advanced stage . the broad plan@@ ks of a partnership are already there , so what is now needed is to enhance europ@@ e ’ s integration with its southern neigh@@ b@@ ors .
this is why ital@@ y has proposed a new eu “ plan for the medi@@ terranean ” aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources .
the union for the medi@@ terranean , launched by f@@ ren@@ ch president ni@@ col@@ as s@@ arko@@ zy in 2008 , must be rev@@ itali@@ zed and re-@@ directed towards development projects ranging from high@@ ways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-@@ size enterprises ( sm@@ es ) .
but a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobili@@ ze a critical mass of europ@@ ean and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and moderni@@ ze its infrastructures and services .
let us , together with the us , te@@ ar down the trade and economic barriers that are sti@@ fl@@ ing these economies .
let us also grant some medi@@ terranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progres@@ sively into the eu ’ s internal market and participate in eu programs .
to achieve all of this , a clear set of principles is required .
we europ@@ e@@ ans must favor stability , create a real spirit of co-@@ ownership , and promote political respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ in this new framework , the eu should avoid excessive condi@@ tionality , especially during the transition period .
europ@@ e ’ s strong support for the region ’ s economic development must remain the top priority , as ar@@ ab countries introduce necessary reforms .
moreover , a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task .
one proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the europ@@ ean investment bank ’ s facility for euro@@ -@@ medi@@ terranean investment and partnership ( fem@@ i@@ p ) , which would become an autonomous institution , perhaps head@@ quar@@ tered in the middle east or north afri@@ ca , with shares held by the region ’ s governments ( or other institutions ) and other willing parties .
the lon@@ d@@ on-@@ based europ@@ ean bank for reconstruction and development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region , which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job@@ -@@ creating enterprises .
the eb@@ rd made an important contribution to the economic transition process in eastern europ@@ e ; there ’ s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern medi@@ terranean .
at the same time , the eu must launch a “ dialogue among equ@@ als ” on political and security matters , aimed at confi@@ den@@ ce-@@ building across the region .
a conference on security and cooperation in the medi@@ terranean and the middle east ( c@@ sc@@ m ) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development .
in short , we need to transform the medi@@ terranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability .
we europ@@ e@@ ans cannot afford to turn our backs on our ar@@ ab friends along the far shores of “ mare no@@ stru@@ m . ”
they are part of our collective history , and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build .
ambi@@ valent arab@@ ia
a democratic ti@@ de seems to be swe@@ eping across the ar@@ ab world .
even the traditional ar@@ ab mon@@ arch@@ ies and em@@ ir@@ ates are changing in its wake .
ku@@ wait now allows women to vote , q@@ atar has embra@@ ced an ambitious reform program , bah@@ rain has shown great tolerance of mass demonstrations , and the u.@@ a.@@ e@@ . is allowing something like a free press .
but sau@@ di arab@@ ia continues to be deeply war@@ y of any sort of change , and thus remains a huge and seem@@ ingly im@@ mo@@ vable obstacle to regi@@ on-@@ wide reform .
although the sau@@ di ruling family , the al-@@ sau@@ d , is under enormous pressure to follow the example of its neigh@@ b@@ ors , internal resistance to doing so remains very strong .
so the al-@@ sau@@ d have become jan@@ us-@@ faced : looking in one direction , the ro@@ yal family encourages democratic reform@@ ers to speak out ; looking in the opposite direction , it j@@ ails them when they do .
on may 15 , in a closed trial without legal representation for the accused , three leading reform@@ ers – ali al du@@ main@@ i , a well-known journalist and po@@ et , and university prof@@ essors ab@@ dul@@ lah al ham@@ id and mat@@ ru@@ k al f@@ ali@@ h – were condemned and sent@@ enced to prison terms ranging from six to nine years .
their crime was to call for a constitutional mon@@ arch@@ y .
the official ver@@ dict states that they threatened national unity , challeng@@ ed those in authority , and inc@@ ited public opinion against the state while using “ foreign , ” that is , western , termin@@ ology .
not long after the se@@ p@@ tem@@ ber 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , these liberal reform@@ ers joined with 160 other professionals to write and sign a peti@@ tion to cro@@ wn prin@@ ce ab@@ dul@@ lah asking for reforms .
the peti@@ tion called for the mon@@ arch@@ y to work within constitu@@ tionally prescri@@ bed limits , and for an independent judiciary .
the reform@@ ers believe that such reforms are the only way for sau@@ di arab@@ ia to survive the threat of violence , instability , and national frag@@ mentation that is lo@@ oming on its horiz@@ on .
only a constitution , they argue , can restore much needed legitimacy to a political system that is widely perceived as deeply cor@@ rupt and in@@ ept .
cro@@ wn prin@@ ce ab@@ dul@@ lah , sau@@ di arab@@ ia ’ s de facto rul@@ er in place of his inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ it@@ ated half-@@ brother king f@@ ah@@ d , is keen to be seen as a champi@@ on of reform .
he received these proposals with a warm welcome in jan@@ u@@ ary 2003 .
but his half-@@ brother and more powerful rival , prin@@ ce na@@ if , the minister of interior , ordered the arre@@ sts , trial , and im@@ prison@@ ment of 13 reform@@ ers in mar@@ ch 2004 .
cro@@ wn prin@@ ce ab@@ dul@@ lah offered not a pe@@ ep of opposition , leaving the reform agenda that he initiated in a political ne@@ ther@@ world .
in order to maintain absolu@@ ti@@ st power and to minim@@ ize public anger , the sau@@ di prin@@ ces , led by prin@@ ce na@@ if , asked the reform@@ ers to sign an agreement that they would never again ask for reform .
prin@@ ce na@@ if b@@ ans the very word “ reform ” from public dis@@ course , because it suggests that there is something wrong with the system ; his preferred term is “ development . ”
of the thir@@ teen reform@@ ers who were arrested , ten submitted to this demand , but the other three refused and have paid the price .
they remained in j@@ ail in ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h without legal representation until the final ver@@ dict .
those who submitted had their pas@@ sports withdrawn , lost their jobs , and were forbidden to speak to the press .
under regional and international pressure , the sau@@ di ruling family has constructed a po@@ tem@@ kin village of reform while re@@ taining absolute control over all political developments .
earlier this year , they st@@ aged partial , and tigh@@ tly regulated municipal elections , with no independent opinion permitted to influence when and how the bal@@ lots were held .
these entire female population was excluded , and only one-@@ quarter of the male population was eligible to vote .
inevitably , wah@@ hab@@ i islam@@ ists did best .
the al-@@ sau@@ d face two threats : one from violent islam@@ ists , and the other from liberal reform@@ ers .
there is every indication that they fear the reform@@ ers far more .
perhaps the prin@@ ces believe that it is easier to kill “ terrorist ” criminals than to cr@@ ush demands for social justice .
indeed , killing violent islam@@ ists and al-@@ q@@ a@@ eda affili@@ ates is applau@@ ded by the international community , especially the united states , as success in the “ war on terrorism . ”
but as they hun@@ t down and kill violent domestic extremis@@ ts , they are qui@@ et@@ ly tigh@@ tening the no@@ ose around all those who want moderate reform .
this repression of liberal reform@@ ers passes un@@ noticed in the wider world , with ameri@@ ca ’ s silence particularly notic@@ eable .
this silence is vital to the prin@@ ces , for what the al-@@ sau@@ d care about most is us support .
as things stand in sau@@ di arab@@ ia , the us administration has no credible ally for change outside of the existing regime .
so , unlike in ukra@@ ine , ge@@ or@@ gia , k@@ yr@@ gi@@ z@@ stan , and le@@ ban@@ on , it does nothing to encourage popular opposition .
as long as the sau@@ di regime meets ameri@@ ca ’ s oil needs and f@@ ights islam@@ ist radic@@ als , it will continue to receive us support and silence – and hence its tac@@ it consent .
but turning a blind eye is short@@ si@@ ghted , for ameri@@ ca and for the s@@ audi@@ s .
those who make peaceful revolu@@ tions impossible make violent revolu@@ tions inevitable .
the liberal reform@@ ers who have been j@@ ailed could have pav@@ ed the way for a peaceful transition to a reformed sau@@ di arab@@ ia .
by j@@ ailing them , the regime has made it clear that violence is the only a@@ venue open to those seeking change .
ameri@@ ca after the election
new y@@ or@@ k – the ongoing presidential campaign in the united states stands out for its lack of civil@@ ity and the vast differences between the candidates : the anti-@@ establishment business@@ man don@@ ald tru@@ mp on the re@@ publi@@ can side and the pol@@ ished politi@@ cian h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton representing the democ@@ rats .
the contest has exposed deep fault lines within ameri@@ can society and damaged the country ’ s global reputation .
no surprise , then , that one of the few things ameri@@ cans seem to agree on is that the campaign has gone on for too long .
but soon it will be over .
the question is : what comes next ?
p@@ olls suggest that clin@@ ton , a former sen@@ ator and secret@@ ary of state , will defeat the controversial tru@@ mp .
but p@@ olls are not to be conf@@ used with reality .
after all , going into jun@@ e ’ s bre@@ x@@ it referendum , most observers believed that a victory for “ remain ” was a sure thing .
more recently , col@@ om@@ bian voters rejected a peace acc@@ ord that was widely expected to receive popular approval .
all of this is to say that , while a clin@@ ton victory may be likely , it is no certainty .
the only pol@@ l that counts is the one on nov@@ ember 8 .
until then , all we can do is specul@@ ate .
yet some predic@@ tions can be made with greater confidence .
there is little doubt that the us will emerge from this election a divided country with a divided government , regardless of who is president or which party has a majority in either chamber of congress .
neither democ@@ rats nor re@@ public@@ ans will be able to realize their objectives without at least some support from the other .
but no one should think that the only divide in ameri@@ can politics is between re@@ public@@ ans and democ@@ rats .
in fact , sp@@ l@@ its within the two major parties are just as deep , with large and highly motivated fac@@ tions pul@@ ling each to their respective extre@@ mes – democ@@ rats to the left and re@@ public@@ ans to the right .
this makes compromise on centr@@ ist positions all the more difficult to achieve .
the rapid resu@@ mption of presidential politics will undermine compromise further .
if clin@@ ton wins , many re@@ public@@ ans will assume that it was only because of tru@@ mp ’ s f@@ laws , and they will judge her likely to be a one-@@ term president .
a country favor@@ ing change , they will conclude , is unlikely to keep a democ@@ rat in the o@@ val office for a fourth term .
many re@@ public@@ ans ( especially those who deny the legitimacy of a clin@@ ton victory ) will thus seek to frustr@@ ate her administration , l@@ est she be able to run again in 2020 as a successful inc@@ umb@@ ent .
simil@@ arly , if tru@@ mp manages to win , most democ@@ rats ( and even some re@@ public@@ ans ) will – after recover@@ ing from their surprise and dis@@ may – make it their highest priority to ensure that he does not have an opportunity for a second term .
given how much of tru@@ mp ’ s agenda his fellow policymakers would likely find objec@@ tion@@ able , governing would be very difficult during his administration .
in either scenario , it may still be possible to make progress in a few key areas . the next us government might manage to en@@ act legislation to fund the moderni@@ zation of ameri@@ ca ’ s aging infrastructure , a policy that both candidates and many in congress favor .
it might also be able to co@@ b@@ ble together a majority to reform the us tax code – in particular , lower@@ ing the high rate for corporations and raising taxes on the weal@@ thy .
there could even be some reform of health care , president bar@@ ack ob@@ ama ’ s signature achievement , owing to serious implementation problems with the current system .
but other issues requiring cooperation between congress and the president are unlikely to be addressed any time soon . one is immigration reform , which is as controversial in the us as it is in europ@@ e .
another is trade : because the domestic political environment makes policymakers war@@ y of supporting positions with dedicated opponents , both tru@@ mp and clin@@ ton oppose the trans@@ -@@ p@@ aci@@ fic partnership , even though its ratification would benefit ameri@@ ca ’ s economy and strategic standing .
mean@@ while , ameri@@ ca ’ s deficit and debt are certain to rise , as there seems to be little or no will to reduce entit@@ lement spending .
the foreign@@ -@@ policy implications of the election are somewhat different , because , under the us constitution , the president enjoys considerable l@@ ati@@ tude .
while only congress can officially declare war or ratify treaties , presiden@@ ts may use ( or refuse to use ) military force without explicit con@@ gres@@ sional approval .
they can also enter into international agreements other than treaties , appoint powerful white house staff , and change us foreign policy by executive action , as ob@@ ama recently did regarding cu@@ ba .
under clin@@ ton , this discretion could translate into establishing one or more safe areas in sy@@ ria , providing more def@@ ensive arms to ukra@@ ine , and taking a tou@@ gher line toward north korea as it continues its nuclear and missi@@ le buil@@ du@@ p .
it is more difficult to gu@@ ess what tru@@ mp would do .
he is , after all , a political out@@ si@@ der , so no one knows how much of his campaign rhetoric would be translated into policy .
still , one could anticip@@ ate a tru@@ mp administration dist@@ ancing itself from some traditional allies in europ@@ e and a@@ sia and standing mostly alo@@ of from the middle east .
what exactly will happen to ameri@@ ca after the presidential election remains an open question .
though some outcomes can reasonably be expected , the only genuine certainty is that the 96 % of the world ’ s population that does not vote in us elections will feel the effects no less than ameri@@ cans will .
