you see, in the 1880s, 1890s, there were many scientists, a lot of the observer, the light that went out of atoms.
you can put that on a piece of paper in the lab, and you take a telescope, you think it's going to the sky that there are no dead stars that are bigger than 1.4 sunmasses.
here's a beautiful quote that i found -- it's about the happy accidents -- from alexander fleming: "when i was watching the dawn of 2897 german in 1928 1928, i didn't leave it all over the whole medicine by detecting the world strands."
and she did this picture of the earth.
i don't know why, but i've been amazed by the thought that there are about two and a half billion of us around the internet, and at every time, more than 30 percent of the iranian population online to learn to build content.
and all of you are connected, as you can see, to create a picture of my activities.
when i did my own joint vividly, i made one for my daughter.
and my family and friends were given to hear me speak.
and i was talking about the people about that, i was debated and debated.
so i said, i would be silent, and on my next birthday, what i've learned, and maybe i would talk again.
and i said -- well, rivers and lakes, hydroponics, south america.
so i continued.
if somebody said, when somebody had said, "john, do you want to make something really?"
i don't have to show you my fault, which is in my backpack at the back.
we need to get up who we are, and we're going to go where we will be a different.
in the same year, one day, one day, my sister passed me that she went to china to earn money, but she would soon come back with money and food.
i realized that i couldn't survive in that way.
i didn't change my motivation before he died.
my foster father turned me to this dinner, and he encouraged me and gave me a reason in america.
i'm going to live my life happily, and i'm going to learn in dichoes until i see you, and i promise i can't cry.
my goal was that it's going to recycle my buildings, it will be recycled, because every country builds up and build the pavilion, after half a year, becomes a lot of industritile.
we can make it better.
i built for them from paper tubes for them, and so that the students could build easily, and i used to be able to use easily, as a foundation.
in 2009, in italy, there was a big earthquake in italy in italy.
now i work in new zealand in christchurch.
now, this theory didn't just interest me on paper.
it even in the sound of course, in the sound of the mother's language, it also acts in the motherinstincts, and so that the baby makes something simpler in the hard task to understand and speak in the motherlanguage.
is it being born in a world of wealth or in absence?
fetuses seem to be focused on the inmmcratic environment and display their physiology.
the idea that the prenatal transmission of ptsis is applicable is more theory, but for me a very intriguing one.
is a full demonstration of finger ability.
but if that of us, suddenly, is suddenly something very unexpected, we're laughing.
marco tempest: a magical story
you might remember it as aol-time war-fusion, okay. back then when the biggest deal of all times.
but to make an incentive to create the vaccine, each participants should be given a kilo of lentils.
but the little things that might call user interface is frightening bad.
it's sort of a mechanic world that we would love to be able to live, which is really nice to be nice in spreadsheets, all, and the numerically and the amount you tile and the amount that you do with something that you're doing with something proportional to the extra proportion of success.
because the people who don't have money that didn't have an extraordinary budget, but they realize that you could actually have bigger success with a government program, using the height of the height of the effort, but you're likely to achieve exactly the same outcome when you write the form of function, if you're talking english.
however, it causes an unfortunate situation in which only a tiny fraction of the world can actually be able to participate or benefit by the technologies.
thank you.
i felt overwhelmed.
i believe that this is the path, which is first of the first group of people, of the body, individuals out there in the world.
and over and over again, while i took my interviews and spent my days with them, i heard stories of life lungs and amazing little details of changes.
so this idea that these new economic stories and hope would be divided with friends and family, and it might maybe come together a little bit of money, what they needed for a loan to a loan, that's the little idea that was ultimately interviewing.
maybe you will smile, and you'll want to talk to you about what you already have done.
now, with social networks today, there's an amazing way to increase the number of people around us to grow our own supportive communities.
we need to do that, according to people really use it, just as they used to redesign, kiva, to make all the connections.
are there out there out there out there?
maybe we should patent the universe, and everyone should compute a license for its existence.
our only survival is not dying, not on earth, we're expanding in space.
a few examples.
hi, earth, please.
we know how big the number is up. it's the galaxy.
i know what the consequence of me would be because we had failed arms, and this is a picture i've done about three o'clock in mountain, when we saw the computer monitors, because we had a signal that we thought, "that's a stick." right?
this is interesting for cosmologists.
that's not something like that.
and he gave a lecture. all i remember, is a word: electronics.
i have 18 minutes to tell you what's happened in the last six million years.
this knowledge gives us a very useful background that we can think about our heritage.
and i then said, "no, that's an elephant."
but then compare the skull with a similar age of aging, and the little george bush here, you see the vertical line.
so for example, it's very early for their birth to deal with their environment -- faster than us.
can you imagine what's varioned this report?
it's a place of myths and legends.
and if everybody should be able to hold the rules, of course, you need an effective system for verification and law, because as we have noticed, otherwise, trust behavior.
now to a place where it's something cooler than here, the ross sea in the southern ocean.
but we also know that species like this sea turtles stay in the eastern tropical pacific seasises.
it's not even particularly important to create new laws that relocated that, if you have the privilege of using our resources to the high seas that you have to know where you are and what you do.
so i'm leaving the airplane, go to ted.
now, it's not always taking attention, but that's why they invented mothers.
he said, "that's it, i'm dead, and this is the last post in my blog.
and i think that machines can get better access to human language, and increasingly make large amounts of data, it will be possible to analyze the songs of a whole life -- the tweets, the photos, tweets, the photos, which is just make it in incredibly incredible numbers.
they were just shooting out of voting in the camp.
then he went back and broke down, because he thought there was no hope there would be.
it shows gdp per capita, population ratings, lifespan, and that's it.
the complexity there is unsignificant.
suppose they wanted to produce a laundry.
you can see how that works.
you think it's obvious?
they knew that their hospitals were best medical hospitals, and they thought it was very unethical, trial or experiment.
cochrane wisdom understood that uncertainty, misability, inquestioning, it hurts.
it's full of us, our products, full of our junk, full of our demand.
sorry, think now.
because that's possible.
i know most people don't see that.
maybe we're rejecting.
it's certainly no technical or economic barrier to us.
the earth can support the support when we choose the right path.
that means that for every dollar you're going to take a pay at nine or 10 bucks.
so here's a little bit of advice.
68 is young today.
let's give you a love of love in this conversation.
so you take a resveratrol and you put it in beer.
today she runs around with their children.
remember, a turingtest is when you have a wall with someone talking to someone on the other side of the wall, and not know whether it's about a human or animal, and that's the moment in the computer of human intelligence.
of course, the future is going back to see 200 years back, next week, is 200, birthday of darwin.
and then, a brilliant inventor of walking, a scientist who found a part of a cure for this disease.
and as he was thinking, the expensive way he didn't think about it, so he thought, "i don't know about science, but with data, i should i look at the data and see if these expensive, hard, hard techniques actually works better than the cheap and simple."
goal is to be the largest bar in the diagram.
and i said, "great idea."
so, by the way, this car car is reduced to detroit ratings, by the way, by average ratings.
it's simple -- you can browse it -- it's behind the seat.
with the data of new jersey, it acts differently, it's not just lethal accidents, but all accidents that are registered there, and it turns out that difference of 10 percent, but most frequently smaller injuries.
impossible in theory, but it's possible in practice.
this is a bunch of memory, labor memory -- nine hexabyte.
so what you really need is actually a lot is a "cloudbook."
one consequence of it is, i think we're seeing this current spectrum of media -- tv, film, video -- to a media media.
so you went on to have without control.
there's a million social pages on the web.
and we protegger and say, "oh, that's bad."
we're going to have better words for it.
i started caring about that.
what i had to admit to you with high abclau was i understand it.
but it's a human problem, a scientific, if you want to.
and these things are the reflection of processes, and the time that they're creating.
and the project -- a massive competition -- on the hudson river and in new york, that you asked us three years ago using these processes.
it has a material identity, and it's transparent, and it's transparent, and it allows us a whole different idea of a building shell.
this is going to be the first building in the united states without — well, i can't tell, without air conditioning. it's a hybrid.
and then it's again while you started to find a tectonic solution, and there's school.
and then the shell -- the corners of it -- noted all the dynamics, the motion of the building as a series of seismic absorb, geologic layers. right?
thom mayne: architecture
no, no, better yet -- the of cooked food lives.
this simple and simple technology that was designed, works on this formula.
reward: that complex and all of our brains, the very different elements, the outside of the universe and the inner conditions, how we feel, etc.
and this brain is about taking care of its muscles and protecting the surface, and we feed our own cooking food.
despite the solution of a healthy hunger signal, it doesn't ignore the big brain, and it activates another program in the gut.
if we add the matrix, if we have a structural language that we need to learn if we can learn it, we could generate a balance and generate a balance that comes from a very distorted technology: cooking.
we're all encoded from the same genetic wood.
our fantasies are playing children in underwear.
you go back up here within 24 hours.
when i spoke at the first ted conference, i showed a picture of two men of the elder brothers who are running out survivors of el dorado.
i went to the arhuacos, and the wonderful thing about this story was that this guy, danilo's fand, first of a very short look.
because we had taught people to film people, we were able to continue to work, and our wiwa and arhuina filmmakers to make the last shots for the film while we returned to the other arhuaco to the sea, and we brought the elements from the highline.
you're the unique answer on this fundamental question: what does it mean to be a human and live?
and worse, when it's when it comes the way into our natural environment -- on the side of the side or the coast of a river.
because nature is, in nature form the recycling system.
and he begins to digest cases and convert into the next five days into biocomproductives.
the biological income is really important.
and the atoms themselves have tobs are beautiful, but if they fire laser, they're exposed to right to the right frequency, an atom just absorb the photons of the tendency to slow down.
surprisingly, to work.
our leadership is working to find new ways to save money.
and this is -- -- that's a lot of challenging than i've learned to be all the speakers before me and all those who are going to get after me.
and she thought about my work of mathematical models that should promote evolution and modern genetics.
the other half of the audience may not like head-tail-tail -- deep, cultural reasons, keep it for boring -- and find another pattern more interesting -- head-tail-head.
you can think about two ways of thinking about it.
if you throw a coin, you get a series of head and you get a number.
we don't know what caused them.
now, in 100 cancers, the test is 99 percent, and 99 percent will be positive.
how did he come to the one in 73 million?
we want to know how likely -- in relation to each other -- the two explanations are.
we don't really measure of probability.
thank you.
the security manuals on the machine are left in your stecker.
you can't cut into one side.
so even though china is totally censored, booming the chinese network.
but these two very clever seed techniques didn't prevent that social media was becoming a public place, a medium for public opinion, and a nightmare dream for chinese people.
you can almost bring any academic elements.
one of them is yao chen. she's the most famous microblogging in china and has about 21 million readers.
but notice that this cathplus mouse play has a very fun feature.
you just give you a window where they're not censored in.
that's what we expect from our senses.
mom: that's a eule.
john niparko: so you've written two books already?
language is a different way. the language is very accurate.
so the music didn't think that way.
it pausing the question the question of whether it gives me hope at all.
joseph: i was born in 1986.
they wouldn't be lazy; they would want perfect hearing.
for you, and you've got that, you might, feeling so close to a gun, to be comfortable.
the story of him as a defense soldier in the dutch army at the beginning of the second world war.
in fact, in fact, i took the gun -- not to kill, not to destroy, but to stop the judges, the bad guys to defend the vulnerable to protect democratic values, to govern the vulnerable to the more democratic values in amsterdam, talking about how to the world improve the world.
it's more likely to stay more than having a war.
until then, i represent my father, i announced my father's trying to shoot with an old wattz.
this is a computer program from fax and zeros.
you can look at your surface with a microscope.
so, the way is a good thing. not counting.
you focus on the consequences of failing the consequences of what you do, because each of your movement requires the full concentration and thinking processes to perform it effectively.
nano's energy cells could provide the amount of energy from where it's needed.
the human genome was about 1990.
we used to use the point of advanced generation of technology to create the next generation.
we live in a three-dimensional world; we can also use the third dimension.
but what we're actually seeing is that we even keep up.
and at the time, it costs under a tenth of a cent.
there are four important conferences about the emerging blood ent devices; there are many experiments in animals.
by 2010 to 2010, computers will disappear.
if you really look at exponential power growth, then you see these things are fairly soon available.
i want to believe, and they want to.
is that a dangerous predator or only the wind?
and what do you see here?
a similar experiment was done by a different swiss psychologist, peter brugger, who found that vastly meaningful patterns about the left face of the left rise in the right brain, than in the left of the left.
right, and they're creative, and they don't fall on too much nonsense.
that's the tail's tail, folks.
a pretty well-known illusion -- first was done with margaret thatcher first.
was john fam, kennedy was killed by a conspiracy or a single victory?
you can -- what i've done -- michael perell chief of the god who beat her temporal lobe with electrotic waves.
okay.
i forget the names of the army, i think it's called "resistance army of god," but also the government doesn't have any white path, so let's looking at the first video.
in my country, it was -- we saw pictures of british soldiers called the young iraq, we've got abu ghraib, we have guantananyo bay.
it seems to be able to start at the end of the end, because it's a waste product that comes out of other animals, but still it contains nutrients, it contains enough nutrients that dung beetles can live, and their larvae eat frog.
so next thing we've asked ourselves about how do that?
look at his response.
the dung pill is leaving a little temperature shadow, and the beetle's clightened the pill and wips over his face, trying constantly to try to his face refrigeration and the hot sand that he runs.
using the so-called lead orientation, he won't find home. it's going to come up at the wrong place. at the vector orientation, he's doing his steps or measure his steps or a measure.
well, a dung beetle has a rivannsized brain, but it does shows a huge amount of intelligence, if it comes to the point, its food source -- animal excrelic divides, and how does that? everything? it will lead to a dance.
so if we look at these sounds visually, then we might get a result.
there's no sub-titles of the ted title, and we miss them, but if you've seen enough talks, then you hear the spiritual ear, and then the applause begins.
maybe the first person standing up everest. more than 30 years before edmund hillary.
the journey took 10 weeks and 72 days.
but bandura is still incomplete ends.
dsr: humans. people, you know! that's it -- you're the person.
even if you haven't done it before, you've learned a lesson that is useful for you at the next time.
because there will be problems.
but you have to reach in a few seconds that their emotional awareness is focused on them.
on the other hand, there's a lot to be devoted to me that drives the emotional level, and you have to recover again.
on what do you pay attention?
and i look at the logo, and it burns me.
and everyone has competition.
after all that, you've explained to me, you've got to get it to this conclusion.
use a use.
so i decided to see that the name of the game would be, or my neworiginal act.
i'd like it with intent there, but if i were going to be there, there was a helpful left to the band, "the beatles," but i just wanted to get normal beetles.
i like to participate. i like magic.
when i click on the side of pittsburgh, gagi arin page, i come to this surprisingly little guy who is incredibly heroic.
but why, steve, need us a revolution?
so it's not surprising that only 62 percent of the typical gares are optimized for the future.
be serious.
a true story: i was looking for a school for my kid.
this cannot be, just because of play.
dolphins who have big brains play a lot.
there are benefits in games.
it improves our courage to a change.
there's nothing special in the times of the times that is happening, except from the serious meme we're supposed to kick out.
discover it. because you're the leaders, the innovation leaders, the masters of ideas are.
so in summary, we need a process change in our thinking and behavior, but we don't need a group of a workers.
but of course, i've been working for 1925 and more or less like what you see here. this is castleton.
that means that i didn't get led -- the work wasn't going to do me -- i just asked objects, because i wanted to see the world.
the director said there would be multiple women in shapes and burning, and then they were sold to america.
i had been branded, i would have been prepared for success for cybercriminals's success.
this is my camera, brilliant. the first -- that i shot with my bob dylan film 35 years ago.
so i started to say, "hey, boy, you're just too much!
rg: you might remember, we fell in love with love.
rg: so that's why we want to share with four tabts of parenting with them today.
we presented the evolution of love to our child grafish.
i felt connected to my environment.
so, of course, this was a very difficult time -- really painful.
essentially, there's a stem-load of happiness in the relationship of the relationship, which, as we all know, intimately attached to universal happiness, and it going back to the first child.
rg: so in reality, we share general happiness.
rufus griscom + alisa: let's talk about the dishes of your parenting
he died 25 years ago, and was born in exactly 75 years ago.
many of you can afford them.
now i realized that -- yesterday, it fell together.
every time i hear that, i get gooseskin.
it's not to believe that yet not once happened a year since the extraordinary moment, the financial economy and the credit of the economy are moving, frozen.
now, since then, i've been wondering why capitalism is incredibly efficient in some things, but so more efficient in others, why it's so innovative in small ways that it's so innovative at all.
and also, you can see the spread of time banks and parallel currencies, people who use the clever technologies to connect all the resources that have been free -- people, buildings, buildings -- to make the ones that most urgent.
and that's exactly the problem.
in the mid-atlantic, many governments have launched their own innovation labs.
i'm not saying that the bulk would be before to go to the barricaction and make any extra banker at the nearest latin court -- so that might be as well.
now, since we see these huge differences in savings, it would be the language that language has something to do with these differences?
you can say, "yesterday, yesterday," here's what it rains, "tomorrow it rain."
just to illustrate this, let's take a look at the oecd diagram.
they find nine countries in the world where there are a great proportion of the population of both languages as well.
it's almost impossible to find a savings behavior where the strong effect doesn't happen.
there could there any relationship there?
let me, let me tell me that if i had an expert, dutch people, who would have the remedy for cancer, i would prevent that he comes to my british university?
this system sets intelligence into english confidence, which is a very cheap measure.
if you don't think of an idea, you're stuck.
then the navy-pilot, i started flying with the electric plane, i flew an electrical missile and looked at electromissile planes as a kind of a hobby, but then i met a couple of professors from the kind of three professors that convinced me in the field that you could do, that you could do that very close science.
i hired me to be imagining a space station that visited the earth all 5,000 years ago.
we are the boss. i fear it.
essentially a principle, a high-tech example of where we can miniaturization, when the controls is outside the vehicle.
the nest the will always positioned.
compassion helps him to escape from the feeling of suffering, the most allest, terrible suffering that the one person experienced and expands his attention to the other selves, even for those of its misfigurations, and the growth of living.
another three years, no vision. again, it breaks.
suddenly, he had a dischanted idea.
so he took the maitreya -- this was a bullet -- on his shoulder.
and i actually was your mother.
and so you do it. you take every living thing that seems strange you and recognize how to be familiar with you.
they would enjoy it somewhere and enjoy a good time.
in buddhism, it comes back to the future.
and all of you know about the subject that i'm supposed to talk about.
and here i've changed this quote of printing stewart stewart by saying that we can think about something that is thinking about something that's going to take on the cellphone to the cellphone, the internet and constellations by saying that they're just -- the functions just are simple -- the functions what that simplicity is when we see it.
and there's a lot reward about complexity and emergence, and not so very about simplicity.
now, imagine this too to a city or a society, and you have an interesting problem.
so the second layer is the simplicity of the transistor and the internet.
you can build in russian cathedrals, you need to know what it does.
and, in health workers in these parts of the earth around 1818, who have no work that have no work and ready to take around and make these kinds of things, a video phone, and the doctor can look at it.
gw: well, no.
but it's the combination of the internet and motivated consumer users -- which are vulnerable and disresolution, which have the means that they need, and then it comes in a kind of "explosion creative collaboration.
all our patents, all of our patents, our whole approach to patens and new inventions, is based on the assumption that the invention knows what the invention is, if we can tell what it is.
and the range of globalization, this equipment has become cheaper.
what is to be allowed to be created for inventions, which is to be organized by knowledge. they're becoming increasingly used by big companies to develop an enormous on patents to prevent innovation.
what you can see, i think, is two key things, and that is, i think, two challenges for the charter.
just simply because it doesn't use it.
see that?
and i thought, for the internet for all the employees who suffer under stress of stress, to help them to help you, with the things you in your job.
and i said, "if you put this album, i'll deliver it to him, but you've got to figure out who this ray actually is," because his name was all i had: ray. and, of course, this little piece of music, and that his daughter was pissed.
and i promise you, if you go from google streetview, eventually the moment come back to something that comes right away.
you can look at these days online.
one of them really was really out.
and she made a kind of description like how to feel when you care about it.
when i get the brains, i don't know what i look at there.
but if you have this gene, the teacher will be bathed into serotonin, in this way, the whole brain is unsensitive to serotonin, it's unsensitive later.
here's it: "retitled," a historic book.
this is the large hadron collider.
well, if particle physics, we're more ambitious.
but they don't notice them because the weak force of their name is too, very tiny range and very weak, so they're just flying through them.
but there is a problem.
so if you move a particle with the universe, it can emerge with these higgs particles.
but it's really so that with this theory of the laws of physics, at the time of the big bang, it seems an absolutely wonderful forecast. the model has not created that this is happening, but it seems to be done.
at least one of the planet, it may be changed on one of these planets, primitive lives, and in the course of millions of years, in things that went upright and left it about 3.5 million years ago in the mud of today in the tanzania, and ultimately in a different world.
in another year book, i discovered a picture of barack obama.
in addition to his theories, the ancient species, "charles darwin wrote about the theory of the emotional expression.
but the effort of colors was not just an artistic act.
but at the second question, half of the people they didn't like to think they're going on.
and the answer to their questions came from a voice that came out of this dark hole and, on the other side, a mysterious hand that showed out to take the documents while in the old documents.
it's not just about politicians and the law.
we didn't even see anything like haiti before.
and it was used also used in hot issues, like the future of consciousness for sexual violence.
you also have your own news strip of news on youtube, with 1,500 bars right now.
we need a need technology ratings in the leadership and answer this question, "what would make amazon or google with this data?"
i'm a writer, and i'm interested in itself, because the self and fiction have a lot of similarities.
we need to understand the zeitgeist to understand the cause and effect, not just in the tangible world, but also in our desire and movement.
and it's hard to use, but also to be afraid.
it cannot be saved.
i'm always searching for trying to find ways of seeing stories of very ordinary people to share and documenting.
and then we went to a fish restaurant, and chad, the surp guy, he was doing us, and he came up to us and my mom, and my mother said, "did any pediatrician, young?"
and she told this woman.
so that made me feel good, because he had seen a lot of things.
so i'm sure i thought i was going to take a book or a t-shirt, but i found a ray sheep.
the igelies said they created their gods themselves.
chris abani shares the story: people who claim to the soldiers, people who are compassionate, people who are human and their humanity, "ubuntu," he says: the only way for me to be human, is that listening to me my humanity.
so virtually life on earth is almost wiped out of five times.
svante paabo has the answer.
why should that play play?
and if you think about what the potential means -- you can put a complete copy of an organism from any cells from any cells.
this is what it looks like in 2000.
or maybe it's chemicals.
and has a consumption of 15 watts.
below the right now, on the right, you see a robot that leads a 360 degrees centigrade in less than half a second.
so the robot is a little bit of what we call a station curve with minimency.
so i want to show you a quick film, from aphages desert ants, like in professor stephen pratt lab.
and you see, these robots are really close.
this robot is found out of what these properties are.
this guy is called the so-called bee beard.
the floars are sheets, if we eat it, we've gone out, but that's a scarce view of pollination.
the trains that drive into the metropoles, you might have an all-subtle pollen wearing and make the city for a supermarket for bees.
people think very active thinking about our own health.
so we have some pictures of honey from brooklyn.
if you don't just just do one of these california dense cogaers, bread is a standard standard.
in the tens of tens of thousands of years that agriculture has developed, most of our ancestors were actually connected to farmers or extensively to connect.
so what happens?
bread has found its way in tropical countries, where the middle class eats bike and hamburger, and where the commuter is more practical than rice or maniam rice or.
but this is a deceptive.
we need smart, scalable automation that need the problems that we've had with liberzation in a large scale, avoided.
and we need to think of ourselves unbiased about the fundamental benefits of sound and large scales.
you know, they're part of those enormous range of events.
